</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the thirty-third sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our last sermon, the other day, we happened to mention that
in developing the noble eightfold path fully intent on Nibbāna, all the other
enlightenment factors, namely the four foundations of mindfulness, the four
right endeavours, the four bases for success, the five spiritual faculties, the
five powers and the seven factors of enlightenment go to fulfilment by
development.</p>
<p>Though we started analyzing the way in which the Buddha clarified the
above-mentioned peculiarity of the noble eightfold path in the
<em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, we could not finish it.</p>
<p>From the sutta passage we quoted the other day, we could see how the lack of
knowledge of things as they are in regard to the six-fold sense-sphere gives
rise to attachments, entanglements and delusions. As a result of it, the five
aggregates of grasping get accumulated, leading to an increase in craving that
makes for re-becoming, as well as an increase in bodily stresses and torment,
mental stresses and torment, bodily fevers and mental fevers, and bodily and
mental suffering.</p>
<p>Today, to begin with, let us discuss the rest of that discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñca kho, bhikkhave, jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, rūpe jānaṁ passaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhuviññāṇaṁ jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhusamphassaṁ jānaṁ
passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ
vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tampi jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhusmiṁ na
sārajjati, rūpesu na sārajjati, cakkhuviññāṇe na sārajjati, cakkhusamphasse na
sārajjati, yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā
dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tasmimpi na sārajjati.</em></p>
<p><em>Tassa asārattassa asaṁyuttasa asammūḷhassa ādīnavānupassino viharato āyatiṁ
pañcupādānakkhandhā apacayaṁ gacchanti. Taṇhā cassa ponobhavikā
nandirāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī sā cassa pahīyati. Tassa kāyikāpi
darathā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi darathā pahīyanti, kāyikāpi santāpā pahīyanti,
cetasikāpi santāpā pahīyanti, kāyikāpi pariḷāhā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi pariḷāhā
pahīyanti. So kāyasukhampi cetosukhampi paṭisaṁvedeti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1033-1"><a href="#fn-fn1033">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, knowing and seeing the eye as it actually is, knowing and seeing forms
as they actually are, knowing and seeing eye-consciousness as it actually is,
knowing and seeing eye-contact as it actually is, whatever is felt, pleasant
or unpleasant or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising in dependence on
eye-contact, knowing and seeing that too as it actually is, one does not get
lustfully attached to the eye, to forms, to eye-consciousness, to eye-contact,
and to whatever is felt as pleasant or unpleasant or
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising in dependence on eye-contact.</p>
<p>And for him, who is not lustfully attached, not fettered, not infatuated,
contemplating danger, the five aggregates of grasping get diminished for the
future and his craving, which makes for re-becoming, which is accompanied by
delight and lust, delighting now here now there, is abandoned, his bodily
stresses are abandoned, his mental stresses are abandoned, his bodily torments
are abandoned, his mental torments are abandoned, his bodily fevers are
abandoned, his mental fevers are abandoned, and he experiences bodily and
mental happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha goes on to point out how the noble eightfold path gets developed
in this noble disciple by this training in regard to the six spheres of sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā tathābhūtassa diṭṭhi sāssa hoti sammā diṭṭhi, yo tathābhūtassa saṅkappo
svāssa hoti sammā saṅkappo, yo tathābhūtassa vāyāmo svāssa hoti sammā vāyāmo,
yā tathābhūtassa sati sāssa hoti sammā sati, yo tathābhūtassa samādhi svāssa
hoti sammā samādhi, Pubbeva kho panassa kāyakammaṁ vacīkammaṁ ājīvo
suparisuddho hoti. Evamassāyaṁ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvanāpāripūriṁ
gacchati.</em></p>
<p>The view of a person such as this is right view. The intention of a person
such as this is right intention. The effort of a person such as this is right
effort. The mindfulness of a person such as this is right mindfulness. The
concentration of a person such as this is right concentration. But his bodily
action, his verbal action and his livelihood have already been purified
earlier. Thus this noble eightfold path comes to fulfilment in him by
development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that in this context the usual order in citing the factors of
the path is not found. But at the end we are told that bodily action, verbal
action and livelihood have already been purified.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the explanation given in the <em>Mahācattārīsakasutta</em>, in
the previous sermon. That is to say, when the noble eightfold path is perfected
at the supramundane level, the three factors right speech, right action and
right livelihood are represented by the very thought of abstaining.</p>
<p>Now the Buddha proclaims how all the enlightenment factors reach fulfilment by
development when one develops the noble eightfold path in this way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassa evaṁ imaṁ ariyaṁ aṭṭhaṅgikaṁ maggaṁ bhāvayato cattāropi satipaṭṭhānā
bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, cattāropi sammappadhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ
gacchanti, cattāropi iddhipādā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, pañcapi indriyāni
bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, pañcapi balāni bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, sattapi
bojjhaṅgā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti. Tass’ime dve dhammā yuganaddhā vattanti,
samatho ca vipassanā ca.</em></p>
<p>When he develops this noble eightfold path in this way, the four foundations
of mindfulness also come to fulfilment by development, the four right
endeavours also come to fulfilment by development, the four bases for success
also come to fulfilment by development, the five faculties also come to
fulfilment by development, the five powers also come to fulfilment by
development and the seven factors of enlightenment also come to fulfilment by
development. These two things, namely serenity and insight, occur in him yoked
evenly together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The net result of perfecting all the enlightenment factors is summed up by the
Buddha in the following declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So ye dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā te dhamme abhiññā parijānāti, ye dhammā
abhiññā pahātabbā te dhamme abhiññā pajahati, ye dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā te
dhamme abhiññā bhāveti, ye dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā te dhamme abhiññā
sacchikaroti.</em></p>
<p>He comprehends by direct knowledge those things that should be comprehended by
direct knowledge, he abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be
abandoned by direct knowledge, he develops by direct knowledge those things
that should be developed by direct knowledge, he realizes by direct knowledge
those things that should be realized by direct knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The things that should be comprehended by direct knowledge are explained in the
sutta itself as the five aggregates of grasping. The things that should be
abandoned by direct knowledge are ignorance and craving. The things that should
be developed by direct knowledge are serenity and insight. The things that
should be realized by direct knowledge are true knowledge and deliverance.</p>
<p>So then, as we have already mentioned, the orderly arrangement in these
thirty-seven enlightenment factors is well illustrated in this discourse. It is
because of this orderliness that even in a stream-winner, who is well
established in the noble eightfold path, other enlightenment factors are said to
be present as if automatically.</p>
<p>Simply because the phrase <em>ekāyano ayaṁ, bhikkhave, maggo</em> occurs in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, some are tempted to interpret the four foundations of
mindfulness as ‘the only way’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1034-1"><a href="#fn-fn1034">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We have pointed out, with valid reasons on an earlier occasion, that such a
conclusion is unwarranted. <em>Ekāyano</em> does not mean ‘the only way’, it means
‘directed to one particular destination’, that is, to Nibbāna. That is why the
following words occur later on in the same sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ñāyassa adhigamāya Nibbānassa sacchikiriyāya</em>,</p>
<p>for the attainment of the supramundane path, for the realizing of Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four foundations of mindfulness are the preliminary training for the
attainment of the supramundane path and realization of Nibbāna. The initial
start made by the four foundations of mindfulness is carried over by the four
right endeavours, the four bases for success, the five faculties, the five
powers and the seven enlightenment factors, to reach the acme of perfection in
the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> we came across the repetitive phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ</em></p>
<p>knowing and seeing as it actually is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used in connection with the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact and
whatever is felt due to eye-contact. Let us examine what this knowing and seeing
as it actually is amounts to.</p>
<p>Perception has been compared to a mirage.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1035-1"><a href="#fn-fn1035">4</a></sup> This mirage nature of
perception has to be understood. A deer which sees a mirage in a plain from a
distance in the dry season has a perception of water in it. In other words, it
imagines water in the mirage. Impelled by that imagining, it runs towards the
mirage with the idea that by running it can do away with the gap between itself
and the water, and reach that water.</p>
<p>But there is something that the deer is not aware of, and that is that this gap
can never be reduced by running.</p>
<p>So long as there are two ends, there is a middle. This is a maxim worth
emphasizing. Where there are two ends, there is a middle. If the eye is
distinguished as one end and what appears in the distance is distinguished as
water, there is an intervening space, a gap between the two. All these three
factors are integral in this perceptual situation. That is why the gap can never
be done away with.</p>
<p>The emancipated one, who has understood that this can never be eliminated, does
not run after the mirage. That one with discernment, that <em>arahant</em>, stops short
at the seen, true to the aphorism <em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ</em>, “in the seen just the
seen”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1036-1"><a href="#fn-fn1036">5</a></sup></p>
<p>He stops at the heard in the heard, he stops at the sensed in the sensed, he
stops at the cognized in the cognized. He does not go on imagining like that
deer, taking his stand on perception. He does not imagine a thing seen or one
who sees. Nor does he entertain imaginings in regard to the heard, the sensed
and the cognized.</p>
<p>The fact that this freedom from imaginings is there in an <em>arahant</em> is clear
from the statement we quoted from the <em>Chabbisodhanasutta</em> on an earlier
occasion. According to that discourse, a monk rightly claiming <em>arahanthood</em>,
one who declares himself to be an <em>arahant</em>, should be able to make the
following statement in respect of the seen, the heard, the sensed and the
cognized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhe kho ahaṁ, āvuso, anupāyo anapāyo anissito appaṭibaddho vippamutto
visaṁyutto vimariyādikatena cetasā viharāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1037-1"><a href="#fn-fn1037">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Friends, with regard to the seen, I dwell unattracted, unrepelled,
independent, uninvolved, released, unshackled, with a mind free from barriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let us try to understand this statement in the light of what we have already
said about the mirage. One can neither approach nor retreat from a mirage.
Generally, when one sees a mirage in the dry season, one imagines a perception
of water in it and runs towards it due to thirst.</p>
<p>But let us, for a moment, think that on seeing the mirage one becomes
apprehensive of a flood and turns and runs away to escape it. Having run some
far, if he looks back he will still see the mirage behind him.</p>
<p>So in the case of a mirage, the more one approaches it, the farther it recedes,
the more one recedes from it, the nearer it appears. So in regard to the mirage
of percepts, such as the seen and the heard, the <em>arahant</em> neither approaches
nor recedes. Mentally he neither approaches nor recedes, though he may appear to
do both physically, from the point of view of the worldling – <em>anupāyo anapāyo</em>,
unattracted, unrepelled.</p>
<p>It is the same with regard to the term <em>anissito</em>, independent. He does not
resort to the mirage with the thought “Ah, here is a good reservoir”.</p>
<p><em>Appaṭibaddho</em>, uninvolved, he is not mentally involved in the mirage.</p>
<p><em>Vippamutto</em>, released, he is released from the perception of water in the
mirage, from imagining water in it.</p>
<p><em>Visaṁyutto,</em> unshackled, he is not bound by it.</p>
<p><em>Vimariyādikatena cetasā</em>, with a mind free from barriers. What are these
barriers? The two ends and the middle. The demarcation mentioned above by
distinguishing eye as distinct from form, with the intervening space or the gap
as the ‘tertium quid’. So for the <em>arahant</em> there are no barriers by taking the
eye, the forms and the gap as discrete.</p>
<p>Now from what we have already discussed, it should be clear that by <em>maññanā</em> or
imagining a thing-hood is attributed to the seen, the heard, the sensed and the
cognized. One imagines a thing in the seen, heard etc. By that very imagining as
a thing it becomes another thing, true to the dictum expressed in the line of
that verse from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> we had quoted earlier,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yena yena hi maññanti, tato taṁ hoti aññāthā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1038-1"><a href="#fn-fn1038">7</a></sup></p>
<p>in whatever egoistic terms they imagine, thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why we earlier said that a thing has to be there first for it to become
another thing, for there to be an otherwiseness. The more one tries to approach
the thing imagined, the more it recedes.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, we discussed at length about the
three levels of knowledge mentioned there, namely <em>saññā, abhiññā</em> and
<em>pariññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1039-1"><a href="#fn-fn1039">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The untaught worldling is bound by sense-perception and goes on imagining
according to it. Perceiving earth in the earth element, he imagines ‘earth’ as a
thing, he imagines ‘in the earth’, ‘earth is mine’, ‘from the earth’ etc. So
also with regard to the seen, <em>diṭṭha</em>.</p>
<p>But the disciple in training, <em>sekha</em>, since he has a higher knowledge of
conditionality, although he has not exhausted the influxes and latencies, trains
in resisting from the tendency to imagine. An emancipated one, the <em>arahant</em>,
has fully comprehended the mirage nature of perception.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that these forms of <em>maññanā</em> enable one to imagine things,
attributing a notion of substantiality to sense data. In fact, what we have here
is only a heap of imaginings. There is also an attempt to hold on to things
imagined. Craving lends a hand to it, and so there is grasping, <em>upādāna</em>.
Thereby the fact that there are three conditions is ignored or forgotten.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> we came across a highly significant
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1040-1"><a href="#fn-fn1040">9</a></sup></p>
<p>dependent on the eye and forms, friends, arises eye-consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deepest point in sense perception is already implicit there. This statement
clearly indicates that eye-consciousness is dependently arisen. Thereby we are
confronted with the question of the two ends and the middle, discussed above.</p>
<p>In fact, what is called eye-consciousness is the very discrimination between eye
and form. At whatever moment the eye is distinguished as the internal sphere and
form is distinguished as the external sphere, it is then that eye-consciousness
arises. That itself is the gap in the middle, the intervening space. Here, then,
we have the two ends and the middle.</p>
<p>To facilitate understanding this situation, let us hark back to the simile of
the carpenter we brought up in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1041-1"><a href="#fn-fn1041">10</a></sup></p>
<p>We mentioned that a carpenter, fixing up a door by joining two planks, might
speak of the contact between the two planks when his attention is turned to the
intervening space, to see how well one plank touches the other. The concept of
touching between the two planks came up because the carpenter’s attention picked
up the two planks as separate and not as one board.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is implicit in the statement <em>cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca
uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ</em>, “dependent on eye and forms arises
eye-consciousness”. In this perceptual situation, the eye is distinguished from
forms. That discrimination itself is consciousness. That is the gap or the
interstice, the middle. So here we have the two ends and the middle.</p>
<p>Eye-contact, from the point of view of Dhamma, is an extremely complex
situation. As a matter of fact, it is something that has two ends and a middle.
The two ends and the middle belong to it. However, there is a tendency in the
world to ignore this middle.</p>
<p>The attempt to tie up the two ends by ignoring the middle is <em>upādāna</em> or
grasping. That is impelled by craving, <em>taṇhā</em>. Due to craving, grasping occurs
as a matter of course. It is as if the deer, thinking “I am here and the water
is there, so let me get closer”, starts running towards it. The gap is ignored.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens in the case of sense perception. What impels one to
ignore that gap is craving. It is sometimes called <em>lepa</em> or glue. With that
agglutinative quality in craving the gap is continually sought to be glued up
and ignored.</p>
<p>The Buddha has compared craving to a seamstress. The verb <em>sibbati</em> or
<em>saṁsibbati</em> is used to convey the idea of sewing and weaving both. In sewing as
well as in weaving, there is an attempt to reduce a gap by stitching up or
knitting up. What is called <em>upādāna</em>, grasping or holding on, is an attempt to
tie up two ends with the help of <em>taṇhā</em>, craving or thirst.</p>
<p>In the <em>Tissametteyyasutta</em> of the <em>Pārāyaṇavagga</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, the
Buddha shows how one can bypass this seamstress or weaver that is craving and
attain emancipation in the following extremely deep verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo ubh’ anta-m-abhiññāya</em> <br />
<em>majjhe mantā na lippati,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ brūmi mahāpuriso’ti</em> <br />
<em>so ’dha sibbanim accagā.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1042-1"><a href="#fn-fn1042">11</a></sup></p>
<p>He who, having known both ends, <br />
With wisdom does not get attached to the middle, <br />
Him I call a great man, <br />
He has gone beyond the seamstress in this [world].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse is so deep and meaningful that already during the lifetime of the
Buddha, when he was dwelling at Isipatana in Benares, a group of Elder Monks
gathered at the assembly hall and held a symposium on the meaning of this verse.</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time, unlike today, for deep discussions on Dhamma, they took up
such deep topics as found in the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> and <em>Pārāyaṇavagga</em> of the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. In this case, the topic that came up for discussion, as recorded
among the Sixes in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamo nu kho, āvuso, eko anto, katamo dutiyo anto, kiṁ majjhe, kā
sibbani?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1043-1"><a href="#fn-fn1043">12</a></sup></p>
<p>What, friends, is the one end, what is the second end, what is in the middle
and who is the seamstress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first venerable Thera, who addressed the assembly of monks on this topic,
offered the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contact, friends, is one end, arising of contact is the second end, cessation
of contact is in the middle, craving is the seamstress, for it is craving that
stitches up for the birth of this and that specific existence.</p>
<p>In so far, friends, does a monk understand by higher knowledge what is to be
understood by higher knowledge, comprehend by full understanding what is to be
comprehended by full understanding. Understanding by higher knowledge what is
to be understood by higher knowledge, comprehending by full understanding what
is to be comprehended by full understanding, he becomes an ender of suffering
in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craving, according to this interpretation, is a seamstress, because it is
craving that puts the stitch for existence.</p>
<p>Then a second venerable Thera puts forth his opinion. According to his point of
view, the past is one end, the future is the second end, the present is the
middle, craving is the seamstress.</p>
<p>A third venerable Thera offered his interpretation. For him, one end is pleasant
feeling, the second end is unpleasant or painful feeling, and the middle is
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling. Craving is again the seamstress.</p>
<p>A fourth venerable Thera opines that the one end is name, the second end is
form, the middle is consciousness and the seamstress is craving.</p>
<p>A fifth venerable Thera puts forward the view that the one end is the six
internal sense-spheres, the second end is the six external sense-spheres,
consciousness is the middle and craving is the seamstress.</p>
<p>A sixth venerable Thera is of the opinion that the one end is <em>sakkāya</em>, a term
for the five aggregates of grasping, literally the ‘existing body’. The second
end, according to him, is the arising of <em>sakkāya</em>. The middle is the cessation
of <em>sakkāya</em>. As before, the seamstress is craving.</p>
<p>When six explanations had come up before the symposium, one monk suggested,
somewhat like a point of order, that since six different interpretations have
come up, it would be best to approach the teacher, the Fortunate One, and report
the discussion for clarification and correct judgement.</p>
<p>Approving that suggestion, they all went to the Buddha and asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kassa nu kho, bhante, subhāsitaṁ?</em></p>
<p>Venerable sir, whose words are well spoken?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what you all have said is well said from some point of view or other.
But that for which I preached that verse in the <em>Metteyyapañha</em> is this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quoting the verse in question the Buddha explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, contact is one end, the arising of contact is the second end, the
cessation of contact is in the middle, craving is the seamstress, for it is
craving that puts the stitch for the birth of this or that existence.</p>
<p>In so far, monks, does a monk understand by higher knowledge what is to be
understood by higher knowledge, and comprehend by full understanding what is
to be comprehended by full understanding. Understanding by higher knowledge
what is to be understood by higher knowledge, and comprehending by full
understanding what is to be comprehended by full understanding, he becomes an
ender of suffering in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s explanation happens to coincide with the interpretation given by
the first speaker at the symposium. However, since he ratifies all the six
interpretations as well said, we can see how profound and at the same time broad
the meaning of this cryptic verse is.</p>
<p>Let us now try to understand these six explanations. One can make use of these
six as meditation topics. The verse has a pragmatic value and so also the
explanations given. What is the business of this seamstress or weaver?</p>
<p>According to the first interpretation, craving stitches up the first end,
contact, with the second end, the arising of contact, ignoring the middle, the
cessation of contact. It is beneath this middle, the cessation of contact, that
ignorance lurks.</p>
<p>As the line implies: <em>majjhe mantā na lippati</em>, “with wisdom does not get
attached to the middle”, when what is in the middle is understood, there is
emancipation. One is released from craving. So our special attention should be
directed to what lies in the middle, the cessation of contact.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Therefore, according to the first interpretation, the seamstress, craving,
stitches up contact and the arising of contact, ignoring the cessation of
contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the second interpretation, the past and the future are stitched up, ignoring the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third interpretation takes it as a stitching up of unpleasant feeling and
pleasant feeling, ignoring the neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth interpretation speaks of stitching up name and form, ignoring consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the fifth interpretation, it is a case of stitching up the six internal
sense-spheres with the six external sense-spheres, ignoring consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sixth interpretation, we are told of a stitching up of <em>sakkāya</em>, or
‘existing-body’, with the arising of the existing-body, ignoring the
cessation of the existing-body.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We mentioned above that in sewing as well as in weaving there is an attempt to
reduce a gap by stitching up or knitting up. These interpretations show us that
ignoring the middle is a common trait in the worldling. It is there that
ignorance lurks. If one rightly understands this middle dispassion sets in,
leading to disenchantment, relinquishment and deliverance.</p>
<p>Let us now turn our attention to a few parallel discourses that throw some light
on the depth of these meditation topics. We come across two verses in the
<em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which are relevant to the first
interpretation, namely that which concerns contact, the arising of contact and
the cessation of contact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sukhaṁ vā yadi va dukkhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>adukkhamasukhaṁ sahā,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattañ ca bahiddhā ca</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ kiñci atthi veditaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ ’dukkhan’ti ñatvāna,</em></p>
<p><em>mosadhammaṁ palokinaṁ</em>, <br />
<em>phussa phussa vayaṁ passaṁ</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ tattha virajjati,</em> <br />
<em>vedanānaṁ khayā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nicchāto parinibbuto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1044-1"><a href="#fn-fn1044">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Be it pleasant or unpleasant, <br />
Or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, <br />
Inwardly or outwardly, <br />
All what is felt, <br />
Knowing it as ‘pain’,</p>
<p>Delusive and brittle, <br />
Touch after touch, seeing how it wanes, <br />
That way he grows dispassionate therein, <br />
By the extinction of feeling it is <br />
That a monk becomes hungerless and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following two lines are particularly significant, as they are relevant to
the knowledge of ‘breaking up’ in the development of insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>phussa phussa vayaṁ passaṁ</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ tattha virajjati.</em></p>
<p>Touch after touch, seeing how it wanes, <br />
that way he grows dispassionate therein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems, therefore, that generally the cessation of contact is ignored or
slurred over by the worldling’s mind, busy with the arising aspect. Therefore
the seeing of cessation comes only with the insight knowledge of seeing the
breaking up, <em>bhaṅgañāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>As an illustration in support of the second interpretation we may quote the
following verses from the <em>Bhaddekarattasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atītaṁ nānvāgameyya,</em> <br />
<em>nappaṭikaṅkhe anāgataṁ</em> <br />
<em>yad atītaṁ pahīnaṁ taṁ</em> <br />
<em>appattañ ca anāgataṁ.</em> <br />
<em>Paccuppannañ ca yo dhammaṁ</em> <br />
<em>tattha tattha vipassati,</em> <br />
<em>asaṁhīraṁ asaṁkuppaṁ</em> <br />
<em>taṁ vidvā-m-anubrūhaye.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1045-1"><a href="#fn-fn1045">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Let one not trace back whatever is past, <br />
Nor keep on hankering for the not yet come, <br />
Whatever is past is gone for good, <br />
That which is future is yet to come. <br />
But [whoever] sees that which rises up, <br />
As now with insight as and when it comes, <br />
Neither ‘drawing in’ nor ‘pushing on’, <br />
That kind of stage should the wise cultivate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the reflection on preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, in deep insight meditation, it is
the present preparations that are presented to reflection. That is why we find
the apparently unusual order <em>atīta – anāgata – paccuppanna</em>, ‘past – future –
present’, mentioned everywhere in the discourses.</p>
<p>To reflect on past preparations is relatively easy, so also are the future
preparations. It is the present preparations that are elusive and difficult to
muster. But in deep insight meditation the attention should be on the present
preparations. So much is enough for the second interpretation.</p>
<p>The third interpretation has to do with the three grades of feeling, the
pleasant, unpleasant and the neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant. About these we
have already discussed at length, on an earlier occasion, in connection with the
long dialogue between the Venerable <em>arahant</em> nun Dhammadinnā and the lay
disciple Visākha on the question of those three grades of feeling. Suffice it
for the present to cite the following relevant sections of that dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sukhāya vedanāya dukkhā vedanā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>dukkhāya vedanāya sukhā vedanā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>avijjāya vijjā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>vijjāya vimutti paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>vimuttiyā Nibbānaṁ paṭibhāgo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1046-1"><a href="#fn-fn1046">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Unpleasant feeling is the counterpart of pleasant feeling … <br />
pleasant feeling is the counterpart of unpleasant feeling … <br />
ignorance is the counterpart of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling … <br />
knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance … <br />
deliverance is the counterpart of knowledge … <br />
Nibbāna is the counterpart of deliverance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The counterpart or the ‘other half’ of pleasant feeling is unpleasant feeling.
The counterpart of unpleasant feeling is pleasant feeling. Between these two
there is a circularity in relationship, a seesawing. There is no way out.</p>
<p>But there is in the middle neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling. The
counterpart of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling is ignorance. So we see
how the neutrality and indifference of equanimity has beneath it ignorance.</p>
<p>But luckily there is the good side in this pair of counterparts. Deliverance
lies that way, for knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance. When ignorance is
displaced, knowledge surfaces. From knowledge comes deliverance, and from
deliverance Nibbāna or extinction. This much is enough for the third
interpretation.</p>
<p>Now for the fourth interpretation. Here we have consciousness between name-and-form. Let us remind ourselves of the two verses quoted in an earlier sermon from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpūpagā sattā</em> <br />
<em>ye ca arūpaṭṭhāyino,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhaṁ appajānantā</em> <br />
<em>āgantāro punabbhavaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpe pariññāya,</em> <br />
<em>arūpesu asaṇṭhitā,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhe ye vimuccanti,</em> <br />
<em>te janā maccuhāyino.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1047-1"><a href="#fn-fn1047">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Those beings that go to realms of form, <br />
And those who are settled in formless realms, <br />
Not understanding the fact of cessation, <br />
Come back again and again to existence.</p>
<p>Those who, having comprehended realms of form, <br />
Do not settle in formless realms, <br />
Are released in the experience of cessation, <br />
It is they that are the dispellers of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cessation here referred to is the cessation of consciousness, or the
cessation of becoming. Such emancipated ones are called ‘dispellers of death’,
<em>maccuhāyino</em>.</p>
<p>We have mentioned earlier that, before the advent of the Buddha and even
afterwards, sages like Āḷāra Kālāma tried to escape form, <em>rūpa</em>, by grasping
the formless, <em>arūpa</em>. But only the Buddha could point out that one cannot win
release from form by resorting to the formless. Release from both should be the
aim.</p>
<p>How could that come about? By the cessation of consciousness which discriminates
between form and formless. It is tantamount to the cessation of existence,
<em>bhavanirodha</em>.</p>
<p>As a little hint to understand this deep point, we may allude to that simile of
the dog on the plank across the stream which we brought up several times. Why
does that dog keep on looking at the dog it sees in the water, its own
reflection? Because it is unaware of the reflexive quality of the water.</p>
<p>Consciousness is like that water which has the quality of reflecting on its
surface. What is there between the <strong>seen</strong> dog and the <strong>looking</strong> dog as the
middle is consciousness itself. One can therefore understand why consciousness
is said to be in the middle between name and form.</p>
<p>Generally, in the traditional analysis of the relation between name-and-form and
consciousness, this fact is overlooked. True to the simile of the magical
illusion, given to consciousness, its middle position between name and form is
difficult for one to understand. Had the dog understood the reflective quality
of water, it would not halt on that plank to gaze down and growl.</p>
<p>The fifth interpretation puts the six internal sense-spheres and the six
external sense-spheres on either side, to have consciousness in the middle. A
brief explanation would suffice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvayaṁ, bhikkhave, paṭicca viññāṇaṁ sambhoti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1048-1"><a href="#fn-fn1048">17</a></sup></p>
<p>monks, dependent on a dyad consciousness arises,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… says the Buddha. That is to say, dependent on internal and external
sense-spheres consciousness arises. As we have already pointed out,
consciousness is the very discrimination between the two. Therefore
consciousness is the middle.</p>
<p>So at the moment when one understands consciousness, one realizes that the fault
lies in this discrimination itself. The farther limit of the internal is the
nearer limit of the external. One understands then that the gap, the interstice
between them, is something imagined.</p>
<p>Then as to the sixth interpretation, we have the <em>sakkāya</em>, the ‘existing body’,
and <em>sakkāyasamudaya</em>, the arising of the existing body, as the two ends.</p>
<p>Because the term <em>sakkāya</em> is not often met with, it might be difficult to
understand what it means. To be brief, the Buddha has defined the term as
referring to the five aggregates of grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1049-1"><a href="#fn-fn1049">18</a></sup> Its derivation, <em>sat +
kāya</em>, indicates that the term is suggestive of the tendency to take the whole
group as existing, giving way to the perception of the compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>.</p>
<p>The arising of this notion of an existing body is <em>chandarāga</em> or desire and
lust. It is due to desire or craving that one grasps a heap as a compact whole.
The cessation of the existing body is the abandonment of desire and lust. This,
then, is a summary of the salient points in these six interpretations as
meditation topics for realization.</p>
<p>Let us now turn our attention to the sewing and weaving spoken of here. We have
mentioned above that both in sewing and weaving a knotting comes in, as a way of
reducing the gap. This knotting involves some kind of attracting, binding and
entangling. In the case of a sewing machine, every time the needle goes down,
the shuttle hastens to put a knot for the stitch. So long as this attraction
continues, the stitching goes on.</p>
<p>There is some relation between sewing and weaving. Sewing is an attempt to put
together two folds. In weaving a single thread of cotton or wool is looped into
two folds. In both there is a formation of knots. As already mentioned, knots
are formed by some sort of attraction, binding and entangling.</p>
<p>Now craving is the seamstress who puts the stitches to this existence, <em>bhava</em>.
She has a long line of qualifications for it. <em>Ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā
tatratatrābhinandinī</em> are some of the epithets for craving.</p>
<p>She is the perpetrator in re-becoming or renewed existence, <em>ponobhavikā</em>,
bringing about birth after birth. She has a trait of delighting and lusting,
<em>nandirāgasahagatā</em>. Notoriously licentious she delights now here now there,
<em>tatratatrābhinandinī</em>. Like that seamstress, craving puts the stitches into
existence, even as the needle and the shuttle.</p>
<p>Craving draws in with <em>upādāna</em>, grasping, while conceit binds and views
complete the entanglement. That is how existence gets stitched up.</p>
<p>At whatever moment the shuttle runs out of its load of cotton, the apparent
stitches do not result in a seam. Similarly, in a weaving, if instead of drawing
in the thread to complete the knot it is drawn out, all what is woven will be
undone immediately. This is the difference between existence and its cessation.
Existence is a formation of knots and stress. Cessation is an unravelling of
knots and rest.</p>
<p><strong>Existence is a formation of knots and stress. Cessation is an unravelling of
knots and rest.</strong></p>
<p>The following verse in the <em>Suddhaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> seems to
put in a nutshell the philosophy behind the simile of the seamstress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na kappayanti na purekkharonti</em> <br />
<em>‘accantasuddhī’ ti na te vadanti,</em> <br />
<em>ādānaganthaṁ gathitaṁ visajja,</em> <br />
<em>āsaṁ na kubbanti kuhiñci loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1050-1"><a href="#fn-fn1050">19</a></sup></p>
<p>They fabricate not, they proffer not, <br />
Nor do they speak of a ‘highest purity’, <br />
Unravelling the tangled knot of grasping, <br />
They form no desire anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comments we have presented here, based on the verse beginning with <em>yo ubh’
anta-m-abhiññāya</em> could even be offered as a synopsis of the entire series of
thirty-three sermons.</p>
<p>All what we brought up in these sermons concerns the question of the two ends
and the middle. The episode of the two ends and the middle enshrines a profound
insight into the law of dependent arising and the Buddha’s teachings on the
middle path. That is why we said that the verse in question is both profound and
broad, as far as its meaning is concerned.</p>
<p>So now that we have presented this synoptic verse, we propose to wind up this
series of sermons.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the reason for many a misconception about Nibbāna is a lack
of understanding the law of dependent arising and the middle path. For the same
reason, true to the Buddha’s description of beings as taking delight in
existence, <em>bhavarāmā</em>, lusting for existence, <em>bhavaratā</em>, and rejoicing in
existence, <em>bhavasammuditā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1051-1"><a href="#fn-fn1051">20</a></sup> Nibbāna came to be apprehensively
misconstrued as tantamount to annihilation.</p>
<p>Therefore even commentators were scared of the prospect of a cessation of
existence and tried to explain away Nibbāna through definitions that serve to
perpetuate craving for existence.</p>
<p>If by this attempt of ours to clear the path to Nibbāna, overgrown as it is
through neglect for many centuries, due to various social upheavals, any store
of merit accrued to us, may it duly go to our most venerable Great Preceptor,
who so magnanimously made the invitation to deliver this series of sermons. As
he is staying away for medical treatment at this moment, aged and ailing, let us
wish him quick recovery and long life. May all his Dhamma aspirations be
fulfilled!</p>
<p>May the devoted efforts in meditation of all those fellow dwellers in this holy
life, who listened to these sermons and taped them for the benefit of those who
would like to lend ear to them, be rewarded with success! Let a myriad <em>arahant</em>
lotuses, unsmeared by water and mud, bright petalled and sweet scented, bloom
all over the forest hermitage pond. May the merits accrued by giving these
sermons be shared by my departed parents, who brought me up, my teachers, who
gave me vision, and my friends, relatives and lay supporters, who helped keep
this frail body alive. May they all attain the bliss of Nibbāna!</p>
<p>May all gods and Brahmās and all beings rejoice in the merits accrued by these
sermons! May it conduce to the attainment of that peaceful and excellent
Nibbāna! May the dispensation of the Fully Enlightened One endure long in this
world! Let this garland of well preached Dhamma words be a humble offering at
the foot of the Dhamma shrine, which received honour and worship even from the
Buddha himself.</p>
