<p>Venerable Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda was born in 1940 to a family of Buddhist parents
in Galle, Sri Lanka. He received his school education at Mahinda College, Galle,
where he imbibed the true Buddhist values. In 1962 he graduated from the
University of Peradeniya and served as an Assistant Lecturer in Pāli at the same
University for a brief period. He renounced his post in 1967 to enter the Order
of Buddhist monks at Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa.</p>
<p>Already during the first phase of his life as a monk at Island Hermitage, Ven.
Ñāṇananda had written four books which were published by the Buddhist
Publication Society in Kandy under the titles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought</li>
<li>Saṁyutta Nikāya – An Anthology (Part II)</li>
<li>Ideal Solitude</li>
<li>The Magic of the Mind</li>
</ol>
<p>Then in 1972 he left Island Hermitage for Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya, where he
came under the tutelage of the late Ven. Mātara Sri Ñāṇārāma Mahāthera, a
veteran teacher of Insight Meditation. The association of these two eminent
disciples of the Buddha in a teacher-pupil relationship for about two decades,
heralded a new era in the propagation of Dhamma through instructive books on
Buddhist Meditation.</p>
<p>The signal contribution of this long association, however, was the set of 33
sermons on Nibbāna delivered by Ven. Ñāṇananda to his fellow resident monks at
the invitation of the venerable Ñāṇārāma Mahāthera, during the period from
August 1988 to January 1991. Inspired by these sermons, a group of lay
enthusiasts initiated a Dhamma Publication Trust (D.G.M.B.) at the Public
Trustee’s Department to bring out the sermons in book form. The noble Dhammadāna
aspiration of Ven. Ñāṇananda to give all books free to the readers provided an
opportunity to the Buddhist public to contribute towards the publication of his
books. This remarkable step had a spiritual dimension in reaffirming the age-old
Buddhist values attached to Dhamamadāna, fast eroding before the hungry waves of
commercialization. It has proved its worth by creating a healthy cultural
atmosphere in which the readers shared the Dhamma-gift with others, thus
moulding the links of salutary friendship (<em>Kalyāna mittatā</em>) indispensable for
the continuity of the Buddha Sāsana.</p>
<p>We are already convinced of the immense potentialities of this magnanimous
venture, having witnessed the extraordinary response of the Buddhist public in
sending their contributions to the Trust to enable the publication of books.
Though usually the names of donors are shown at the end of each publication,
some donations – even sizeable ones – are conspicuous by their anonymity. This
exemplary trait is symbolic of the implicit confidence of the donor in the
Trust.</p>
<p>Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda Sadaham Senasun Bhāraya (K.N.S.S.B) is bearing the burden
of publication of Ven. Ñāṇananda’s sermons and writings, while making available
this Dhammadāna to a wider global audience through the new electronic
technology. Recorded sermons on CDs are also being issued free as Dhammadāna by
this Trust, while making available this Dhamma gift free through the internet.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Nibbāna – the ultimate goal of the Buddhist, has been variously understood
and interpreted in the history of Buddhist thought. One who earnestly takes up
the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path for the attainment of this goal, might
sometimes be dismayed to find this medley of views confronting him. Right View,
as the first factor of that path, has always to be in the vanguard in one’s
practice. In the interests of this Right View, which one has to progressively
‘straighten-up’, a need for clarification before purification might sometimes be
strongly felt. It was in such a context that the present series of 33 sermons on
Nibbāna came to be delivered.</p>
<p>The invitation for this series of sermons came from my revered teacher, the late
Venerable Mātara Sri Ñāṇārāma Mahāthera, who was the resident meditation teacher
of Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya Meditation Centre. Under his inspiring patronage
these sermons were delivered once every fortnight before the group of resident
monks of Nissarana Vanaya, during the period from
the New Moon uposatha of 1988 Aug. 12th
to the Full Moon uposatha of 1991 Jan. 30th.</p>
<p>The sermons, which were originally circulated on cassettes, began issuing in
book-form only in 1997, when the first volume of the Sinhala series titled
<em>Nivane Niveema</em> came out, published by the <em>Dharma Grantha Mudrana Bhāraya</em>
(Dhamma Publications Trust) setup for the purpose in the Department of the
Public Trustee, Sri Lanka. The series is scheduled to comprise 11 volumes, of
which so far 9 have come out. The entire series is for free distribution as
<em>Dhamma dāna</em> – ‘the gift of truth that excels all other gifts’. The sister
series to come out in English will comprise 7 volumes of 5 sermons each, which
will likewise be strictly for free distribution since Dhamma is price-less.</p>
<p>In these sermons I have attempted to trace the original meaning and significance
of the Pāli term Nibbāna (Skt. <em>Nirvāna</em>) based on the evidence from the
discourses of the Pāli Canon. This led to a detailed analysis and a re-appraisal
of some of the most controversial suttas on Nibbāna often quoted by scholars
in support of their interpretations. The findings, however, were not presented
as a dry scholastic exposition of mere academic interest. Since the sermons were
addressed to a meditative audience keen on <em>realizing Nibbāna</em>, edifying
similes, metaphors and illustrations had their place in the discussion. The
gamut of 33 sermons afforded sufficient scope for dealing with almost all the
salient teachings in Buddhism from a practical point of view.</p>
<p>The present translation, in so far as it is faithful to the original, will
reflect the same pragmatic outlook. While the findings could be of interest even
to the scholar bent on <em>theorizing on Nibbāna</em>, it is hoped that the mode of
presentation will have a special appeal for those who are keen on <em>realizing</em>
it.</p>
<p>I would like to follow up these few prefatory remarks with due acknowledgements
to all those who gave their help and encouragement for bringing out this
translation:</p>
<p>To Venerable Anālayo for transcribing the tape recorded
translations and the meticulous care and patience with which he
has provided references to the P.T.S. editions.</p>
<p>To Mr. U. Mapa, presently the Ambassador for Sri Lanka in Myanmar, for his
yeoman service in taking the necessary steps to establish the Dhamma
Publications Trust in his former capacity as the Public Trustee of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>To Mr. G.T. Bandara, Director, Royal Institute, 191, Havelock Road, Colombo 5,
for taking the lead in this Dhammadāna movement with his initial donation and
for his devoted services as the ‘Settler’ of the Trust.</p>
<p>And last but not least –</p>
<p>To, Mr. Hideo Chihashi, Director, Green Hill Meditation Institute, Tokyo, Japan,
and to his group of relatives, friends and pupils for their munificence in
sponsoring the publication of the first volume of <em>Nibbāna – The Mind Stilled</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>Recently we have had an occasion to listen to a series of sermons on Nibbāna
and there have been differences of opinion regarding the interpretation of some
deep suttas on Nibbāna in those sermons. And so the venerable Great
Preceptor suggested to me that it would be useful to this group if I would give
a set of sermons on Nibbāna, touching on those controversial points.</p>
<p>At first, for many reasons, I hesitated to accept this invitation for a serious
task, but then, as the venerable Great Preceptor repeatedly encouraged me on
this, I gave some thought as to how best I could set about doing it. And it
occurred to me that it would be best if I could address these sermons directly
to the task before us in this Nissarana Vanaya, and that is meditative
attention, rather than dealing with those deep controversial suttas in
academic isolation. And that is why I have selected the above quotation as the
theme for the entire set of sermons, hoping that it would help create the
correct atmosphere of meditative attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Etaṁ santaṁ etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo
taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This is peaceful, this is excellent, namely the stilling of all preparations,
the relinquishment of all assets, the destruction of craving, detachment,
cessation, extinction”.</p>
<p>This in fact is a meditation subject in itself, a <em>kammaṭṭhāna</em>. This is the
reflection on the peace of <em>Nibbāna, upasamānussati</em>. So if we can successfully
make use of this as both the heading and the theme of these sermons, we would be
in a position to understand those six qualities of the Dhamma. We are told
that the Dhamma is <em>svākkhāta</em>, that it is well-proclaimed, <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, can
be seen here and now, <em>akālika</em>, timeless, <em>ehipassika</em>, inviting one to come
and see, <em>opanayika</em>, leading one onwards, <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi</em>, that
it can be understood by the wise each one by himself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This set of sermons would have fulfilled its purpose if it drives home the true
significance of these six qualities of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>Now at the very outset I would like to say a few things by way of preparing the
background and I do hope that this assembly would bear with me for saying
certain things that I will be compelled to say in this concern. By way of
background something has to be said as to why there are so many complications
with regard to the meaning of some of the deep suttas on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>There is a popular belief that the commentaries are finally traceable to a
miscellany of the Buddha word scattered here and there, as <em>pakiṇṇakadesanā</em>.
But the true state of affairs seems to be rather different. Very often the
commentaries are unable to say something conclusive regarding the meaning of
deep suttas. So they simply give some possible interpretations and the reader
finds himself at a loss to choose the correct one. Sometimes the commentaries go
at a tangent and miss the correct interpretation. Why the commentaries are
silent on some deep suttas is also a problem to modern day scholars. There are
some historical reasons leading to this state of affairs in the commentaries.</p>
<p>In the <em>Āṇisutta</em> of the <em>Nidānavagga</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> we find the
Buddha making certain prophetic utterances regarding the dangers that will
befall the <em>Sāsana</em> in the future. It is said that in times to come, monks will
lose interest in those deep suttas which deal with matters transcendental,
that they would not listen to those suttas that have to do with the idea of
emptiness, <em>suññatā</em>. They would not think it even worthwhile learning or
pondering over the meanings of those suttas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye te suttantā tathāgatabhāsitā gambhīrā gambhīratthā lokuttarā
suññatappaṭisaṁyuttā, tesu bhaññamānesu na sussūssisanti na sotaṁ odahissanti
na aññā cittaṁ upaṭṭhāpessanti na te dhamme uggahetabbaṁ pariyāpuṇitabbaṁ
maññissanti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also another historical reason that can be adduced. An idea got deeply
rooted at a certain stage in the <em>Sāsana</em> history that what is contained in the
<em>Sutta Piṭaka</em> is simply the conventional teaching and so it came to imply that
there is nothing so deep in these suttas. This notion also had its share in
the present lack of interest in these suttas. According to <em>Manorathapūraṇī</em>,
the <em>Aṅguttara</em> commentary, already at an early stage in the <em>Sāsana</em> history of
Sri Lanka, there had been a debate between those who upheld the precept and
those who stood for realization.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> And it is said that those who upheld the
precept won the day. The final conclusion was that, for the continuity of the
<em>Sāsana</em>, precept itself is enough, not so much the realization.</p>
<p>Of course the efforts of the reciter monks of old for the preservation of the
precept in the midst of droughts and famines and other calamitous situations are
certainly praiseworthy. But the unfortunate thing about it was this: the basket
of the Buddha word came to be passed on from hand to hand in the dark, so much
so that there was the risk of some valuable things slipping out in the process.</p>
<p>Also there have been certain semantic developments in the commentarial period,
and this will be obvious to anyone searching for the genuine Dhamma. It seems
that there had been a tendency in the commentarial period to elaborate even on
some lucid words in the suttas, simply as a commentarial requirement, and this
led to the inclusion of many complicated ideas. By too much overdrawing in the
commentaries, the deeper meanings of the Dhamma got obscured. As a matter of
fact, the depth of the Dhamma has to be seen through lucidity, just as much as
one sees the bottom of a tank only when the water is lucid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dve nāma kiṁ?</em> <br />
<em>Nāmañca rūpañca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>“What is the ‘two’?” <br />
“Name and form.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second out of the ten questions Buddha had put to the Venerable
Sāmanera Sopāka who had attained <em>arahantship</em> at the age of seven. It is
like asking a child: “Can you count up to ten?” All the ten questions were deep,
the tenth being on <em>arahantship</em>. But of course Venerable Sopāka gave the
right answer each time. Now it is the second question and its answer that we are
concerned with here: <em>nāmañca rūpañca</em>. In fact, this is a basic teaching in
insight training.</p>
<p>It is obvious that <em>nāma</em> means ‘name’, and in the suttas also, <em>nāma</em>, when
used by itself, means ‘name’. However when we come to the commentaries we find
some kind of hesitation to recognize this obvious meaning. Even in the present
context, the commentary, <em>Paramatthajotikā</em>, explains the word ‘name’ so as to
mean ‘bending’. It says that all immaterial states are called <em>nāma</em>, in the
sense that they bend towards their respective objects and also because the mind
has the nature of inclination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ārammaṇābhimukhaṁ namanato, cittassa ca natihetuto sabbampi arūpaṁ ’nāman’ti
vuccati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn6">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the standard definition of <em>nāma</em> in <em>Abhidhamma</em> compendiums and
commentaries. The idea of bending towards an object is brought in to explain the
word <em>nāma</em>. It may be that they thought it too simple an interpretation to
explain <em>nāma</em> with reference to ‘name’, particularly because it is a term that
has to do with deep insight. However as far as the teachings in the suttas are
concerned, <em>nāma</em> still has a great depth even when it is understood in the
sense of ‘name’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāmaṁ sabbaṁ anvabhavi,</em> <br />
<em>nāmā bhiyyo na vijjati,</em> <br />
<em>nāmassa ekadhammassa,</em> <br />
<em>sabbeva vasamanvagū</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Name has conquered everything, <br />
There is nothing greater than name, <br />
All have gone under the sway <br />
Of this one thing called name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also there is another verse of the same type, but unfortunately its original
meaning is often ignored by the present day commentators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Akkheyyasaññino sattā,</em> <br />
<em>akkheyyasmiṁ patiṭṭhitā,</em> <br />
<em>akkheyyaṁ apariññāya,</em> <br />
<em>yogam āyanti maccuno</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Beings are conscious of what can be named, <br />
They are established on the nameable, <br />
By not comprehending the nameable things, <br />
They come under the yoke of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this shows that the word <em>nāma</em> has a deep significance even when it is
taken in the sense of ‘name’.</p>
<p>But now let us see whether there is something wrong in rendering <em>nāma</em> by
‘name’ in the case of the term <em>nāma-rūpa</em>. To begin with, let us turn to the
definition of <em>nāma-rūpa</em> as given by the Venerable Sāriputta in the
<em>Sammādiṭṭhisutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vedanā, saññā, cetanā, phasso, manasikāro – idaṁ vuccatāvuso, nāmaṁ</em>;
<em>cattāri ca mahābhūtāni, catunnañca mahābhūtānaṁ upādāyarūpaṁ – idaṁ
vuccatāvuso, rūpaṁ. Iti idañca nāmaṁ idañca rūpaṁ – idam vuccatāvuso
nāma-rūpaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Feeling, perception, intention, contact, attention – this, friend, is called
‘name’. The four great primaries and form dependent on the four great
primaries – this, friend, is called ‘form’. So this is ‘name’ and this is
‘form’ – this, friend, is called ‘name-and-form’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, this seems lucid enough as a definition but let us see, whether there is
any justification for regarding feeling, perception, intention, contact and
attention as ‘name’. Suppose there is a little child, a toddler, who is still
unable to speak or understand language. Someone gives him a rubber ball and the
child has seen it for the first time. If the child is told that it is a rubber
ball, he might not understand it. How does he get to know that object? He smells
it, feels it, and tries to eat it, and finally rolls it on the floor. At last he
understands that it is a plaything. Now the child has recognised the rubber ball
not by the name that the world has given it, but by those factors included under
‘name’ in <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, namely feeling, perception, intention, contact and
attention.</p>
<p>This shows that the definition of <em>nāma</em> in <em>nāma-rūpa</em> takes us back to the
most fundamental notion of ‘name’, to something like its prototype. The world
gives a name to an object for purposes of easy communication. When it gets the
sanction of others, it becomes a convention.</p>
<p>While commenting on the verse just quoted, the commentator also brings in a
bright idea. As an illustration of the sweeping power of name, he points out
that if any tree happens to have no name attached to it by the world, it would
at least be known as the ‘nameless tree’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn10">10</a></sup> Now as for the child, even such
a usage is not possible. So it gets to know an object by the aforesaid method.
And the factors involved there, are the most elementary constituents of name.</p>
<p>Now it is this elementary name-and-form world that a meditator also has to
understand, however much he may be conversant with the conventional world. But
if a meditator wants to understand this name-and-form world, he has to come back
to the state of a child, at least from one point of view. Of course in this case
the equanimity should be accompanied by knowledge and not by ignorance. And that
is why a meditator makes use of mindfulness and full awareness,
<em>satisampajañña</em>, in his attempt to understand name-and-form.</p>
<p>Even though he is able to recognize objects by their conventional names, for the
purpose of comprehending name-and-form, a meditator makes use of those factors
that are included under ‘name’: feeling, perception, intention, contact and
attention. All these have a specific value to each individual and that is why
the Dhamma has to be understood each one by himself – <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo</em>.
This Dhamma has to be realized by oneself. One has to understand one’s own
world of name-and-form by oneself. No one else can do it for him. Nor can it be
defined or denoted by technical terms.</p>
<p>Now it is in this world of name-and-form that suffering is found. According to
the Buddha, suffering is not out there in the conventional world of worldly
philosophers. It is to be found in this very name-and-form world. So the
ultimate aim of a meditator is to cut off the craving in this name-and-form. As
it is said: <em>acchecchi taṇhaṁ idha nāmarūpe</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Now if we are to bring in a simile to clarify this point, the Buddha is called
the incomparable surgeon, <em>sallakatto anuttaro</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn12">12</a></sup> Also he is sometimes
called <em>taṇhāsallassa hantāraṁ</em>, one who removes the dart of craving.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn13">13</a></sup> So
the Buddha is the incomparable surgeon who pulls out the poison-tipped arrow of
craving.</p>
<p>We may say therefore that, according to the Dhamma, <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, or
name-and-form, is like the wound in which the arrow is embedded. When one is
wounded by a poison-tipped arrow, the bandage has to be put, not on the archer
or on his bow-string, but on the wound itself. First of all the wound has to be
well located and cleaned up. Similarly, the comprehension of name-and-form is
the preliminary step in the treatment of the wound caused by the poison-tipped
arrow of craving.</p>
<p>And it is for that purpose that a meditator has to pay special attention to
those basic components of ‘name’ – feeling, perception, intention, contact and
attention – however much he may be proficient in words found in worldly usage.
It may even appear as a process of unlearning down to childlike simplicity. But
of course, the equanimity implied there, is not based on ignorance but on
knowledge.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in a similar situation with regard to the significance of
<em>rūpa</em> in <em>nāma-rūpa</em>. Here too we have something deep, but many take
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> to mean ‘mind and matter’. Like materialists, they think there is a
contrast between mind and matter. But according to the Dhamma there is no such
rigid distinction. It is a pair that is interrelated and taken together it forms
an important link in the chain of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p><em>Rūpa</em> exists in relation to ‘name’ and that is to say that form is known with
the help of ‘name’. As we saw above, that child got a first-hand knowledge of
the rubber ball with the help of contact, feeling, perception, intention and
attention. Now in the definition of ‘form’ as <em>cattāri ca mahābhūtāni,
catunnañca mahābhūtānaṁ upādāya rūpaṁ</em> the four great primaries are mentioned
because they constitute the most primary notion of ‘form’. Just as much as
feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention represent the most primary
notion of ‘name’, conventionally so called, even so the four great primaries
form the basis for the primary notion of ‘form’, as the world understands it.</p>
<p>It is not an easy matter to recognize these primaries. They are evasive like
ghosts. But out of their interplay we get the perception of form, <em>rūpasaññā</em>.
In fact what is called <em>rūpa</em> in this context is <em>rūpasaññā</em>. It is with
reference to the behaviour of the four great elements that the world builds up
its concept of form. Its perception, recognition and designation of form is in
terms of that behaviour. And that behaviour can be known with the help of those
members representing name.</p>
<p>The earth element is recognized through the qualities of hardness and softness,
the water element through the qualities of cohesiveness and dissolution, the
fire element through hotness and coolness, and the wind element through motion
and inflation. In this way one gets acquainted with the nature of the four great
primaries. And the perception of form, <em>rūpasaññā</em>, that one has at the back of
one’s mind, is the net result of that acquaintance. So this is <em>nāma-rūpa</em>. This
is one’s world. The relationship between <em>rūpa</em> and <em>rūpasaññā</em> will be clear
from the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>etthesā chijjate jaṭā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a verse found in the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. In that
sutta we find a deity putting a riddle before the Buddha for solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anto jaṭā bahi jaṭā,</em> <br />
<em>jaṭāya jaṭitā pajā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ taṁ Gotama pucchāmi,</em> <br />
<em>ko imaṁ vijaṭaye jaṭaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tangle within, and a tangle without, <br />
The world is entangled with a tangle. <br />
About that, oh Gotama, I ask you, <br />
Who can disentangle this tangle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha answers the riddle in three verses, the first of which is fairly well
known, because it happens to be the opening verse of the <em>Visuddhimagga</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sīle patiṭṭhāya naro sapañño,</em> <br />
<em>cittaṁ paññañca bhāvayaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ātāpī nipako bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>so imaṁ vijaṭaye jataṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that a wise monk, established in virtue, developing concentration and
wisdom, being ardent and prudent, is able to disentangle this tangle. Now this
is the second verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yesaṁ rāgo ca doso ca,</em> <br />
<em>avijjā ca virājitā,</em> <br />
<em>khīṇāsavā arahanto,</em> <br />
<em>tesaṁ vijaṭitā jaṭā.</em></p>
<p>In whom lust, hate <br />
And ignorance have faded away, <br />
Those influx-free <em>arahants</em>, <br />
It is in them that the tangle is disentangled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the third verse that is relevant to our topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>etthesā chijjate jaṭā</em>.</p>
<p>Where name and form <br />
As well as resistance and the perception of form <br />
Are completely cut off, <br />
It is there that the tangle gets snapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference here is to Nibbāna. It is there that the tangle is disentangled.</p>
<p>The coupling of name-and-form with <em>paṭigha</em> and <em>rūpasaññā</em> in this context, is
significant. Here <em>paṭigha</em> does not mean ‘repugnance’, but ‘resistance’. It is
the resistance which comes as a reaction to inert matter. For instance, when one
knocks against something in passing, one turns back to recognize it. Sense
reaction is something like that.</p>
<p>The Buddha has said that the worldling is blind until at least the Dhamma-eye
arises in him. So the blind worldling recognizes an object by the very
resistance he experiences in knocking against that object.</p>
<p><em>Paṭigha</em> and <em>rūpasaññā</em> form a pair. <em>Paṭigha</em> is that experience of
resistance which comes by the knocking against an object, and <em>rūpasaññā</em>, as
perception of form, is the resulting recognition of that object. The perception
is in terms of what is hard, soft, hot or cold. Out of such perceptions common
to the blind worldlings, arises the conventional reality, the basis of which is
the world.</p>
<p>Knowledge and understanding are very often associated with words and concepts,
so much so that if one knows the name of a thing, one is supposed to know it.
Because of this misconception the world is in a tangle. Names and concepts,
particularly the nouns, perpetuate the ignorance in the world. Therefore insight
is the only path of release. And that is why a meditator practically comes down
to the level of a child in order to understand name and form. He may even have
to pretend to be a patient in slowing down his movements for the sake of
developing mindfulness and full awareness.</p>
<p>So we see that there is something really deep in <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, even if we render
it as ‘name-and-form’. There is an implicit connection with ‘name’ as
conventionally so called, but unfortunately this connection is ignored in the
commentaries, when they bring in the idea of ‘bending’ to explain the word
‘name’. So we need not hesitate to render <em>nāma-rūpa</em> by ‘name-and-form’. Simple
as it may appear, it goes deeper than the worldly concepts of name and form.</p>
<p>Now if we are to summarise all what we have said in this connection, we may say:
‘name’ in ‘name-and-form’ is a <strong>formal</strong> name. It is an apparent name. ‘Form’
in ‘name-and-form’ is a <strong>nominal</strong> form. It is a form only in name.</p>
<p>We have to make a similar comment on the meaning of the word Nibbāna. Here too
one can see some unusual semantic developments in the commentarial period. It is
very common these days to explain the etymology of the word Nibbāna with the
help of a phrase like: <em>Vānasaṅkhātāya taṇhāya nikkhantattā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn15">15</a></sup> And that is
to say that Nibbāna is so called because it is an exit from craving which is a
form of weaving.</p>
<p>To take the element <em>vāna</em> in the word to mean a form of weaving is as good as
taking <em>nāma</em> in <em>nāma-rūpa</em> as some kind of bending. It is said that craving is
a kind of weaving in the sense that it connects up one form of existence with
another and the prefix <em>ni</em> is said to signify the exit from that weaving.</p>
<p>But nowhere in the suttas do we get this sort of etymology and interpretation.
On the other hand it is obvious that the suttas use the word Nibbāna in the
sense of ‘extinguishing’ or ‘extinction’. In fact this is the sense that brings
out the true essence of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>For instance the <em>Ratanasutta</em>, which is so often chanted as a <em>paritta</em>, says
that the <em>arahants</em> go out like a lamp: <em>Nibbanti dhīrā yathāyaṁ padīpo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn16">16</a></sup>
“Those wise ones get extinguished even like this lamp.”</p>
<p>The simile of a lamp getting extinguished is also found in the
<em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> Sometimes it is the figure
of a torch going out: <em>Pajjotass’eva nibbānaṁ, vimokho cetaso ahu</em>, “the mind’s
release was like the extinguishing of a torch.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>The simile of the extinction of a fire is very often brought in as an
illustration of Nibbāna and in the <em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em> we find the Buddha presenting it as a sustained simile, giving it a
deeper philosophical dimension.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn19">19</a></sup> Now when a fire burns, it does so with
the help of firewood. When a fire is burning, if someone were to ask us: “What
is burning?” – what shall we say as a reply? Is it the wood that is burning or
the fire that is burning? The truth of the matter is that the wood burns because
of the fire and the fire burns because of the wood. So it seems we already have
here a case of relatedness of this to that, <em>idappaccayatā.</em> This itself shows
that there is a very deep significance in the fire simile.</p>
<p>Nibbāna as a term for the ultimate aim of this Dhamma is equally significant
because of its allusion to the going out of a fire. In the <em>Asaṅkhatasaṁyutta</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> as many as thirty-three terms are listed to denote this
ultimate aim.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn20">20</a></sup> But out of all these epithets, Nibbāna became the most
widely used, probably because of its significant allusion to the fire. The fire
simile holds the answer to many questions relating to the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>The wandering ascetic Vacchagotta, as well as many others, accused the Buddha
of teaching a doctrine of annihilation: <em>Sato sattassa ucchedaṁ vināsaṁ vibhavaṁ
paññāpeti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn21">21</a></sup> Their accusation was that the Buddha proclaims the
annihilation, destruction and non-existence of a being that is existent. And the
Buddha answered them fairly and squarely with the fire simile.</p>
<p>“Now if a fire is burning in front of you dependent on grass and twigs as fuel,
you would know that it is burning dependently and not independently, that there
is no fire in the abstract. And when the fire goes out, with the exhaustion of
that fuel, you would know that it has gone out because the conditions for its
existence are no more.”</p>
<p>As a sidelight to the depth of this argument it may be mentioned that the Pāli
word <em>upādāna</em> used in such contexts has the sense of both ‘fuel’ as well as
‘grasping’, and in fact, fuel is something that the fire grasps for its burning.
<em>Upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>, “dependent on grasping is existence”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> These are
two very important links in the doctrine of dependent arising, <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>The eternalists, overcome by the craving for existence, thought that there is
some permanent essence in existence as a reality. But what had the Buddha to say
about existence? He said that what is true for the fire is true for existence as
well. That is to say that existence is dependent on grasping. So long as there
is a grasping, there is an existence. As we saw above, the firewood is called
<em>upādāna</em> because it catches fire. The fire catches hold of the wood, and the
wood catches hold of the fire. And so we call it firewood. This is a case of a
relation of this to that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>. Now it is the same with what is
called ‘existence’, which is not an absolute reality.</p>
<p>Even in the <em>Vedic</em> period there was the dilemma between ‘being’ and
‘non-being’. They wondered whether being came out of non-being, or non-being
came out of being. <em>Katham asataḥ sat jāyeta</em>, “How could being come out of
non-being?”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn23">23</a></sup> In the face of this dilemma regarding the first beginnings,
they were sometimes forced to conclude that there was neither non-being nor
being at the start, <em>nāsadāsīt no sadāsīt tadānīm</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn24-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn24">24</a></sup> Or else in the
confusion they would sometimes leave the matter unsolved, saying that perhaps
only the creator knew about it.</p>
<p>All this shows what a lot of confusion these two words <em>sat</em> and <em>asat</em>, being
and non-being, had created for the philosophers. It was only the Buddha who
presented a perfect solution, after a complete reappraisal of the whole problem
of existence. He pointed out that existence is a fire kept up by the fuel of
grasping, so much so that, when grasping ceases, existence ceases as well.</p>
<p>In fact the fire simile holds the answer to the tetralemma included among the
ten unexplained points very often found mentioned in the suttas. It concerns
the state of the Tathāgata after death, whether he exists, does not exist,
both or neither. The presumption of the questioner is that one or the other of
these four must be and could be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The Buddha solves or dissolves this presumptuous tetralemma by bringing in the
fire simile. He points out that when a fire goes out with the exhaustion of the
fuel, it is absurd to ask in which direction the fire has gone. All that one can
say about it, is that the fire has gone out: <em>Nibbuto tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em>,
“it comes to be reckoned as ‘gone out’.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn25-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>It is just a reckoning, an idiom, a worldly usage, which is not to be taken too
literally. So this illustration through the fire simile drives home to the
worldling the absurdity of his presumptuous tetralemma of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>In the <em>Upasīvasutta</em> of the <em>Pārāyaṇavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> we find the
lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accī yathā vātavegena khitto,</em> <br />
<em>atthaṁ paleti na upeti saṅkhaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Like the flame thrown out by the force of the wind <br />
Reaches its end, it cannot be reckoned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the reckoning is to be understood in terms of the four propositions of the
tetralemma. Such reckonings are based on a total misconception of the phenomenon
of fire.</p>
<p>It seems that the deeper connotations of the word Nibbāna in the context of
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> were not fully appreciated by the commentators. And that is
why they went in search of a new etymology. They were too shy of the
implications of the word ‘extinction’. Probably to avoid the charge of nihilism
they felt compelled to reinterpret certain key passages on Nibbāna. They
conceived Nibbāna as something existing out there in its own right. They would
not say where, but sometimes they would even say that it is everywhere. With an
undue grammatical emphasis they would say that it is on coming to that Nibbāna
that lust and other defilements are abandoned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nibbānaṁ āgamma rāgādayo khīṇāti ekameva nibbānaṁ rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo
mohakkhayo ti vuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what do we find in the joyous utterances of the <em>theras</em> and <em>therīs</em> who
had realized Nibbāna? As recorded in such texts as <em>Thera-</em> and <em>Therī-gāthā</em>
they would say: <em>Sītibhūto’smi nibbuto</em>, “I am grown cool, extinguished as I
am.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn28">28</a></sup> The words <em>sītibhūta</em> and <em>nibbuta</em> had a cooling effect even to the
listener, though later scholars found them inadequate.</p>
<p>Extinction is something that occurs within an individual and it brings with it a
unique bliss of appeasement. As the <em>Ratanasutta</em> says: <em>Laddhā mudhā nibbutiṁ
bhuñjamānā</em>, “they experience the bliss of appeasement won free of
charge.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn29">29</a></sup> Normally, appeasement is won at a cost, but here we have an
appeasement that comes gratis.</p>
<p>From the worldly point of view ‘extinction’ means annihilation. It has
connotations of a precipice that is much dreaded. That is why the commentators
conceived of it as something out there, on reaching which the defilements are
abandoned, <em>nibbānaṁ āgamma rāgādayo khīṇāti</em>. Sometimes they would say that it
is on seeing Nibbāna that craving is destroyed.</p>
<p>There seems to be some contradiction in the commentarial definitions of
Nibbāna. On the one hand we have the definition of Nibbāna as the exit from
craving, which is called a ‘weaving’. And on the other it is said that it is on
seeing Nibbāna that craving is destroyed. To project Nibbāna into a distance
and to hope that craving will be destroyed only on seeing it, is something like
trying to build a staircase to a palace one cannot yet see. In fact this is a
simile which the Buddha had used in his criticism of the Brahmin’s point of
view.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <em>Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</em> we have a very clear statement of the third
noble truth. Having first said that the second noble truth is craving, the
Buddha goes on to define the third noble truth in these words: <em>Tassāyeva
taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>This is to say that the third noble truth is the complete fading away,
cessation, giving up, relinquishment of that very craving. That it is the
release from and non-attachment to that very craving. In other words it is the
destruction of this very mass of suffering which is just before us.</p>
<p>In the suttas the term <em>taṇhakkhayo</em>, the destruction of craving, is very
often used as a term for Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn32">32</a></sup> But the commentator says that
destruction alone is not Nibbāna: <em>Khayamattaṁ na nibbānaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn33">33</a></sup> But the
destruction of craving itself is called the highest bliss in the following verse
of the <em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yañca kāmasukhaṁ loke,</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ c’idaṁ diviyaṁ sukhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>taṇhakkhaya sukhass’ete,</em> <br />
<em>kalaṁ n’agghanti soḷasiṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever bliss from sense-desires there is in the world, <br />
Whatever divine bliss there is, <br />
All these are not worth one-sixteenth <br />
Of the bliss of the destruction of craving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the verses found in the <em>Udāna</em> are extremely deep and this is
understandable, since <em>udāna</em> means a ‘joyous utterance’. Generally a joyous
utterance comes from the very depths of one’s heart, like a sigh of relief. As a
matter of fact one often finds that the concluding verse goes far deeper in its
implications than the narrative concerned. For instance, in the <em>Udapānasutta</em>,
we get the following joyous utterance, coming from the Buddha himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁ kayirā udapānena,</em> <br />
<em>āpā ce sabbadā siyuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>taṇhāya mūlato chetvā,</em> <br />
<em>kissa pariyesanaṁ care</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>What is the use of a well, <br />
If water is there all the time, <br />
Having cut craving at the root, <br />
In search of what should one wander?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the destruction of craving is not a mere destruction.</p>
<p>Craving is a form of thirst and that is why Nibbāna is sometimes called
<em>pipāsavinayo</em>, the dispelling of the thirst.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn36">36</a></sup> To think that the
destruction of craving is not sufficient is like trying to give water to one who
has already quenched his thirst. But the destruction of craving has been called
the highest bliss. One who has quenched his thirst for good, is aware of that
blissful experience. When he sees the world running here and there in search of
water, he looks within and sees the well-spring of his bliss.</p>
<p>However to most of our scholars the term <em>taṇhakkhaya</em> appeared totally negative
and that is why they hesitated to recognize its value. In such conventional
usages as <em>Nibbānaṁ āgamma</em> they found a grammatical excuse to separate that
term from Nibbāna.</p>
<p>According to the Buddha the cessation of existence is Nibbāna and that means
Nibbāna is the realization of the cessation of existence. Existence is said to
be an eleven-fold fire. So the entire existence is a raging fire. Lust, hate,
delusion – all these are fires. Therefore Nibbāna may be best rendered by the
word ‘extinction’. When once the fires are extinguished, what more is needed?</p>
<p>But unfortunately Venerable Buddhaghosa was not prepared to appreciate this
point of view. In his <em>Visuddhimagga</em> as well as in the commentaries
<em>Sāratthappakāsinī</em> and <em>Sammohavinodanī</em>, he gives a long discussion on
Nibbāna in the form of an argument with an imaginary heretic.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn37">37</a></sup> Some of
his arguments are not in keeping with either the letter or the spirit of the
Dhamma.</p>
<p>First of all he gets the heretic to put forward the idea that the destruction of
lust, hate and delusion is Nibbāna. Actually the heretic is simply quoting the
Buddha word, for in the <em>Nibbānasutta</em> of the <em>Asaṅkhatasaṁyutta</em> the
destruction of lust, hate and delusion is called Nibbāna: <em>Rāgakkhayo,
dosakkhayo, mohakkhayo – idaṁ vuccati nibbānaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The words <em>rāgakkhaya, dosakkhaya</em> and <em>mohakkhaya</em> together form a synonym of
Nibbāna, but the commentator interprets it as three synonyms. Then he argues
out with the imaginary heretic that if Nibbāna is the extinguishing of lust it
is something common even to the animals, for they also extinguish their fires of
lust through enjoyment of the corresponding objects of sense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> This
argument ignores the deeper sense of the word extinction, as it is found in the
Dhamma.</p>
<p>In the <em>Māgaṇḍiyasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> the Buddha gives the simile of
a man with a skin disease sitting beside a pit of hot embers to explain the
position of lustful beings in the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn40">40</a></sup> That man is simply trying to
assuage his pains by the heat of the fire. It is an attempt to warm up, not to
cool down. Similarly what the lustful beings in the world are doing in the face
of the fires of lust is a warming up. It can in no way be compared to the
extinction and the cooling down of the <em>arahants</em>.</p>
<p>As the phrase <em>nibbutiṁ bhuñjamānā</em> implies, that extinction is a blissful
experience for the <em>arahants</em>. It leaves a permanent effect on the <em>arahant</em>, so
much so that upon reflection he sees that his influxes are extinct, just as a
man with his hands and feet cut off, knows upon reflection that his limbs are
gone.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn41">41</a></sup> It seems that the deeper implications of the word Nibbāna have
been obscured by a set of arguments which are rather misleading.</p>
<p>In fact I came forward to give these sermons for three reasons: Firstly because
the venerable Great Preceptor invited me to do so. Secondly in the hope that it
will be of some benefit to my co-dwellers in the Dhamma. And thirdly because I
myself felt rather concerned about the inadequacy of the existing
interpretations.</p>
<p>What we have said so far is just about the word Nibbāna as such. Quite a
number of suttas on Nibbāna will be taken up for discussion. This is just a
preamble to show that the word Nibbāna in the sense of ‘extinction’ has a
deeper dimension, which has some relevance to the law of dependent arising,
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>By bringing in an etymology based on the element <em>vāna</em>, much of the original
significance of the word Nibbāna came to be undermined. On quite a number of
occasions the Buddha has declared that the cessation of suffering is Nibbāna,
or else that the destruction of craving is Nibbāna. Terms like <em>dukkhanirodho</em>
and <em>taṇhakkhayo</em> have been used as synonyms. If they are synonyms, there is no
need to make any discrimination with regard to some of them, by insisting on a
periphrastic usage like <em>āgamma</em>.</p>
<p>Yet another important aspect of the problem is the relation of Nibbāna to the
holy life or <em>brahmacariya</em>. It is said that when the holy life is lived out to
the full, it culminates in Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> we find the Venerable Rādha
putting a series of questions to the Buddha to get an explanation. First
of all he asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sammādassanaṁ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṁ?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>For what purpose is right vision?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha gives the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sammādassanaṁ kho, Rādha, nibbidatthaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>Rādha, right vision is for purposes of disgust or dejection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is to say, disgust for <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>The next question is: for what purpose is disgust? And the Buddha answers:
disgust is for dispassion. What is the purpose of dispassion? The purpose of
dispassion is release. What is the purpose of release? The purpose of release is
Nibbāna. Last of all Venerable Rādha puts the question:</p>
<p><em>Nibbānaṁ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṁ</em>? “For what purpose is Nibbāna?” And the
Buddha gives this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accasarā, Rādha, pañhaṁ, nāsakkhi pañhassa pariyantaṁ gahetuṁ.
Nibbānogadhañhi, Rādha, brahmacariyaṁ vussati, nibbānaparāyanaṁ
nibbānapariyosānaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Rādha, you have gone beyond the scope of your questions, you are unable to
grasp the limit of your questions. For, Rādha, the holy life is merged in
Nibbāna, its consummation is Nibbāna, its culmination is Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the holy life gets merged in Nibbāna, just as rivers get
merged in the sea. In other words, where the holy life is lived out to the full,
Nibbāna is right there. That is why Venerable Nanda, who earnestly took up
the holy life encouraged by the Buddha’s promise of heavenly nymphs, attained
<em>arahanthood</em> almost in spite of himself. At last he approached the Buddha and
begged to relieve him of the onus of his promise. This shows that when one
completes the training in the Holy Life, one is already in Nibbāna. Only when
the training is incomplete, can one go to heaven.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a result which comes of its own accord. So there is no
justification for a periphrastic usage like, ‘on reaching Nibbāna’. No glimpse
of a distant object is necessary. At whatever moment the Noble Eightfold Path is
perfected, one attains Nibbāna then and there. Now, in the case of an
examination, after answering the question paper, one has to wait for the
results – to get a pass.</p>
<p>Here it is different. As soon as you have answered the paper correctly, you have
passed im-mediately and the certificate is already there. This is the
significance of the term <em>aññā</em> used in such contexts. <em>Aññā</em> stands for full
certitude of the experience of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The experience of the fruit of <em>arahantship</em> gives him the final certificate of
his attainment, <em>aññāphalo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn43">43</a></sup> That is why Nibbāna is called something to
be realized. One gets the certitude that birth is extinct and that the holy life
is lived out to the full, <em>khīṇā jāti, vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course there are some who still go on asking: what is the purpose of
Nibbāna? And it is to answer this type of question that many scholars go on
hair splitting. Normally in the world, whatever one does has some purpose or
other. All occupations, all trades and businesses, are for gain and profit.
Thieves and burglars also have some purpose in mind. But what is the purpose of
trying to attain Nibbāna? What is the purpose of Nibbāna? Why should one
attain Nibbāna?</p>
<p>It is to give an answer to this question that scholars brought in such phrases
as <em>Nibbānaṁ pana āgamma</em>, ‘on reaching Nibbāna’. They would say that ‘on
reaching Nibbāna’, craving would be destroyed. On closer analysis it would
appear that there is some fallacy in this question. For if there is any aim or
purpose in attaining Nibbāna, Nibbāna would not be the ultimate aim. In
other words, if Nibbāna is the ultimate aim, there should be no aim in
attaining Nibbāna. Though it may well sound a tautology, one has to say that
Nibbāna is the ultimate aim for the simple reason that there is no aim beyond
it.</p>
<p>However, this might need more explanation. Now as far as craving is concerned,
it has the nature of projection or inclination. It is something bent forward,
with a forward view, and that is why it is called <em>bhavanetti</em>, the leader in
becoming.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn45">45</a></sup> It leads one on and on in existence, like the carrot before the
donkey. So that is why all objects presented by craving have some object or
purpose as a projection. Craving is an inclination.</p>
<p>But what is the position if one makes the destruction of craving itself one’s
object? Now craving because of its inclining nature is always bent forward, so
much so that we get an infinite progression. This is for that, and that is for
the other. As the phrase <em>taṇhā ponobhavikā</em> implies, craving brings up
existence again and again.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="sermon-01.html#fn-fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>But this is not the case when one makes the destruction of craving one’s aim.
When that aim is attained, there is nothing more to be done. So this brings us
to the conclusion that the term <em>taṇhakkhayo</em>, destruction of craving, is a
full-fledged synonym of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Well, this much is enough for today. Time permitting and life permitting, I hope
to continue with these sermons. I suppose the most Venerable Great Preceptor
made this invitation with the idea of seeing one of his children at play. For
good or for bad, I have taken up the invitation. Let the future of the <em>Sāsana</em>
be the final judge of its merits.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>The second sermon on Nibbāna has come up for today. Towards the end of our
sermon the other day we raised the point: Why is it improper to ask such
questions as: ‘What is the purpose of Nibbāna? Why should one attain
Nibbāna?’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn48">2</a></sup> Our explanation was that since the holy life or the Noble
Eightfold Path has Nibbāna as its ultimate aim, since it gets merged in
Nibbāna, any questions as to the ultimate purpose of Nibbāna would be
inappropriate.</p>
<p>In fact at some places in the canon we find the phrase <em>anuttara
brahmacariyapariyosāna</em> used with reference to Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn49">3</a></sup> It means that
Nibbāna is the supreme consummation of the holy life. The following standard
phrase announcing a new <em>arahant</em> is very often found in the suttas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassatthāya kulaputtā sammadeva agārasmā anagāriyaṁ pabbajanti, tadanuttaraṁ
brahmacariyapariyosānaṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja
vihāsi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn50">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In this very life he realized by his own higher knowledge and attained to
that supreme consummation of the holy life for the purpose of which clansmen
of good family rightly go forth from home to homelessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is the justification for saying that one attains to Nibbāna by the
very completion of the holy life? This Noble Eightfold Path is a straight path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ujuko nāma so maggo, abhayā nāma sā disā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn51">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This path is called the ‘straight’ and the direction it goes is called the
‘fearless’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Itivuttaka</em> we come across a verse which expresses this idea more
vividly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sekhassa sikkhamānassa,</em> <br />
<em>ujumaggānusārino,</em> <br />
<em>khayasmiṁ paṭhamaṁ ñāṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tato aññā anantarā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn52">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To the learner, learning <br />
In pursuit of the straight path, <br />
First comes the knowledge of destruction <br />
And then immediately the certitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the fruit of <em>arahantship</em> which gives him the certitude of the
attainment of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Here the word <em>anantarā</em> has been used. That concentration proper to the fruit
of <em>arahantship</em> is called <em>ānantarikā samādhi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn53">7</a></sup> This means that the
attainment of the fruit is immediate.</p>
<p>Though it may be so in the case of the <em>arahant</em>, what about the stream-winner,
the <em>sotāpanna</em>, one may ask. There is a general belief that in the case of a
<em>sotāpanna</em> the vision of Nibbāna is like a glimpse of a distant lamp on a
road with many bends and the <em>sotāpanna</em> has just negotiated the first bend.</p>
<p>But in accordance with the Dhamma it may be said that the norm of immediacy is
applicable even to the knowledge of the first path. One who attains to the fruit
of stream-winning may be a beggar, an illiterate person, or a seven year old
child. It may be that he has heard the Dhamma for the first time. All the
same, a long line of epithets is used with reference to him in the suttas as
his qualifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho
vigatakathaṁkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn54">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammo</em>, he is one who has seen the Dhamma, the truth of Nibbāna. It
is said in the <em>Ratanasutta</em> that along with the vision of the first path, three
fetters are abandoned, namely <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, the self-hood view, <em>vicikicchā</em>,
sceptical doubt, and <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>, attachment to holy vows and ascetic
practices.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn55">9</a></sup> Some might argue that only these fetters are abandoned at this
stage, because it is a glimpse of Nibbāna from a distance.</p>
<p>But then there is this second epithet, <em>pattadhammo</em>, which means that he has
reached the Dhamma, that he has arrived at Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Not only that, he is <em>viditadhammo</em>, he is one who has understood the Dhamma,
which is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>He is <em>pariyogāḷhadhammo</em>, he has plunged into the Dhamma, he has dived into
the Dhamma, which is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>He is <em>tiṇṇavicikiccho</em>, he has crossed over doubts.</p>
<p><em>Vigatakathaṁkatho</em>, his waverings are gone.</p>
<p><em>Vesārajjappatto</em>, he has attained to proficiency.</p>
<p><em>Aparappaccayo satthusāsane</em>, in regard to the dispensation of the teacher he is
not dependent on others. And that is to say that he could attain to Nibbāna
even without another’s help, though of course with the teacher’s help he would
attain it sooner.</p>
<p>So this string of epithets testifies to the efficacy of the realization by the
first path. It is not a mere glimpse of Nibbāna from a distance. It is a
reaching, an arrival or a plunge into Nibbāna.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration we may bring in a legend connected with the history
of Sri Lanka. It is said that when King Gajabāhu invaded India, one of his
soldiers, Nīla, who had Herculean strength, parted the seawater with a huge
iron bar in order to make way for the king and the army. Now when the
supramundane path arises in the mind the power of thought is as mighty as the
blow of Nīla with his iron bar. Even with the first blow the sea-water parted,
so that one could see the bottom.</p>
<p>Similarly the sweeping influxes are parted for a moment when the transcendental
path arises in a mind, enabling one to see the very bottom – Nibbāna. In
other words, all preparations (<em>saṅkhāras</em>) are stilled for a moment, enabling
one to see the cessation of preparations.</p>
<p>We have just given a simile by way of illustration, but incidentally there is a
<em>Dhammapada</em> verse which comes closer to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma,</em> <br />
<em>kāme panuda brāhmaṇa</em>, <br />
<em>saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā,</em> <br />
<em>akataññū’si brāhmaṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn56">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Strive forth and cut off the stream, <br />
Discard, oh Brahmin, sense-desires, <br />
Having known the destruction of preparations, oh Brahmin, <br />
Become a knower of the un-made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this verse clearly indicates what the knowledge of the path does when it
arises. Just as one leaps forward and cuts off a stream of water, so it cuts
off, even for a moment, the preparations connected with craving. Thereby one
realizes the destruction of preparations – <em>saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā</em>.</p>
<p>Like the sea water parted by the blow of the iron bar, preparations part for a
moment to reveal the very bottom which is ‘unprepared’, the <em>asaṅkhata</em>.
<em>Akata</em>, or the un-made, is the same as <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the unprepared. So one has
had a momentary vision of the sea bottom, which is free from preparations. Of
course, after that experience, influxes flow in again. But one kind of influxes,
namely <em>diṭṭhāsavā</em>, influxes of views, are gone for good and will never flow in
again.</p>
<p>Now how was it that some with keen wisdom like Bāhiya attained <em>arahantship</em>
even while listening to a short sermon from the Buddha? They had dealt four
powerful blows in quick succession with the iron bar of the path-knowledge to
clear away all possible influxes.</p>
<p>What is called <em>akata</em> or <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the un-made or the un-prepared, is not
something out there in a distance, as an object of thought. It is not a sign to
be grasped by one who wants to attain Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Language encourages us to think in terms of signs. Very often we find it
difficult to get rid of this habit. The worldlings with their defilements have
to communicate with each other and the structure of the language has to answer
their needs. So the subject-object relationship has become a very significant
feature in a language. It always carries the implication that there is a thing
to be grasped and that there is someone who grasps, that there is a doer and a
thing done. So it is almost impossible to avoid such usages as: ‘I want to see
Nibbāna, I want to attain Nibbāna’. We are made to think in terms of getting
and attaining.</p>
<p>However sometimes the Buddha reminds us that this is only a conventional usage
and that these worldly usages are not to be taken too seriously. We come across
such an instance in the <em>Sagāthavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> where the Buddha
retorts to some questions put by a certain deity. The deity named Kakudha asks
the Buddha:</p>
<p>“Do you rejoice, oh recluse?”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn57">11</a></sup> And the Buddha retorts: “On getting what, friend?”
Then the deity asks: “Then, recluse, do you grieve?” And the Buddha quips back:
“On losing what, friend?” So the deity concludes: “Well then, recluse, you
neither rejoice nor grieve!” And the Buddha replies: “That is so, friend.”</p>
<p>It seems, then, that though we say we ‘attain’ Nibbāna there is nothing to
gain and nothing to lose. If anything – <strong>what is lost is an ignorance that
there is something, and a craving that there is not enough</strong> – and that is all
one loses.</p>
<p>Now there are quite a number of synonyms for Nibbāna, such as <em>akata</em> and
<em>asaṅkhata</em>. As already mentioned, there is even a list of thirty-three such
epithets, out of which one is <em>dīpa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn58">12</a></sup> Now <em>dīpa</em> means an island. When we
are told that Nibbāna is an island, we tend to imagine some sort of existence
in a beautiful island. But in the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> the
Buddha gives a good corrective to that kind of imagining in his reply to a
question put by the Brahmin youth Kappa, a pupil of Bāvarī. Kappa puts his
question in the following impressive verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>oghe jāte mahabbhaye,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparetānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpaṁ pabrūhi mārisa,</em> <br />
<em>tvañca me dīpam akkhāhi,</em> <br />
<em>yathayidaṁ nāparaṁ siyā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn59">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Unto them that stand midstream, <br />
When the frightful floods flow forth, <br />
To them in decay-and-death forlorn, <br />
An island, sire, may you proclaim. <br />
An island which non else excels, <br />
Yea, such an isle, pray tell me sire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha gives his answer in two inspiring verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>oghe jāte mahabbhaye,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparetānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpaṁ pabrūmi Kappa te.</em></p>
<p><em>Akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ dīpaṁ anāparaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nibbānaṁ iti naṁ brūmi,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Unto them that stand midstream, <br />
When the frightful floods flow forth, <br />
To them in decay-and-death forlorn, <br />
An island, Kappa, I shall proclaim.</p>
<p>Owning naught, grasping naught, <br />
The isle is this, none else besides. <br />
Nibbāna, that is how I call that isle, <br />
Wherein is decay decayed and death is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Akiñcanaṁ</em> means ‘owning nothing’, <em>anādānaṁ</em> means ‘grasping nothing’. <em>Etaṁ
dīpaṁ anāparaṁ</em>, this is the island, nothing else. <em>Nibbānaṁ iti naṁ brūmi,
jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ</em>, “and that I call Nibbāna, which is the extinction of
decay-and-death.”</p>
<p>From this also we can infer that words like <em>akata</em>, <em>asaṅkhata</em> and
<em>sabba-saṅkhārā-samatha</em> are full fledged synonyms of Nibbāna. Nibbāna is
not some mysterious state quite apart from them. It is not something to be
projected into a distance.</p>
<p>Some are in the habit of getting down to a discussion on Nibbāna by putting
<em>saṅkhata</em> on one side and <em>asaṅkhata</em> on the other side. They start by saying
that <em>saṅkhata</em>, or the ‘prepared’, is <em>anicca</em>, or impermanent. If <em>saṅkhata</em>
is <em>anicca</em>, they conclude that <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>nicca</em>, that is the
unprepared must be permanent. Following the same line of argument they argue
that since <em>saṅkhata</em> is <em>dukkha</em>, <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>sukha</em>.</p>
<p>But when they come to the third step, they get into difficulties. If <em>saṅkhata</em>
is <em>anattā</em>, or not-self, then surely <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>attā</em>, or self. At
this point they have to admit that their argument is too facile and so they end
up by saying that after all Nibbāna is something to be realized.</p>
<p>All this confusion arises due to a lack of understanding of the law of Dependent
Arising, <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. Therefore, first of all, we have to say something
about the doctrine of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Ariyapariyesanasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, the Buddha,
soon after his enlightenment, reflected on the profundity of the Dhamma and
was rather disinclined to preach it. He saw two points in the doctrine that are
difficult for the world to see or grasp. One was <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Duddasaṁ idaṁ ṭhānaṁ yadidaṁ idappaccayatā paṭiccasamuppādo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn60">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Hard to see is this point, namely dependent arising which is a relatedness of
this to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the second point was Nibbāna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idampi kho ṭhānaṁ duddasaṁ yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>And this point, too, is difficult to see, namely the stilling of all
preparations, the relinquishment of all assets, the destruction of craving,
detachment, cessation, extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this context we can gather that if there is any term we can use to define
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, a term that comes closer to it in meaning, it is
<em>idappaccayatā</em>. The Buddha himself has described <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> in this
context as a relatedness of this to that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>. As a matter of fact
the basic principle which forms the noble norm of this doctrine of dependent
arising is this <em>idappaccayatā</em>. Let us now try to get at its meaning by
examining the doctrine of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>In quite a number of contexts, such as the <em>Bahudhātukasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em> and the <em>Bodhivagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em> the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is
set out in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassuppādā idaṁ uppajjati</em> <br />
<em>imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati –</em></p>
<p><em>yadidaṁ avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṁ, viññāṇapaccayā
nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṁ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso,
phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ,
upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti. Evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti.</em></p>
<p><em>Avijjāyatveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho, saṅkhāranirodhā
viññāṇanirodho, viññāṇanirodhā nāmarūpanirodho, nāmarūpanirodhā
saḷāyatananirodho, saḷāyatananirodhā phassanirodho, phassanirodhā
vedanānirodho, vedanānirodhā taṇhānirodho, taṇhānirodhā upādānanirodho,
upādānanirodhā bhavanirodho, bhavanirodhā jātinirodho, jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā nirujjhanti. Evametassa kevalassa

<p>Thus: – This being – this comes to be <br />

</blockquote>
<p>This is the thematic statement of the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. It is set out
here in the form of a fundamental principle.</p>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti</em>, “this being, this comes to be.”</p>
<p><em>Imassuppādā idaṁ uppajjati,</em> “with the arising of this, this arises.”</p>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti</em>, “this not being, this does not come to be”.</p>
<p><em>Imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati</em>, “with the cessation of this, this ceases.”</p>
<p>It resembles an algebraical formula.</p>
<p>And then we have the conjunctive <em>yadidaṁ</em>, which means ‘namely this’ or ‘that
is to say’. This shows that the foregoing statement is axiomatic and implies
that what follows is an illustration. So the twelve linked formula beginning
with the words <em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā</em> is that illustration. No doubt the
twelve-linked formula is impressive enough. But the important thing here is the
basic principle involved, and that is the fourfold statement beginning with
<em>imasmiṁ sati</em>.</p>
<p>This fact is very clearly brought out in a certain sutta in the <em>Nidānavagga</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. There the Buddha addresses the monks and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppādañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi paṭiccasamuppanne ca
dhamme</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn62">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I will teach you dependent arising and things that are dependently
arisen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular context the Buddha makes a distinction between dependent
arising and things that are dependently arisen. In order to explain what is
meant by dependent arising, or <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, he takes up the last two
links in the formula, in the words: <em>jātipaccayā, bhikkhave, jarāmaraṇaṁ</em>,
“monks, dependent on birth is decay-and-death.”</p>
<p>Then he draws attention to the importance of the basic principle involved:
<em>Uppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ anuppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ, ṭhitā va sā dhātu
dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā idappaccayatā</em> (etc.). Out of the long exhortation
given there, this is the part relevant to us here.</p>
<p><em>Jātipaccayā, bhikkhave, jarāmaraṇaṁ</em>,
“dependent on birth, oh monks, is decay-and-death”,
and that is to say that decay-and-death has birth as its condition.</p>
<p><em>Uppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ anuppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ</em>, “whether there be
an arising of the <em>Tathāgatās</em> or whether there be no such arising”.</p>
<p><em>Ṭhitā va sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā idappaccayatā</em>, “that elementary nature,
that orderliness of the Dhamma, that norm of the Dhamma, the relatedness of
this to that does stand as it is.”</p>
<p>So from this it is clear that the underlying principle could be understood even
with the help of a couple of links. But the commentary seems to have ignored
this fact in its definition of the term <em>idappaccayatā</em>. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imesaṁ jarāmaraṇādīnaṁ paccayā idappaccayā, idappaccayāva
idappaccayatā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn63-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn63">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>imesaṁ</em> is in the plural and this indicates that the commentator has
taken the dependence in a collective sense. But it is because of the fact that
even two links are sufficient to illustrate the law, that the Buddha follows it
up with the declaration that this is the <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. And then he goes
on to explain what is meant by ‘things dependently arisen’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katame ca, bhikkhave, paṭiccasamuppannā dhammā? Jarāmaraṇaṁ, bhikkhave,
aniccaṁ saṇkhataṁ paṭiccasamuppannaṁ khayadhammaṁ vayadhammaṁ virāgadhammaṁ
nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What, monks, are things dependently arisen?” And then, taking up just one of
the last links, he declares: “decay-and-death, monks, is impermanent, prepared,
dependently arisen, of a nature to get destroyed, to pass away, fade away and
cease.”</p>
<p>By the way, the word <em>virāga</em> usually means detachment or dispassion. But in
such contexts as <em>avijjāvirāgā</em> and <em>pītiyā ca virāgā</em> one has to render it by
words like ‘fading away’. So that <em>avijjāvirāga</em> could be rendered as: ‘by the
fading away of ignorance’, and <em>pītiyā virāgā</em> would mean ‘by the fading away of
joy’.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that decay-and-death themselves are impermanent, that they are
prepared or made up, that they are dependently arisen. Decay-and-death
themselves can get destroyed and pass away. Decay as well as death can fade away
and cease.</p>
<p>Then the Buddha takes up the preceding link <em>jāti</em>, or birth. And that too is
given the same qualifications. In the same manner he takes up each of the
preceding links up to and including ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, and applies to them the
above qualifications. It is significant that every one of the twelve links, even
ignorance, is said to be dependently arisen.</p>
<p>Let us try to understand how, for instance, decay-and-death themselves can get
destroyed or pass away. Taking the <em>idappaccayatā</em> formula as a paradigm, we can
illustrate the relationship between the two links birth and decay-and-death.
Instead of saying: this being, that comes to be (and so forth), now we have to
say: birth being, decay-and-death comes to be. With the arising of birth,
decay-and-death arises. Birth not being, decay-and-death does not come to be.
With the cessation of birth, decay-and-death ceases.</p>
<p>Now birth itself is an arising. But here we can’t help saying that birth
‘arises’. It is like saying that birth is born. How can birth get born?
Similarly death is a passing away. But here we have to say that death itself
‘passes away’. How can death pass away? Perhaps, as we proceed, we might get the
answers to these questions.</p>
<p>Now at this point let us take up for discussion a certain significant passage in
the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. In the course of an exposition of
the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, addressed to Venerable Ānanda, the Buddha
makes the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ettāvatā kho, Ānanda, jāyetha vā jīyetha vā mīyetha vā cavetha vā upapajjetha
vā. Ettāvatā adhivacanapatho, ettāvatā niruttipatho, ettāvatā paññattipatho,
ettāvatā paññāvacaraṁ, ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya yadidaṁ
nāmarūpaṁ saha viññāṇena</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn64-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn64">18</a></sup></p>
<p>In so far only, Ānanda, can one be born, or grow old, or die, or pass away,
or reappear, in so far only is there any pathway for verbal expression, in so
far only is there any pathway for terminology, in so far only is there any
pathway for designation, in so far only is the range of wisdom, in so far only
is the round kept going for there to be a designation as the this-ness, that
is to say: name-and-form together with consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have rendered the term <em>itthatta</em> by ‘this-ness’, and what it means will
become clear as we go on. In the above quotation the word <em>ettāvatā</em>, which
means ‘in so far only’, has as its point of reference the concluding phrase
<em>yadidaṁ nāmarūpaṁ saha viññāṇena</em>, “that is to say: name-and-form together with
consciousness”.</p>
<p>So the statement, as it is, expresses a complete idea. But some editions have an
additional phrase: <em>aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati</em>, “exists in a mutual
relationship”. This phrase is obviously superfluous and is probably a
commentarial addition.</p>
<p>What is meant by the Buddha’s statement is that name-and-form together with
consciousness is the rallying point for all concepts of birth, decay, death and
rebirth. All pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation
converge on name-and-form together with consciousness. The range of wisdom
extends only up to the relationship between these two. And it is between these
two that there is a whirling round so that one may point out a this-ness. In
short, the secret of the entire <em>saṁsāric</em> existence is to be found in this
whirlpool.</p>
<p><em>Vaṭṭa</em> and <em>āvaṭṭa</em> are words used for a whirlpool. We shall be bringing up
quotations in support of that meaning. It seems, however, that this meaning has
got obscured in the course of time. In the commentaries and in some modern
translations there is quite a lot of confusion with regard to the meaning of the
phrase <em>vaṭṭaṁ vattati</em>. In fact one Sinhala translation renders it as
‘<em>saṁsāric</em> rain’. What rain has to do with <em>saṁsāra</em> is a matter for
conjecture.</p>
<p>What is actually meant by <em>vaṭṭaṁ vattati</em> is a whirling round, and <em>saṁsāra</em>,
even literally, is that. Here we are told that there is a whirling round between
name-and-form and consciousness, and this is the <em>saṁsāric</em> whirlpool to which
all the aforesaid things are traceable.</p>
<p>Already in the first sermon we tried to show that name in name-and-form has to
do with names and concepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn65">19</a></sup> Now from this context it becomes clear that
all pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation converge on this
whirlpool between name-and-form and consciousness.</p>
<p>Now that we have attached so much significance to a whirlpool, let us try to
understand how a whirlpool is formed. Let us try to get at the natural laws
underlying its formation. How does a whirlpool come to be?</p>
<p>Suppose a river is flowing downward. To flow downward is in the nature of a
river. But a certain current of water thinks: “I can and must move upstream.”
And so it pushes on against the main stream. But at a certain point its progress
is checked by the main stream and is thrust aside, only to come round and make a
fresh attempt, again and again.</p>
<p>All these obstinate and unsuccessful attempts gradually lead to a whirling
round. As time goes on, the run-away current understands, as it were, that it
cannot move forward. But it does not give up. It finds an alternative aim in
moving towards the bottom. So it spirals downward, funnel-like, digging deeper
and deeper towards the bottom, until an abyss is formed. Here then we have a
whirlpool.</p>
<p>While all this is going on, there is a crying need to fill up the chasm, and the
whirlpool develops the necessary force of attraction to cater to it. It attracts
and grasps everything that comes within its reach and sends it whirling down,
funnel like, into the chasm. The whirling goes on at a tremendous speed, while
the circumference grows larger and larger. At last the whirlpool becomes a
centre of a tremendous amount of activity.</p>
<p>While this kind of activity is going on in a river or a sea, there is a
possibility for us to point it out as ‘that place’ or ‘this place’. Why? Because
there is an activity going on. Usually, in the world, the place where an
activity is going on is known as a ‘unit’, a ‘centre’, or an ‘institution’.
Since the whirlpool is also a centre of activity, we may designate it as a
‘here’ or ‘there’. We may even personify it. With reference to it, we can open
up pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation.</p>
<p>But if we are to consider the form of activity that is going on here, what is it
after all? It is only a perversion. That obstinate current thought to itself,
out of delusion and ignorance: I can and must move upstream. And so it tried and
failed, but turned round only to make the same vain attempt again and again.
Ironically enough, even its <strong>progress</strong> towards the bottom is a <strong>stagnation</strong>.</p>
<p>So here we have ignorance on one side and craving on the other, as a result of
the abyss formed by the whirlpool. In order to satisfy this craving there is
that power of attraction: grasping. Where there is <strong>grasping</strong>, there is
<strong>existence</strong>, or <strong><em>bhava</em></strong>. The entire whirlpool now appears as a centre of
activity.</p>
<p>Now the basic principle underlying this whirlpool is to be found in our bodies.
What we call ‘breathing’ is a continuous process of emptying and filling up. So
even the so-called ‘life-principle’ is not much different from the activity of a
whirlpool. The functioning of the lungs and the heart is based on the same
principle and the blood circulation is in fact a whirling round. This kind of
activity is very often known as ‘automatic’, a word which has connotations of
<strong>self</strong>-sufficiency. But at the root of it there is a perversion, as we saw in
the case of the whirlpool. All these activities are based on a conflict between
two opposite forces.</p>
<p>In fact existence in its entirety is not much different from the conflict of
that obstinate current of water with the main stream. This characteristic of
conflict is so pervasive that it can be seen even in the basic laws governing
the existence of a society. In our social life, rights and responsibilities go
hand in hand. We can enjoy certain privileges, provided we fulfil our duties. So
here too we have a tangle within and a tangle without.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn66">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Now this is about the existence of the society as such. And what about the field
of economics? There too the basic principles show the same weakness. Production
is governed by laws of supply and demand. There will be a supply so long as
there is a demand. Between them there is a conflict. It leads to many
complications. The price mechanism is on a precarious balance and that is why
some wealthy countries are forced to the ridiculous position of dumping their
surplus into the sea.</p>
<p>All this shows that existence is basically in a precarious position. To
illustrate this, let us take the case of two snakes of the same size, trying to
swallow up each other. Each of them tries to swallow up the other from the tail
upwards and when they are half way through the meal, what do we find? A <strong>snake
cycle</strong>. This snake cycle goes round and round, trying to swallow up each other.
But will it ever be successful?</p>
<p>The precarious position illustrated by the snake cycle, we find in our own
bodies in the form of respiration, blood circulation and so forth. What appears
as the stability in the society and in the economy, is similarly precarious. It
is because of this conflict, this unsatisfactoriness, that the Buddha concluded
that the whole of existence is suffering.</p>
<p>When the arising aspect is taken too seriously, to the neglect of the cessation
aspect, instead of a conflict or an unsatisfactoriness one tends to see
something automatic everywhere. This body as well as machines such as water
pumps and electrical appliances seem to work on an automatic principle. But in
truth there is only a conflict between two opposing forces. When one comes to
think of it, there is no ‘<strong>auto</strong>’-ness even in the automatic.</p>
<p>All that is there, is a bearing up with difficulty. And this in fact is the
meaning of the word <em>dukkha</em>. <em>Duḥ</em> stands for ‘difficulty’ and <em>kha</em> for
‘bearing up’. <strong>Even with difficulty one bears it up, and though one bears it
up, it is difficult</strong>.</p>
<p>Now regarding the question of existence we happened to mention that because of a
whirlpool’s activity, one can point out a ‘<strong>here</strong>’ with reference to it. We
can now come back to the word <em>itthattaṁ</em>, which we left out without comment in
the quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya</em></p>
<p>in so far only does the whirlpool whirl for the designation of an <em>itthatta.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is this <em>itthatta</em>? <em>Ittha</em> means ‘this’, so <em>itthattaṁ</em> would mean
‘this-ness’. The whirling of a whirlpool qualifies itself for a designation as a
‘this’.</p>
<p>There are a couple of verses in the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta
Nipāta</em> which bring out the meaning of this word more clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ye vajanti punappunaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>avijjāyeva sā gati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn67">21</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Taṇhā dutiyo puriso,</em> <br />
<em>dīgham addhāna saṁsāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁsāraṁ nātivattati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn68">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ye jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ punappunaṁ vajanti</em>,
“they that go on again and again the round of birth and death”.</p>
<p><em>Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ</em> “which is a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”, or “which
is an alternation between a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”.</p>
<p><em>Sā gati avijjāya eva</em>, “that going of them, that faring of them, is only a
journey of ignorance.”</p>
<p><em>Taṇhā dutiyo puriso</em>, “the man with craving as his second” (or his companion).</p>
<p><em>Dīgham addhāna saṁsāraṁ</em>, “faring on for a long time in <em>saṁsāra</em>”.</p>
<p><em>Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ, saṁsāraṁ nātivattati</em>, “does not get away from the
round which is a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”, or “which is an alternation
between a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”. What is meant by it, is the
transcendence of <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>We saw above how the concept of a ‘here’ arose with the birth of a whirlpool. In
fact one’s birth is at the same time the birth of a ‘here’ or ‘this place’. And
that is what is meant by <em>itthabhāva</em> in the two verses quoted above.
<em>Itthabhāva</em> and <em>itthatta</em> both mean ‘this-ness’. In both verses this
‘this-ness’ is coupled with an otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāva</em>.</p>
<p>Here too we see a conflict between two things, this-ness and otherwise-ness. The
cycle of <em>saṁsāra</em>, represented by birth and death, <em>jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ</em>, is
equivalent to an alternation between this-ness and otherwise-ness,
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāva</em>. And as the first verse says, this recurrent alternation
between this-ness and otherwise-ness is nothing but a journey of ignorance
itself.</p>
<p>Though we have given so much significance to the two terms <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, the commentary to the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> treats them lightly. It
explains <em>itthabhāvaṁ</em> as <em>imaṁ manussabhāvaṁ</em>, which means “this state as a
human being”, and <em>aññathābhāvaṁ</em> as <em>ito avasesa aññanikāyabhāvaṁ</em>, “any state
of being other than this”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn69">23</a></sup> This explanation misses the deeper
significance of the word <em>itthatta</em>.</p>
<p>In support of this we may refer to the <em>Pāṭikasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.
There we are told that when the world system gets destroyed at the end of an
aeon, some being or other gets reborn in an empty Brahma mansion, and after
being there for a long time, thinks, out of a feeling of loneliness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aho vata aññepi sattā itthattaṁ āgaccheyyuṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn70">24</a></sup></p>
<p>How nice it would be if other beings also come to this state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context the word <em>itthatta</em> refers to the Brahma world and not the human
world. From the point of view of the Brahmas, <em>itthatta</em> refers to the Brahma
world and only for us here, it means the human world.</p>
<p>However this is just a narrow meaning of the word <em>itthatta</em>. When the reference
is to the entire round of existence or <em>saṁsāra</em>, <em>itthatta</em> does not
necessarily mean ‘this human world’. The two terms have a generic sense, because
they represent some basic principle. As in the case of a whirlpool, this-ness is
to be seen together with an otherwise-ness. This illustrates the conflict
characteristic of existence. Wherever a this-ness arises, a possibility for an
otherwise-ness comes in. <em>Itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññathābhāva</em> go together.</p>
<p><em>Aniccatā</em>, or impermanence, is very often explained with the help of the phrase
<em>vipariṇāmaññathābhāva</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn71">25</a></sup> Now here too we have the word <em>aññathābhāva</em>.
Here the word preceding it, gives a clue to its true significance.</p>
<p><em>Vipariṇāma</em> is quite suggestive of a process of evolution. Strictly speaking,
<em>pariṇāma</em> is evolution, and <em>pariṇata</em> is the fully evolved or mature stage.
The prefix <em>vi</em> stands for the anti-climax. The evolution is over, now it is
becoming other. Ironically enough, this state of ‘becoming-other’ is known as
otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāva</em>. And so this twin, <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, tell us the nature of the world. Between them, they explain for
us the law of impermanence.</p>
<p>In the Section-of-the-Threes in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> the three characteristics
of a <em>saṅkhata</em> are explained in this order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṁ paññāyati</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn72">26</a></sup></p>
<p>an arising is manifest, a passing away is manifest and an otherwise-ness in
the persisting is manifest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that the persistence is only apparent and that is why it is
mentioned last. There is an otherwise-ness even in this apparently persistent.
But later scholars preferred to speak of three stages as <em>uppāda, ṭhiti,
bhaṅga</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn73">27</a></sup> “arising, persistence and breaking up”.</p>
<p>However the law of impermanence could be sufficiently understood even with the
help of two words, <em>itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññathābhāva</em>, this-ness and
otherwise-ness. Very often we find the Buddha summing up the law of impermanence
in the two words <em>samudaya</em> and <em>vaya</em>, ‘arising’ and ‘passing away’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn74">28</a></sup></p>
<p>There is an apparent contradiction in the phrase <em>ṭhitassa aññathatta</em>, but it
reminds us of the fact that what the world takes as static or persisting is
actually not so. The so-called ‘static’ is from beginning to end an
otherwise-ness. Now if we are to relate this to the two links <em>jāti</em> and
<em>jarāmaraṇaṁ</em> in <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, we may say that as soon as one is born the
process of otherwise-ness sets in. Wherever there is birth, there is death. One
of the traditional Pāli verses on the reflections on death has the following
meaningful lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uppattiyā sahevedaṁ, maraṇam āgataṁ sadā</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn75">29</a></sup></p>
<p>always death has come, even with the birth itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as in a conjoined pair, when one is drawn the other follows, even so when
birth is drawn in, decay-and-death follow as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Buddha, the world believed in the possibility of a
birth devoid of decay-and-death. It believed in a form of existence devoid of
grasping. Because of its ignorance of the pair-wise relatedness of this-to-that,
<em>idappaccayatā</em>, it went on with its deluded search. And that was the reason for
all the conflict in the world.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the Buddha, the concept of birth is equivalent to
the concept of a ‘here’. As a matter of fact, this birth of a ‘here’ is like the
first peg driven for the measurement of a world. Because of the pair-wise
relationship, the very first ‘<strong>birthday-present</strong>’ that one gets as soon as one
is born, is – <strong>death</strong>. The inevitable death that he is entitled to. This way
we can understand the deeper significance of the two words <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, this-ness and otherwise-ness.</p>
<p>We have to say the same thing with regard to the whirlpool. Apparently it has
the power to control, to hold sway. Seen from a distance, the whirlpool is a
centre of activity with some controlling power. Now, one of the basic meanings
of the concept of self is the ability to control, to hold sway. And a whirlpool
too, as seen from a distance, seems to have this ability. Just as it appears
automatic, so also it seems to have some power to control.</p>
<p>But on deeper analysis it reveals its <strong>not-self</strong> nature. What we have here is
simply the conflict between the main stream and a run-away current. It is the
outcome of the conflict between two forces and not the work of just one force.
It is a case of relatedness of this-to-that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>. As one verse in
the <em>Bālavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attā hi attano natthi</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn76">30</a></sup></p>
<p>even oneself is not one’s own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So even a whirlpool is not its own</strong>, there is nothing really automatic about
it. This then is the <em>dukkha</em>, the suffering, the conflict, the
unsatisfactoriness. What the world holds on to as existence is just a process of
otherwise-ness, as the Buddha vividly portrays for us in the following verses of
the <em>Nandavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayaṁ loko santāpajāto, phassapareto</em> <br />

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Just a few lines – but how deep they go!</strong> The world is in anguish and is
enslaved by contact. What it calls self is nothing but a disease.</p>
<p><em>Maññati</em> is a word of deeper significance. <em>Maññanā</em> is conceiving under the
influence of craving, conceit and views. Whatever becomes an object of that
conceiving, by that very conception it becomes otherwise. That is to say that an
opportunity arises for an otherwise-ness, even as ‘death’ has come together with
‘birth’.</p>
<p>So conceiving, or conception, is itself the reason for otherwise-ness. Before a
‘<strong>thing</strong>’ becomes ‘<strong>otherwise</strong>’, it has to become a ‘<strong>thing</strong>’. And it
becomes a ‘thing’ only when attention is focussed on it under the influence of
craving, conceit and views and it is separated from the whole world and grasped
as a ‘<strong>thing’</strong>. And that is why it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ yañhi lokasmim upādiyanti,</em> <br />
<em>teneva Māro anveti jantuṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn78">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever one grasps in the world, <br />
By that itself Māra pursues a being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world is attached to becoming and is fully given to becoming. Therefore its
very nature is otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāvī</em>.</p>
<p>And then the Buddha declares the inevitable outcome of this contradictory
position: <em>yad abhinandati taṁ bhayaṁ</em>, whatever one delights in, that is a
fear, that is a danger. What one delights in, is ‘becoming’ and that is a source
of fear. And <em>yassa bhāyati taṁ dukkhaṁ</em>, what one fears, or is afraid of, that
is suffering. And of what is one afraid? One is afraid of the otherwise-ness of
the thing that one holds on to as existing. So the otherwise-ness is the
suffering and the thing grasped is a source of fear.</p>
<p>For instance, when one is walking through a town with one’s pockets full of
gems, one is afraid because of the valuables in one’s pockets. Even so, the
existence that one delights in is a source of fear. What one fears is change or
otherwise-ness, and that is suffering. Therefore it is that this holy life is
lived for the abandonment of that very becoming or existence.</p>
<p>So from this quotation it becomes clear that the nature of existence is
‘otherwise-ness’. It is the insight into this nature that is basic in the
understanding of <em>idappaccayatā</em>. What is known as the arising of the
Dhamma-eye is the understanding of this predicament in worldly existence. But
that Dhamma-eye arises together with a solution for this predicament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn79">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as the arising aspect is concerned, this whirlpool is formed due to the
grasping through craving, conceit and views. Once this <em>saṁsāric</em> whirlpool is
formed, it keeps on attracting all that is in the world, all that is within its
reach, in the form of craving and grasping. But there is a cessation to this
process. It is possible to make it cease. Why? Because it is something arisen
due to causes and conditions. Because it is a process based on two things,
without a self to hold sway. That is why we have mentioned at the very outset
that everything is impermanent, prepared and dependently arisen, <em>aniccaṁ,
saṅkhataṁ, paṭicca samuppannaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Everyone of the twelve links in the formula, including ignorance, is dependently
arisen. They are all arisen due to causes and conditions, they are not
permanent, <em>aniccaṁ</em>. They are only made up or prepared, <em>saṅkhataṁ</em>. The word
<em>saṅkhataṁ</em> is explained in various ways. But in short it means something that
is made up, prepared, or concocted by way of intention.</p>
<p><em>Paṭicca samuppannaṁ</em> means conditionally arisen and therefore it is of a nature
to get destroyed, <em>khayadhamma</em>. It is of a nature to pass away, <em>vayadhamma</em>.
It is of a nature to fade away, <em>virāgadhamma</em>. It is of a nature to cease,
<em>nirodhadhamma</em>.</p>
<p>It seems that even the colour or shade of decay-and-death can fade away and that
is why we have pointed out their relevance to the question of concepts. This
nature of fading away is understood by one who has had an insight into the law
of arising and cessation.</p>
<p><em>Saṁsāra</em> is a whirlpool as far as the ordinary beings caught up in it are
concerned. Now what about the <em>arahants</em>? How is the idea of this whirlpool
presented in the case of the <em>arahants</em>? It is simply said that for them there
is no whirling round for there to be a designation: <em>vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi
paññāpanāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn80-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn80">34</a></sup> So in their case, there is no whirling round to justify a
designation.</p>
<p>This, then, is something deeper than the whirlpool itself. The whirlpool can be
pointed out because of its activity. But not so easily the emancipated ones and
that is why there is so much controversy regarding the nature of the
Tathāgata. The image of the whirlpool in its relation to the emancipated ones
is beautifully presented in the following verse from the <em>Cūḷavagga</em> of the
<em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchecchi vaṭṭaṁ byagā nirāsaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>visukkhā saritā na sandati,</em> <br />
<em>chinnaṁ vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>es’ ev’ anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn81">35</a></sup></p>
<p>He has cut off the whirlpool <br />
And reached desirelessness, <br />
The stream dried up now no longer flows. <br />
The whirlpool cut off whirls no more. <br />
This, even this, is suffering’s end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has the <em>arahant</em> done? He has cut off the whirlpool. He has breached it
and has reached the desireless state. The stream of craving is dried up and
flows no more. The whirlpool cut off at the root no more whirls. And this is the
end of suffering. The cutting off of the whirlpool is the realization of
cessation, which is <em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>It is because of the accent on the arising aspect that the current tries to move
against the main stream. When that attempt is given up, the rest happens as a
matter of course. This idea is even more clearly brought out by the following
two verses in the <em>Sagāthavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. They are in the form
of a dialogue between a deity and the Buddha. The deity asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kuto sarā nivattanti,</em> <br />
<em>kattha vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>kattha nāmañca rūpañca</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn82-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn82">36</a></sup></p>
<p>From where do currents turn back, <br />
Where whirls no more the whirlpool, <br />
Where is it that name-and-form <br />
Is held in check in a way complete?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha gives the answer in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>ato sarā nivattanti,</em> <br />
<em>ettha vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>ettha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati</em>.</p>
<p>Where earth and water, fire and wind no footing find, <br />
From there it is that currents turn back. <br />
There the whirlpool whirls no more <br />
And there it is that name-and-form <br />
Is held in check in a way complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference here is to Nibbāna. Whether it is called <em>sabbasaṅkhārasamatha</em>,
the stilling of all preparations, or <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>, the unprepared element,
it means the state of cessation. And when the <em>arahant’s</em> mind is in that state,
the four elements, which are like ghosts, do not haunt him. They do not get a
‘<strong>footing</strong>’ in that consciousness. When they fade away, due to detachment,
those currents do not flow and the whirlpool whirls no more. Name and form are
fully held in check there.</p>
<p>Now as far as the meaning of <em>rūpa</em> in <em>nāma-rūpa</em> in this reference is
concerned, its definition as <em>cattāri ca mahābhūtāni, catunnañca mahābhūtānaṁ
upādāyarūpaṁ</em> is quite significant .<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="sermon-02.html#fn-fn83">37</a></sup> It draws attention to the fact that
the four great primaries underlie the concept of form. This is something unique,
since before the advent of the Buddha the world thought that in order to get
away from <em>rūpa</em> one has to grasp <em>arūpa</em>. But the irony of the situation is
that, even in <em>arūpa</em>, <em>rūpa</em> is implicit in a subtle form. Or in other words,
<em>arūpa</em> takes <em>rūpa</em> for granted.</p>
<p>Supposing someone, walking in the darkness of the night, has a hallucination of
a devil and runs away to escape from it. He thinks he is running away from the
devil, but he is taking the devil with him. The devil is in his mind, it is
something imagined. Similarly, until the Buddha came into the scene, the
worldlings grasped <em>arūpa</em> in order to get away from <em>rūpa</em>. But because of the
dichotomy between <em>rūpa</em> and <em>arūpa</em>, even when they swung as far as the highest
formless realms, they were still in bondage to <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations. As
soon as the momentum of their swing of <em>saṅkhāras</em> got fully spent, they swung
back to <em>rūpa</em>. So here too we see the question of duality and dichotomy.</p>
<p>This sermon has served its purpose if it has drawn attention to the importance
of the questions of duality, dichotomy and the relatedness of this to that,
<em>idappaccayatā</em>. So this is enough for today.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>Today we have before us the third sermon on Nibbāna. The other day, with the
help of the simile of a whirlpool, we attempted an explanation of the terms
<em>saṁsāra</em> on the one hand, and Nibbāna on the other, that is to say ‘going
round’, or <em>saṁsaraṇa</em>, and ‘going out’, or <em>nissaraṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn85-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn85">2</a></sup> We also cited
suttas to illustrate both the arising (<em>samudaya</em>) and cessation (<em>nirodha</em>)
aspects of the law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>As regards this whirlpool, to show a parallel development with the links of the
law of dependent arising, by way of a sustained simile, we may say that the
ignorance in presuming that it is possible to go against the main stream of the
three signata – impermanence, suffering and not-self – is the place of its
origin. That heap of preparations impelled by ignorance, which takes the current
forward, may be regarded as <em>saṅkhāras</em>. And where the current in its progress
clashes with the main stream to become a whirlpool, that pushing forward against
the main stream is <em>viññāṇa</em> or consciousness.</p>
<p>The outcome of the clash is <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, or name-and-form, with its formal name
and nominal form. That link in the formula of dependent arising called
<em>saḷāyatana</em>, or six sense-bases, could be regarded as the outgrowth of this
name-and-form.We can understand that link, too, in relation to the simile of the
whirlpool. As the whirlpool goes on for a long time, an abyss is formed, the
functioning of which could be compared to the six sense-bases.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, bodily pains are comparable to an abyss. In a certain
sutta in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> the Buddha says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sārīrikānaṁ kho etaṁ bhikkhave dukkhānaṁ vedanānaṁ adhivacanaṁ, yadidaṁ
pātālo’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn86-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn86">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, abyss is a synonym for painful bodily feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When one comes to think about that statement, it would appear that the thirst of
craving arises in beings in various forms of existence because of painful
feeling. The <em>Sallattenasutta</em> adds to this by stating that the uninstructed
worldling, on being touched by painful feeling, delights in sense pleasures,
because he knows no way out of painful feeling other than the sense
pleasures.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn87-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn87">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In the light of that statement it seems that the abyss is the endless barrage of
painful feelings. The force of attraction that arises from the abyss is like the
thirst to quell those painful feelings. The grasping that follows is the
functioning of the same force of attraction. It attracts all the flotsam and
jetsam around it, as things organically appropriated, <em>upādinna</em>, to put up a
show of existence, or <em>bhava</em>. That is, a spot that can be pointed out with the
help of things thus grasped by the whirlpool. So this whirlpool or vortex simile
gives us some idea of the law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>The insight into the basic principle of dependent arising, is in fact regarded
as the arising of the ‘eye of Dhamma’. About the stream-winner it is said that
the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma has arisen in him. The following phrase,
which sums up the significance of that Dhamma-eye, comes up quite often in the
discourses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn88-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn88">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is briefly alluded to with the couple of terms <em>samudaya</em> and
<em>nirodha</em>, as <em>samudayo samudayo</em> and <em>nirodho nirodho</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn89-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn89">6</a></sup> It is as if the
experience of that insight has found expression as an exclamation: “Arising,
arising! Ceasing, ceasing!” The above phrase only connects up the two aspects of
that experience.</p>
<p>It seems then that what is called the ‘Dhamma-eye’, is the ability to see the
<em>Nibbānic</em> solution in the very vortex of the <em>saṁsāric</em> problem. That way of
analysis which puts <em>saṁsāra</em> and Nibbāna far apart, into two watertight
compartments, as it were, gives rise to interminable problems. But here we see
that, just as much as one could realize Nibbāna by discovering the cause of
suffering and following the path to its cessation, which in effect is the
understanding of the four noble truths, one could also put an end to this vortex
by understanding its cause and applying the correct means for its cessation.</p>
<p>In the previous sermon we happened to quote some Canonical verses, which
declared that the vortex does not exist for an <em>arahant</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn90-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn90">7</a></sup> Now as regards
the condition after the cessation of the vortex, if someone asks where the
vortex or the whirlpool has gone, what sort of answer can we give? It is the
same difficulty that comes up in answering the question: “Where has the fire
gone after it has gone out?” Because here too, what we call the whirlpool is
that current of water which went against the main stream. It also consists of
water, like the body of water outside it. So we cannot say that they united, nor
can we say that it went and hid somewhere.</p>
<p>Here we find ourselves in a queer situation. All we can say in fairness to truth
is that there had been a certain form of activity, a certain state of unrest,
due to certain causes and conditions. Because of that activity that was going on
there, it was possible to designate it, to give it a name. By worldly convention
one could refer to it as ‘that place’ or ‘this place’.</p>
<p>The entire field of activity was called a whirlpool by worldly convention. But
now, the so-called whirlpool is no more. The worldly convention is no more
applicable as in the case of an extinguished fire. The word ‘fire’ was
introduced, the concept of ‘fire’ was created, to designate a certain state of
affairs that arose due to causes and conditions, due to graspings. So from this
also we can see that it is in concepts that ignorance finds a camouflage.</p>
<p>Being unaware of it the world goes on amassing concepts and even expects to see
them in Nibbāna. There are some who fondly hope to get a vision of their lists
of concepts when they realize Nibbāna. But that wisdom penetrates through even
the concepts and that is why it is called <em>udayatthagāminī paññā ariyā
nibbedhikā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn91-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn91">8</a></sup> “the <em>ariyan</em> penetrative wisdom that sees the rise and
fall”.</p>
<p>The idea of penetration is already implicit in the phrase <em>yaṁ kiñci
samudayadhammaṁ sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>, “whatever is of a nature to arise,
all that is of a nature to cease”. If anything has the nature to arise, by that
very nature it is bound to come to its end. And that is why the wandering
ascetic Upatissa, who was to become Venerable Sāriputta later, attained the
fruit of a stream-winner even on hearing the first two lines of the verse
uttered by Venerable Assaji:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, tesaṁ hetuṁ tathāgato āha.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn92-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn92">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Of things that arise from a cause, their cause the Tathāgata has told.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a wise man hears that something has arisen due to causes and conditions, he
immediately understands that it could be made to cease by the removal of those
conditions, even without further explanation. It is the dustless stainless
Dhamma-eye that enables one to see the <em>Nibbānic</em> solution in the very
structure of the <em>saṁsāric</em> problem.</p>
<p>In our quotation from the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em> it was said that all pathways for
verbal expression, terminology and designation exist so long as the vortex of
<em>saṁsāra</em> is kept going.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn93-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn93">10</a></sup> The implication, therefore, is that they have no
existence beyond it. This is the significance of the word <em>ettāvatā</em>, “in so far
only”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ettāvatā jāyetha vā jīyetha vā mīyetha vā cavetha vā upapajjetha vā.</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn94-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn94">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In so far only can one be born, or grow old, or die, or pass away, or
reappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the concepts of birth, decay-and-death, passing away and reappearing, are
meaningful only in the context of the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex between consciousness
and name-and-form. If somehow or other this interrelation could be broken, this
<em>saṁsāric</em> vortex, the whirlpool, could be stopped, then, after that, nothing
remains to be said, nothing remains to be predicated. And as it is said in the
<em>Upasīvasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena naṁ vajju, taṁ tassa natthi</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn95-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn95">12</a></sup></p>
<p>that by which they would speak of him, that for him exists not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of Canonical passages that show us the relevance of this
vortex simile to the understanding of the doctrine of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. In
the <em>Mahāpadānasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> we find a lengthy description of the
manner in which the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī got an insight into <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em>. We are told that his mode of approach was one of radical reflection,
or <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, literally: “attention by way of the matrix”. One might
as well say that it is an attention by way of the vortex. It is as if a man with
keen vision, sitting under a tree by a river, were to watch how a fallen leaf
gets carried away by the water current, only to get whirled up and disappear in
a vortex.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated in the case of Vipassī <em>bodhisatta</em> that his understanding
through wisdom came as a result of ‘radical reflection’, <em>yoniso manasikārā ahu
paññāya abhisamayo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn96-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn96">13</a></sup> So his insight into <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> was
definitely not due to recollection of past lives. <em>Yoni</em> means the ‘matrix’, or
the ‘place of origin’. So in <em>yoniso manasikāra</em> always the attention has to
turn towards the place of origin.</p>
<p>So, true to this method, we find the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī starting his reasoning
from the very end of the <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kimhi nu kho sati jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, kiṁ paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ?</em></p>
<p>Given what, does decay-and-death come to be, from which condition comes
decay-and-death?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to this question, the following answer occurred to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jātiyā kho sati jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Given birth, does decay-and-death come to be, from birth as condition comes
decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same manner, taking pair by pair, he went on reasoning progressively. For
instance his next question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kimhi nu kho sati jāti hoti, kiṁ paccayā jāti?</em></p>
<p>Given what, does birth come to be, from which condition comes birth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer to it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhave kho sati jāti hoti, bhavapaccayā jāti</em>.</p>
<p>Given becoming, birth comes to be, from becoming as condition comes birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went on reasoning like this up to and including name-and-form. But when he
came to consciousness, he had to turn back. When he searched for the condition
of consciousness, he found that name-and-form itself is the condition, whereby
he understood their interdependence, and then he gave expression to the
significance of this discovery in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paccudāvattati kho idaṁ viññāṇaṁ nāmarūpamhā, nāparaṁ gacchati. Ettāvatā
jāyetha vā jīyetha vā mīyetha vā cavetha vā upapajjetha vā, yadidaṁ
nāmarūpapaccayā viññāṇaṁ, viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā
saḷāyatanaṁ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā
taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ, upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti,
jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti.
Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By means of radical reflection the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī understood that all
concepts of birth, decay-and-death converge on the relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This consciousness turns back from name-and-form, it does not go beyond. In so
far can one be born, or grow old, or die, or pass away, or reappear, in so far
as this is, namely: consciousness is dependent on name-and-form, and
name-and-form on consciousness; dependent on name-and-form, the six
sense-bases; dependent on the six sense-bases, contact; dependent on contact,
feeling; dependent on feeling, craving; dependent on craving, grasping;
dependent on grasping, becoming; dependent on becoming, birth; and dependent
on birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come
to be. Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that this understanding of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> signified the arising of
the Dhamma-eye in Vipassī <em>bodhisatta</em> is stated in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Samudayo samudayo’ti kho, bhikkhave, Vipassissa bodhisattassa pubbe
ananussutesu dhammesu cakkhum udapādi, ñāṇaṁ udapādi, paññā udapādi, vijjā
udapādi, āloko udapādi</em>.</p>
<p>‘Arising, arising’, thus, O! monks, in regard to things unheard of before,
there arose in the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom,
the science, the light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way it is said that the <em>bodhisatta</em> clarified for himself the
cessation aspect through radical reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kimhi nu kho asati jarāmaraṇaṁ na hoti, kissa nirodhā jarāmaraṇaṁ nirodho?</em></p>
<p>In the absence of what, will decay-and-death not be, with the cessation of
what, is the cessation of decay-and-death?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as the answer to it, the following thought occurred to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jātiyā kho asati jarāmaraṇaṁ na hoti, jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇaṁnirodho.</em></p>
<p>In the absence of birth, there is no decay-and-death, with the cessation of
birth is the cessation of decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise he went on reflecting progressively, until he reached the link between
name-and-form and consciousness, and then it occurred to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāmarūpanirodhā viññāṇanirodho, viññāṇanirodhā nāma-rūpanirodho.</em></p>
<p>From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of consciousness, from
the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once this vital link is broken, that is, when consciousness ceases with the
cessation of name-and-form, and name-and-form ceases with the cessation of
consciousness, then all the other links following name-and-form, such as the six
sense-bases, contact and feeling, come to cease immediately.</p>
<p>The <em>Mahāpadānasutta</em> goes on to say that the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī continued to
dwell seeing the arising and passing away of the five grasping groups and that
before long his mind was fully emancipated from the influxes and that he
attained to full enlightenment. It is also said in the sutta in this
connection that the <em>bodhisatta</em> followed this mode of reflection, because he
understood that it is the way of insight leading to awakening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Adhigato kho myāyaṁ vipassanā maggo bodhāya.</em></p>
<p>I have found this path of insight to awakening, to enlightenment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as we saw above the most important point, the pivotal point, in this path of
insight, is the relationship between name-and-form and consciousness. The
commentary raises the question, why the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī makes no mention
of the first two links, <em>avijjā</em> and <em>saṅkhārā</em>, and gives the explanation that
he could not see them, as they belong to the past.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn97-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn97">14</a></sup></p>
<p>But this is not the reason. The very ignorance regarding the relationship
between name-and-form and consciousness – is <em>avijjā</em>. And what accounts for the
continuity of this relationship – is <em>saṅkhārā</em>. It is because of these
preparations that the vortical interplay between consciousness and name-and-form
is kept going.</p>
<p>Simply because the first two links are not mentioned in the sutta, the
commentators give the explanation that they belong to the past. But it should be
clear that the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī could not have aroused the Dhamma-eye
without those two links. Why they are not specially mentioned here is because
they are in the background. It is true that there is a mode of exposition, in
which <em>avijjā</em>, or ignorance, takes precedence. But what we have here is a
different mode of exposition, according to which one has to stop short at the
interrelation between consciousness and name-and-form.</p>
<p>As to the cause of this mutual relationship, we have to go back to the vortex
simile. Usually, the progress of a current of water is visible at some distance
away from the vortex. In this case, the current of water forgets its own
impermanent, suffering and not-self nature, and goes ahead in search of a
permanent, pleasurable and self nature. And this itself – is <em>avijjā</em>, or
ignorance. This very tendency of the narrow water current to push on against the
main body of water, is itself what is called consciousness.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the context of the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual, what forms the
background for the interplay between consciousness and name-and-form, is the
non-understanding that the net result of the interplay is suffering, that it
only leads to suffering. In other words, it is the tendency to go ahead in
search of a state of permanence, pleasure and self, ignoring the three
characteristics of impermanence, suffering and not-self.</p>
<p>The heap of preparations or efforts arising out of that tendency are the
<em>saṅkhārās</em>. It is on these very preparations or efforts that consciousness
depends, and then we have name-and-form existing in relation to it. On the side
of name-and-form, or beyond it, we have all the other links of the <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em>. So in this way we can form a mental picture of the formula of
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> by some sort of a pictorial explanation. It seems, then,
that this discourse is further proof of the statements found in the
<em>Mahānidānasutta</em>.</p>
<p>There is yet another discourse, one preached by Venerable Sāriputta, which
supports our conclusions. It is found in the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>. There Venerable Sāriputta brings out a simile that is even simpler
than the vortex simile. He compares consciousness and name-and-form to two
bundles of reeds. When two bundles of reeds stand, one supporting the other, if
one of those is drawn out, the other would fall down. And if the latter is drawn
out, the former will fall down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ekaṁ ākaḍḍheyya, ekā papateyya, aparaṁ ce ākaḍḍheyya, aparā
papateyya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn98-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn98">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mutual interrelation between consciousness and name-and-form is like that of
two bundles of reeds, mutually supporting each other. Having given this simile,
Venerable Sāriputta goes on to mention the other links of the <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em> formula, as in the case of the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī’s insight. It
runs: “Dependent on name-and-form, the six sense-bases; dependent on the six
sense-bases, contact; dependent on contact, feelings” (and so on). And then the
cessation aspect of these links is also given.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, let us suppose that the consciousness bundle of reeds is
standing on the left side, and the name-and-form bundle is on the right. Then we
have a number of other bundles, such as the six sense-bases, contact and
feeling, all leaning on to the name-and-form bundle of reeds. These are all
dependent on the name-and-form bundle.</p>
<p>Now, as soon as the consciousness bundle is drawn out, all the others on the
right side fall down immediately. There is no interval. True to the qualities of
the Dhamma, summed up in the terms <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, <em>akālika</em> and <em>ehipassika</em>,
that is, to be seen here and now, not involving time, and inviting to come and
see, the entire mass of <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering ceases immediately. So, this
discourse is further proof of the fact that we have here quite a different state
of affairs, than what is commonly believed to be the significance of the
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> formula.</p>
<p>That is why we have pointed out that the concepts of birth, decay-and-death are
of the nature of fading away. That is also why decay-and-death have been
described as impermanent, made up, dependently arisen, of a nature to wither
away, pass away, fade away and cease:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccaṁ saṅkhataṁ paṭiccasamuppannaṁ khayadhammaṁ vayadhammaṁ virāgadhammaṁ
nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn99-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn99">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When one comes to think of it, one may find it difficult to understand why
decay-and-death are called impermanent and withering or decaying. But the reason
is that all concepts, in so far as they are leaning on to the name-and-form
bundle, have to fall down when the opposite bundle of reeds is drawn out. That
is to say that the entire mass of <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering ceases immediately, and
the whirlpool of <em>saṁsāra</em> comes to an end.</p>
<p>This, then, seems to be the most plausible conclusion. According to the
interpretation we have adopted, in the <em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> Venerable Sāriputta brings out as a quotation a certain
statement of the Buddha on <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo paṭiccasamuppādaṁ passati so dhammaṁ passati; yo dhammaṁ passati so
paṭiccasamuppādaṁ passati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn100-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn100">17</a></sup></p>
<p>He who sees the law of dependent arising, sees the Dhamma; he who sees the
Dhamma, sees the law of dependent arising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the quintessence of the Dhamma is in fact the law of dependent
arising itself. Now there are these six qualities of the Dhamma, summed up in
the well know formula, which every Buddhist believes in. This Dhamma is
well-preached, <em>svākkhāto</em>. It can be seen here and now, <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em>, that is,
one can see it by oneself here in this very world. It is timeless, <em>akāliko</em>. It
invites one to come and see, <em>ehipassiko</em>. It leads one on, <em>opanayiko</em>. It can
be realized by the wise each one by himself, <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo
viññūhi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn101-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn101">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Though we all have faith in these qualities of the Dhamma, let us see whether
the traditionally accepted interpretation of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is faithful to
these qualities, particularly to the two qualities <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em> and <em>akāliko</em>.</p>
<p>According to that accepted interpretation, presented by the venerable author of
the <em>Visuddhimagga</em>, the first two links of the formula belong to the past, and
the last two links belong to the future. The remaining eight links in the middle
are taken to represent the present.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn102-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn102">19</a></sup> That means, we have here the three
periods of time. So it is not – timeless.</p>
<p>And that is why they explained that the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī did not see the
first two links. Perhaps, the presumption is, that since these two links belong
to the past, they can be seen only by the knowledge of the recollection of past
lives. But on the other hand, the suttas tell us that even the stream-winner
has a clear understanding of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ariyo c’assa ñāyo paññāya sudiṭṭho hoti suppaṭividdho</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn103-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn103">20</a></sup></p>
<p>By him the Noble Norm is well seen and well penetrated through with wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘noble norm’ is none other than the law of dependent arising, and the
stream-winner has seen it well, penetrated into it well with wisdom. The prefix
<em>su-</em> implies the clarity of that vision. The question, then, is how a
stream-winner, who has no knowledge of the recollection of past lives, can get
this insight.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, the accepted interpretation, as already mentioned, puts the
first two links into the past. That is to say, ignorance and preparations are
referred to the past. Birth, decay-and-death are referred to the future. The
eight links in between are explained with reference to the present. Thus the
formula is divided into three periods.</p>
<p>Not only that, in the attempt to interpret the formula as referring to three
stages in the <em>saṁsāric</em> journey of an individual, additional links had to be
interposed to prop up the interpretation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn104-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn104">21</a></sup> Ignorance, preparations,
craving, grasping and becoming are regarded as the past causes. Depending on
these past causes, consciousness, name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact and
feeling are said to arise as results in the present. And again, with ignorance,
preparations, craving, grasping and becoming as present causes, consciousness,
name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact and feeling arise as results in the
future.</p>
<p>This kind of interpretation is also advanced. But this interpretation in terms
of pentads violates the interrelatedness between the twelve links in the
formula. We have already drawn attention to the fact of interrelation between
the two links in each pair. In fact, that itself has to be taken as the law of
dependent arising. That is the basic principle itself: Because of one, the other
arises. With its cessation, the other ceases. There is this mode of analysis,
but then it is disrupted by the attempt to smuggle in additional links into the
formula.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to this accepted commentarial exegesis, even the term
<em>bhava</em>, or becoming, is given a twofold interpretation. As
<em>kamma</em>-process-becoming and rebirth-process-becoming. In the context
<em>upādānapaccaya bhavo</em>, dependent on grasping is becoming, it is explained as
rebirth-process-becoming, while in the case of the other context, <em>bhavapaccaya
jāti</em>, dependent on becoming is birth, it is taken to mean
<em>kamma</em>-process-becoming. So the same term is explained in two ways. Similarly,
the term <em>jāti</em>, which generally means birth, is said to imply rebirth in the
context of the formula of dependent arising.</p>
<p>There are many such weak points in the accepted interpretation. Quite a number
of authoritative modern scholars have pointed this out. Now all these
short-comings could be side-tracked, if we grant the fact, as already mentioned,
that the secret of the entire <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex is traceable to the two links
consciousness and name-and-form. As a matter of fact, the purpose of the formula
of dependent arising is to show the way of arising and cessation of the entire
mass of suffering, and not to illustrate three stages in the <em>saṁsaric</em> journey
of an individual.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of this law of dependent arising is its demonstrability
in the present, as suggested by the terms ‘to be seen here and now’ and
‘timeless’, even as the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī discovered it, through radical
reflection itself. The salient characteristic of the teaching of the Buddha is
its visibility here and now and timelessness. This fact is well revealed by the
<em>Hemakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. The <em>brahmin</em> youth Hemaka sings praise
of the Buddha in the following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye me pubbe viyākaṁsu,</em> <br />
<em>huraṁ Gotamasāsanā,</em> <br />
<em>iccāsi iti bhavissati,</em> <br />
<em>sabbaṁ taṁ itihītihaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sabbaṁ taṁ takkavaḍḍhanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nāhaṁ tattha abhiramiṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Tvañca me dhammam akkhāhi,</em> <br />
<em>taṇhā nigghātanaṁ muni,</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ viditvā sato caraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tare loke visattikaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn105-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn105">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Those who explained to me before, <br />
Outside the dispensation of Gotama, <br />
All of them said: ‘so it was, and so it will be’, <br />
But all that is ‘so and so’ talk, <br />
All that is productive of logic, <br />
I did not delight therein.</p>
<p>But now to me, O! sage, <br />
Proclaim your Dhamma, <br />
That is destructive of craving, <br />
By knowing which and mindfully faring along, <br />
One might get beyond the world’s viscosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to paraphrase: Whatever teachers explained to me their teachings outside
your dispensation, used to bring in the past and the future in their
explanations, saying: “So it was, and so it will be.” That is, they were always
referring to a past and a future. But all that can be summed up as ‘so and so’
talk.</p>
<p>By the way, the term <em>itihītiha</em> had already become a technical term for
‘hearsay’ among the ascetics. Such teachings based on hearsay were productive of
logic, as for instance testified by the <em>Sabbāsavasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was I in the past, was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I

shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I become in the
future? (and so on)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn106-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn106">23</a></sup></p>

<p>“But, I was not pleased with such teachings”, says Hemaka, “It is only you, O!
sage, who teaches the Dhamma that destroys the craving in the present,
understanding which, and mindfully following it accordingly, one could go beyond
the sticky craving in the world.” Hemaka’s praise of the Buddha was inspired
by this most distinctive feature in the Dhamma.</p>
<p>We have already stated that by ‘Dhamma’ is meant the law of dependent arising.
This is further proof that the basic principle underlying the formula of
dependent arising could be traced to the constant relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form, already present in one’s mental continuum,
without running into the past or leaping towards the future.</p>
<p>We know that, in order to ascertain whether a banana trunk is pith-less, it is
not necessary to go on removing its bark, layer after layer, from top to bottom.
We only have to take a sharp sword and cut the trunk in the middle, so that the
cross-section will reveal to us its pith-less nature. Similarly, if we cut in
the middle the banana trunk of preparations with the sharp sword of wisdom,
<em>paññāmayaṁ tikhiṇamasiṁ gahetvā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn107-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn107">24</a></sup> its internal structure as revealed by
the cross-section will convince us of the essence-less nature of the group of
preparations.</p>
<p>Whatever existence there was in the past, that too had the same essence-less
nature. And whatever existence there will be in the future, will have this same
essencelessness. And I see it now, in my own mental continuum, as something
visible here and now, not involving time. It is with such a conviction that the
noble disciple utters the words: “Arising, arising! Cessation, cessation!” That
is how he arrives at the realization summed up in the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn108-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn108">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever is of the nature to arise, all that is of the nature to cease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this goes to show that the accepted interpretation has certain
short-comings.</p>
<p>To take up another simile, we have already alluded to the fact that the Buddha
has been compared to a physician.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn109-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn109">26</a></sup> Though this might well sound a
modernism, we may say that a specialist doctor today needs only a drop of blood
or blood tissue for a full diagnosis of a patient’s disease. When seen under the
microscope, that blood tissue reveals the pathological condition of the patient.
Even the patient himself could be invited to see for himself the result of the
blood test.</p>
<p>But once the disease has been cured, the doctor could invite the patient again
to undergo a blood test, if he likes to assure himself of the fact that that
disease has been effectively treated. The Buddha’s teaching has a similar ‘here
and now’ and timeless quality. What is noteworthy is that this quality is found
in the law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>Then there is another question that crops up out of this traditional
interpretation of the formula of dependent arising. That is, the reason why the
two links, ignorance and preparations, are referred to the past.</p>
<p>In some discourses, like the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em>, there is a discussion about a
descent of consciousness into a mother’s womb. Simply because there is such a
discussion, one might think that the law of dependent arising has reference to a
period beyond one’s conception in a mother’s womb.</p>
<p>But if we carefully examine the trend of this discussion and analyse its
purpose, such a conclusion will appear to be groundless. The point which the
Buddha was trying to drive home into Venerable Ānanda by his catechism, is
that the constant interrelation that exists between consciousness and
name-and-form is present even during one’s life in the mother’s womb. This
catechism can be analysed into four parts. The first question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ va hi, Ānanda, mātukucchismiṁ na okkamissatha, api nu kho nāmarūpaṁ
mātukucchismiṁ samuccissatha</em>?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn110-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn110">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Venerable Ānanda’s answer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No h’etaṁ, bhante</em>.</p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, consciousness were not to descend into a mother’s womb, would
name-and-form remain there?”</p>
<p>“It would not, Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha is asking whether name-and-form can persist in remaining inside the
mother’s womb, if consciousness refuses to descend into it, so to say. The word
<em>samuccissatha</em> presents a difficulty as regards etymology. But it is quite
likely that it has to do with the idea of remaining, as it has an affinity to
the word <em>ucciṭṭha</em>, left over, remnant.</p>
<p>So the point raised here is that, in the event of a non-descent of consciousness
into the mother’s womb, name-and-form will not be left remaining there.
Name-and-form has to have the support of consciousness. However, in this
interrelation, it is consciousness that decides the issue. If consciousness does
not descend, name-and-form will not remain there.</p>
<p>So even if, at the moment of death, one has a thought of some mother’s womb, if
consciousness does not descend in the proper manner, name-and-form cannot stay
there. Name-and-form has always to be understood in relation to consciousness.
It is not something that is to be found in trees and rocks. It always goes hand
in hand with consciousness. So, the upshot of the above discussion is that
name-and-form will not remain there without the support of consciousness.</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda’s response to the first question, then, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That indeed is not the case, O! Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ va hi, Ānanda, mātukucchismiṁ okkamitvā vokkamissatha, api nu kho
nāmarūpaṁ itthattāya abhinibbattissatha?</em></p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, consciousness, having descended into the mother’s womb, were to
slip out of it, would name-and-form be born into this state of existence?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda’s reply to it is again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That indeed is not the case, Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the question is: Ānanda, if for some reason or other, consciousness,
having descended into the mother’s womb, slips out of it, will name-and-form
secure birth as a this-ness, or <em>itthatta</em>. We have mentioned above that
<em>itthatta</em> is a term with some special significance.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn111-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn111">28</a></sup> That is, how a
‘there’ becomes a ‘here’, when a person takes birth in a particular form of
existence. In short, what it implies, is that a person comes to be born.</p>
<p>In other words, if consciousness, having descended into the mother’s womb, slips
out of it, that name-and-form will not mature into a this-ness and be born into
a this-ness. There is no possibility of the this-ness coming into being. For
there to be a this-ness, both consciousness and name-and-form must be there. We
can understand, then, why Venerable Ānanda replied in the negative.</p>
<p>The next question the Buddha puts, is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ va hi, Ānanda, daharasseva sato vocchijjissatha kumārakassa vā
kumārikāya vā, api nu kho nāmarūpaṁ vuddhiṁ virūḷhiṁ vepullaṁ āpajjissatha?</em></p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, the consciousness of a boy or a girl were cut off when he or
she is still young, will name-and-form come to growth and maturity?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To that question too, Venerable Ānanda replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That indeed is not the case, Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the preliminary questions have been correctly answered, the Buddha then
comes out with the following conclusion, since the necessary premises are
complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātih’Ānanda, es’ eva hetu etaṁ nidānaṁ esa samudayo esa paccayo
nāmarūpassa, yadidaṁ viññāṇaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Ānanda, this itself is the cause, this is the reason, origin and
condition for name-and-form, namely consciousness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is emphasized here, is the importance of consciousness. Out of the two,
namely consciousness and name-and-form, what carries more weight with it, is
consciousness, even if there be a trace of name-and-form. What the above
questionnaire makes clear, is that name-and-form arises in a mother’s womb
because of consciousness. But that name-and-form will not remain there, if
consciousness does not properly descend into the womb.</p>
<p>Also, if consciousness, after its descent, were to slip out, name-and-form will
not reach the state of a this-ness. So much so that, even after one’s birth as a
boy or girl, if consciousness gets cut off in some way or other, name-and-form
will not reach growth and maturity. So from all this, it is clear that
consciousness is an essential condition for there to be name-and-form. Then the
Buddha introduces the fourth step:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ va hi, Ānanda, nāmarūpe patiṭthaṁ na labhissatha, api no kho āyatiṁ
jātijarāmaraṇaṁ dukkhasamudayasambhavo paññāyetha?</em></p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, consciousness were not to find a footing, or get established
in, name-and-form, would there be an arising or origin of birth, decay, death
and suffering in the future?”</p>
<p>“No indeed, Lord”, says Venerable Ānanda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this fourth point is extremely important. What it implies is that, though
the aforesaid is the normal state of affairs in <em>saṁsāra</em>, if for some reason or
other consciousness does not get established on name-and-form, if at all such a
contrivance were possible, there will not be any <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering again. And
this position, too, Venerable Ānanda grants.</p>
<p>So from this discussion, too, it is obvious that, simply because there is a
reference to a mother’s womb in it, we cannot conclude that ignorance and
preparations are past causes. It only highlights the mutual relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form.</p>
<p>Now the question that comes up next is: “How does consciousness not get
established on name-and-form? In what respects does it not get established, and
how?”</p>
<p>The consciousness of a <em>saṁsāric</em> individual is always an established
consciousness. It is in the nature of this consciousness to find a footing on
name-and-form. These two go together. That is why in the <em>Sampasādanīyasutta</em> of
the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> it is mentioned in the discussion on the attainments to
vision, <em>dassanasamāpatti</em>, that a person with such an attainment sees a man’s
stream of consciousness that is not cut off on either side, established in this
world and in the next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Purisassa ca viññāṇasotaṁ pajānāti, ubhayato abbocchinnaṁ idha loke
patiṭṭhitañca para loke patiṭṭhitañca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn112-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn112">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is implied here is the established nature of consciousness. The
consciousness of a <em>saṁsāric</em> individual is established both in this world and
in the next.</p>
<p>Another attainment of vision, mentioned in the sutta, concerns the seeing of a
man’s stream of consciousness not cut off on either side, and not established in
this world or in the next. And that is a reference to the consciousness of an
<em>arahant</em>. So an <em>arahant’s</em> consciousness is an unestablished consciousness,
whereas the consciousness of the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual is an established
consciousness.</p>
<p>That is precisely why in the <em>Sagāthavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> and in the
<em>Sāratthapakāsinī</em>, where the episode of Venerable Godhika’s suicide is
mentioned, it is said that, though he cut his own neck intending to commit
suicide, he was able to attain <em>parinibbāna</em> as an <em>arahant</em> by radically
attending to the deadly pain.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn113-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn113">30</a></sup> But Māra took him to be an ordinary
person and hovered around in search of his consciousness – in vain. The Buddha,
on the other hand, declared that Venerable Godhika passed away with an
unestablished consciousness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Appatiṭṭhitena ca, bhikkhave, viññāṇena Godhiko kulaputto
parinibbuto</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn114-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn114">31</a></sup></p>
<p>O! monks, the clansman Godhika passed away with an unestablished
consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consciousness of an ordinary <em>saṁsāric</em> individual is always established.
The above mentioned relationship is always there. Because of this we can say
that there is always a knot in the consciousness of the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual.
For him, this world and the next world are tied together in a knot. In this
case, what is needed, is only the untying of the knot. There is no need of a
fresh tying up, as the knot is already there.</p>
<p>But the term <em>paṭisandhi viññāṇa</em>, or rebirth-linking-consciousness, is now so
widely used that we cannot help making use of it, even in relating a <em>Jātaka</em>
story. The idea is that, after the death-consciousness, there occurs a
rebirth-linking-consciousness.</p>
<p>However, some scholars even raise the question, why a term considered so
important is not to be found in the discourses. On many an occasion the Buddha
speaks about the descent into a womb. But apart from using such terms as
<em>okkanti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn115-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn115">32</a></sup> descent, <em>gabbhassa avakkanti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn116-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn116">33</a></sup> descent into a womb,
and <em>uppatti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn117-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn117">34</a></sup> arising, he does not seem to have used the term
<em>paṭisandhi</em>.</p>
<p>What is meant by this term <em>paṭisandhi</em>? It seems to imply a tying up of two
existences. After death there is a ‘relinking’. We have mentioned above, in
connection with the simile of the bundles of reeds that, when the consciousness
bundle of reeds is drawn, the name-and-form bundle of reeds falls. And when the
name-and-form bundle of reeds is drawn, the consciousness bundle of reeds falls.
And that there is a relationship of mutuality condition between them.</p>
<p>The question, then, is why a tying up is brought in, while granting the
relationship by mutuality condition. Because, going by the same simile, it would
be tantamount to saying that rebirth-linking-consciousness straightens up when
death-consciousness falls, as if, when one bundle of reeds is drawn, the other
straightens up. This contradicts the nature of mutuality condition. There is no
timelessness here. Therefore <em>paṭisandhi</em> is a term that needs critical
scrutiny.</p>
<p>The mental continuum of a <em>saṁsāric</em> being is always knotted with a tangle
within and a tangle without.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn118-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn118">35</a></sup> And it is already implicit in the
relationship between consciousness and name-and-form. What happens at the dying
moment is usually posed as a deep problem. But if we carefully examine the
situation in the light of Canonical discourses, we could see here an
illustration of the law of dependent arising itself.</p>
<p>Now as far as this established consciousness and the unestablished consciousness
are concerned, we have already drawn attention to the relationship between a
‘here’ and a ‘there’. We came across the term <em>itthatta</em>, otherwise called
<em>itthabhāva</em>.</p>
<p>As a rendering for it, we have used the term ‘this-ness’. And then we have
already pointed out that this <em>itthabhāva</em>, or this-ness, goes hand in hand with
<em>aññatthābhāva</em>, or otherwise-ness. That is to say, wherever a this-ness arises,
wherever a concept of a something arises, as a rule that itself is the setting
in of transformation or change.</p>
<p>This-ness and other-wiseness are therefore to be found in a pair-wise
combination. Wherever there is a this-ness, there itself is an otherwise-ness.
So in this way, because of the fact that, due to this this-ness itself, wherever
this-ness arises, otherwise-ness arises, together with it, wherever there is a
‘there’, there is always a ‘here’. This, then, is how the consciousness of the
<em>saṁsāric</em> being functions.</p>
<p>As far as one’s everyday life is concerned, what is called the conscious body,
is the body with consciousness. Generally we regard this body as something
really our own. Not only that, we can also objectify things outside us, beyond
our range of vision, things that are objects of thought or are imagined. That is
what is meant by the Canonical phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imasmiñca saviññāṇake kāye bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ahaṁkāra mamaṁkāra
mānānusayā na honti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn119-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn119">36</a></sup></p>
<p>There are no latencies to conceit by way of I-making and mine-making regarding
this conscious body and all outside signs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What it implies, is that one can have latencies to conceit by way of I-making
and mine-making regarding this conscious body as well as all outside signs. Now,
if we consider the deeper implications of this statement, we can get at some new
perspective for understanding the nature of the relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form.</p>
<p>If someone, deeply attached to a person who is not near him, but living
somewhere far far away, is heavily immersed in some deep thought, then, even if
there is some painful contact, such as the prick of a fly, or the bite of a
mosquito, or even if another comes and shakes him by the shoulder, he might not
feel it, because he is so immersed in the thought.</p>
<p>Now, why is that? Normally, the rightful place for consciousness is this body.
But what has happened now, is that it has gone away temporarily and united with
the name-and-form outside, with that object far away. But it can be awakened.
This is the way the mind travels.</p>
<p>It is due to a lack of clear understanding about the journey of the mind, that
the concept of a relinking-consciousness was found to be necessary. The way the
mind travels is quite different from the way the body travels. The journey of
the body is a case of leaving one place to go to another. But the mind’s journey
is not like that. It is a sort of whirling or turning round, as in the case of a
whirlpool or a vortex.</p>
<p>That is to say, just as in the case of a rubber-band which could be stretched
lengthwise or crosswise, there is a certain whirling round going on between
consciousness and name-and-form. It is because of that whirling motion, which
could either be circular or oval shaped, that consciousness and name-and-form
could either get drawn apart, or drawn in, as they go round and round in a kind
of vortical interplay.</p>
<p>So in a situation like the one mentioned above, for that person, the distant has
become near. At the start, when he fell to thinking, it was a ‘there’ for him.
Then it became a ‘here’. And the here became a ‘there’. This brings out, in a
subtle way, the relevance of these concepts to the question of understanding
such teachings as the law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>Concepts of a here and a there are in a way relative. They presuppose each
other. <em>Itthabhāva</em>, this-ness, and <em>aññathābhāva</em>, otherwise-ness, referred to
above, mean the same thing. <em>Itthabhāva</em> goes hand in hand with <em>aññathābhāva</em>.
They are bound in a pair-wise combination. When you drag in one, the other
follows of necessity. It is the same in the case of the relationship between
birth on the one hand, and decay-and-death on the other, as already mentioned.</p>
<p>Also, consciousness and name-and-form always move in an orbit. It is not
something like the journey of the body. Thought goes, but it rests on
consciousness, it gravitates towards consciousness. It is because consciousness
also has gone there that we say someone is ‘immersed’ or ‘engrossed’ in some
thought. It is consciousness that carries more weight.</p>
<p>This is sufficiently clear even from the Dhamma discussion of the Buddha,
quoted above. If consciousness does not descend into a mother’s womb,
name-and-form will not remain there. If consciousness does not join in to
provide the opportunity, it will not grow. This is the nature of the
relationship between them.</p>
<p>Though not well authenticated, cases have been reported of persons, on the verge
of death, going through such unusual experiences as visualizing their own body
from some outside standpoint. Taking into consideration the above mentioned
relationship, this is quite understandable. That external standpoint might not
be a place which has the ability to sustain that consciousness, or which is
capable of creating a new body out of the four primary elements. All the same,
it temporarily escapes and goes there and is now wavering to decide, whether or
not to come back to the body, as it were. It is on such occasions that one
visualizes one’s own body from outside.</p>
<p>So here we have the norm of the mind’s behaviour. Seen in this way, there is no
need for a fresh tying up, or relinking, because it is the same vortex that is
going on all the time. In the context of this <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex, the ‘there’
becomes a ‘here’, and a ‘here’ becomes a ‘there’. The distant becomes a near,
and a near becomes a distant.</p>
<p>It is owing to this state of affairs that the consciousness of the <em>saṁsāric</em>
individual is said to be always established. There is a certain twin character
about it. Whenever consciousness leaves this body for good, it goes and rests on
a name-and-form object which it had already taken up. In other words, this is
why the Buddha did not find it necessary to coin a new term to express the idea
of conception in some mother’s womb.</p>
<p>Consciousness has as its object name-and-form. It is precisely because of
consciousness that one can speak of it as a name-and-form. It is like the shadow
that falls on consciousness. Name-and-form is like an image.</p>
<p>Now in taking a photograph, there is a similar turn of events. Even if one does
not pose for the photograph with so much make-up, even if one turns one’s back
to the camera, at least a shade of his shape will be photographed as an image,
if not his form. Similarly, in the case of the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual, even if he
does not entertain an intention or thought construct, if he has at least the
latency, <em>anusaya</em>, that is enough for him to be reborn in some form of
existence or other.</p>
<p>That is why the Buddha has preached such an important discourse as the
<em>Cetanāsutta</em> of the <em>Nidāna Saṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yañca, bhikkhave, ceteti yañca pakappeti yañca anuseti, ārammaṇam etaṁ hoti
viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā. Ārammaṇe sati patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa hoti. Tasmiṁ patiṭṭhite

kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn120-1"><a href="sermon-03.html#fn-fn120">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatever one intends, whatever one mentally constructs, whatever lies
latent, that becomes an object for the stationing of consciousness. There
being an object, there comes to be an establishment of consciousness. When
that consciousness is established and grown, there is the descent of
name-and-form. Dependent on name-and-form the six sense-bases come to be;
dependent on the six sense-bases arises contact; and dependent on contact
arises feeling; dependent on feeling, craving; dependent on craving, grasping;
dependent on grasping, becoming; dependent on becoming, birth; dependent on
birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to
be. Such is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the second instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No ce, bhikkhave, ceteti no ce pakappeti, atha ce anuseti, ārammaṇam etaṁ
hoti viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā. Ārammaṇe sati patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa hoti. Tasmiṁ

jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti.
Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti</em>.</p>
<p>Monks, even if one does not intend or construct mentally, but has a latency,
that becomes an object for the stationing of consciousness. There being an
object, there comes to be the establishment of consciousness. When that
consciousness is established and grown, there is the descent of name-and-form.
Dependent on name-and-form the six sense-bases come to be; dependent on the
six sense-bases arises contact; and dependent on contact, feeling; dependent
on feeling, craving; dependent on craving, grasping; dependent on grasping,
becoming; dependent on becoming, birth; dependent on birth, decay-and-death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be. Such is the arising
of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significance of this second paragraph is that it speaks of a person who, at
the time of death, has no intentions or thought constructs as such. But he has
the latency. This itself is sufficient as an object for the stationing of
consciousness. It is as if he has turned his back to the camera, but got
photographed all the same, due to his very presence there. Now comes the third
instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, no ceva ceteti no ca pakappeti no ca anuseti,
ārammaṇam etaṁ na hoti viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā. Ārammaṇe asati patiṭthā viññāṇassa
na hoti. Tadappatiṭṭhite viññāṇe avirūḷhe nāmarūpassa avakkanti na hoti.

jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇaṁ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā nirujjhanti.
Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti</em>.</p>
<p>But, monks, when one neither intends, nor constructs mentally, and has no
latency either, then there is not that object for the stationing of
consciousness. There being no object, there is no establishment of
consciousness. When consciousness is not established and not grown up, there
is no descent of name-and-form, and with the cessation of name-and-form, there
comes to be the cessation of the six sense-bases; with the cessation of the
six sense-bases, the cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, the
cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, the cessation of craving;
with the cessation of craving, the cessation of grasping; with the cessation
of grasping, the cessation of becoming; with the cessation of becoming, the
cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, the cessation of
decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to cease.
Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This third instance is the most significant. In the first instance, there were
the intentions, thought constructs and latency. In the second instance, that
person had no intentions or thought constructs, but only latency was there. In
this third instances, there is neither an intention, nor a thought construct,
and not even a latency.</p>
<p>It is then that there comes to be no object for the stationing of consciousness.
There being no object, there is no establishment of consciousness, and when
consciousness is unestablished and not grown, there is no descent of
name-and-form. Where there is no descent of name-and-form, there at last comes
to be that cessation of name-and-form with which the six sense-bases, and all
the rest of it, down to the entire mass of <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering, cease
altogether then and there.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the last sermon, we were trying to explain how the process of
the <em>saṁsāric</em> journey of beings could be understood even with the couple of
terms <em>itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññatthābhāva</em>, or this-ness and otherwise-ness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn122-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn122">2</a></sup>
On an earlier occasion, we happened to quote the following verse in the <em>Sutta
Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṇhā dutiyo puriso,</em> <br />
<em>dīghamaddhāna saṁsāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁsāraṁ nātivattati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn123-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn123">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means: “The man with craving as his second”, or “as his companion”, “faring
on for a long time in <em>saṁsāra</em>, does not transcend the round, which is of the
nature of a this-ness and an otherwise-ness.”</p>
<p>This is further proof that the two terms imply a circuit. It is a circuit
between a ‘here’ and a ‘there’, or a ‘this-ness’ and an ‘otherwise-ness’. It is
a turning round, an alternation or a circuitous journey. It is like a rotation
on the spot. It is an ambivalence between a here and a there.</p>
<p>It is the relationship between this this-ness and otherwise-ness that we tried
to illustrate with quotations from the suttas. We mentioned in particular that
consciousness, when it leaves this body and gets well established on a
preconceived object, which in fact is its name-and-form object, that
name-and-form attains growth and maturity there itself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn124-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn124">4</a></sup> Obviously,
therefore, name-and-form is a necessary condition for the sustenance and growth
of consciousness in a mother’s womb.</p>
<p>It should be clearly understood that the passage of consciousness from here to a
mother’s womb is not a movement from one place to another, as in the case of the
body. In reality, it is only a difference of point of view, and not a
transmigration of a soul. In other words, when consciousness leaves this body
and comes to stay in a mother’s womb, when it is fully established there, ‘that’
place becomes a ‘this’ place. From the point of view of that consciousness, the
‘there’ becomes a ‘here’. Consequently, from the new point of view, what was
earlier a ‘here’, becomes a ‘there’. What was formerly ‘that place’ has now
become ‘this place’ and vice versa. That way, what actually is involved here, is
a change of point of view. So it does not mean completely leaving one place and
going to another, as is usually meant by the journey of an individual.</p>
<p>The process, then, is a sort of going round and round. This is all the more
clear by the Buddha’s statement that even consciousness is dependently arisen.
There are instances in which the view that this selfsame consciousness fares on
in <em>saṁsāra</em> by itself, <em>tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññaṁ</em>, is
refuted as a wrong view.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn125-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn125">5</a></sup></p>
<p>On the one hand, for the sustenance and growth of name-and-form in a mother’s
womb, consciousness is necessary. On the other hand, consciousness necessarily
requires an object for its stability. It could be some times an intention, or
else a thought construct. In the least, it needs a trace of latency, or
<em>anusaya</em>. This fact is clear enough from the sutta quotations we brought up
towards the end of the previous sermon. From the <em>Cetanāsutta</em>, we happened to
quote on an earlier occasion, it is obvious that at least a trace of latency is
necessary for the sustenance of consciousness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn126-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn126">6</a></sup></p>
<p>When consciousness gets established in a mother’s womb, with this condition in
the least, name-and-form begins to grow. It grows, at it were, with a flush of
branches, in the form of the six sense bases, to produce a fresh tree of
suffering. It is this idea that is voiced by the following well known verse in
the <em>Dhammapada</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathāpi mūle anupaddave daḷhe</em> <br />
<em>chinno pi rukkho punareva rūhati</em> <br />
<em>evam pi taṇhānusaye anūhate</em> <br />
<em>nibbattati dukkham idaṁ punappunaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn127-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn127">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as a tree, so long as its root is unharmed and firm, <br />
Though once cut down, will none the less grow up again, <br />
Even so, when craving’s latency is not yet rooted out, <br />
This suffering gets reborn again and again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from this verse too that the latency to craving holds a very
significant place in the context of the <em>saṁsāric</em> journey of a being. In the
<em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> one comes across the following statement by the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kammaṁ khettaṁ, viññāṇaṁ bījaṁ, taṇhā sineho</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn128-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn128">8</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Kamma</em> is the field, consciousness is the seed, craving is the moisture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in effect, means that consciousness grows in the field of <em>kamma</em> with
craving as the moisture.</p>
<p>It is in accordance with this idea and in the context of this particular simile
that we have to interpret the reply of Selā Therī to a question raised by
Māra. In the <em>Sagātha Vagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> one comes across the
following riddle put by Māra to the <em>arahant</em> nun Selā:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ken’idaṁ pakataṁ bimbaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ko nu bimbassa kārako,</em> <br />
<em>kvannu bimbaṁ samuppannaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kvannu bimbaṁ nirujjhati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn129-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn129">9</a></sup></p>
<p>By whom was this image wrought, <br />
Who is the maker of this image, <br />
Where has this image arisen, <br />
And where does the image cease?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image meant here is one’s body, or one’s outward appearance which, for the
conventional world, is name-and-form. Selā Therī gives her answer in three
verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nayidaṁ attakataṁ bimbaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nayidaṁ parakataṁ aghaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>hetuṁ paṭicca sambhūtaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>hetubhaṅgā nirujjhati.</em></p>
<p><em>Yathā aññataraṁ bījaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>khette vuttaṁ virūhati,</em> <br />
<em>pathavīrasañcāgamma,</em> <br />
<em>sinehañca tadūbhayaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ khandhā ca dhātuyo,</em> <br />
<em>cha ca āyatanā ime,</em> <br />
<em>hetuṁ paṭicca sambhūtā,</em> <br />
<em>hetubhaṅgā nirujjhare.</em></p>
<p>Neither self-wrought is this image, <br />
Nor yet other-wrought is this misery, <br />
By reason of a cause, it came to be, <br />
By breaking up the cause, it ceases to be.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of a certain seed, <br />
Which when sown on the field would feed <br />
On the taste of the earth and moisture, <br />
And by these two would grow.</p>
<p>Even so, all these aggregates <br />
Elements and bases six, <br />
By reason of a cause have come to be, <br />
By breaking up the cause will cease to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first verse negates the idea of creation and expresses the conditionally
arisen nature of this body. The simile given in the second verse illustrates
this law of dependent arising. It may be pointed out that this simile is not one
chosen at random. It echoes the idea behind the Buddha’s statement already
quoted, <em>kammaṁ khettaṁ, viññāṇaṁ bījaṁ, taṇhā sineho</em>. <em>Kamma</em> is the field,
consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture.</p>
<p>Here the venerable Therī is replying from the point of view of Dhamma, which
takes into account the mental aspect as well. It is not simply the outward
visible image, as commonly understood by <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, but that image which falls
on consciousness as its object. The reason for the arising and growth of
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> is therefore the seed of consciousness. That consciousness seed
grows in the field of <em>kamma</em>, with craving as the moisture. The outgrowth is in
terms of aggregates, elements and bases. The cessation of consciousness is none
other than Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Some seem to think that the cessation of consciousness occurs in an <em>arahant</em>
only at the moment of his <em>parinibbāna</em>, at the end of his life span. But this
is not the case. Very often, the deeper meanings of important suttas have been
obliterated by the tendency to interpret the references to consciousness in such
contexts as the final occurrence of consciousness in an <em>arahant’s</em> life –
<em>carimaka viññāṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn130-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn130">10</a></sup></p>
<p>What is called the cessation of consciousness has a deeper sense here. It means
the cessation of the specifically prepared consciousness, <em>abhisaṅkhata
viññāṇa</em>. An <em>arahant’s</em> experience of the cessation of consciousness is at the
same time the experience of the cessation of name-and-form. Therefore, we can
attribute a deeper significance to the above verses.</p>
<p>In support of this interpretation, we can quote the following verse in the
<em>Munisutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saṅkhāya vatthūni pamāya bījaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sineham assa nānuppavecche,</em> <br />
<em>sa ve munī jātikhayantadassī,</em> <br />
<em>takkaṁ pahāya na upeti saṅkhaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn131-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn131">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Having surveyed the field and measured the seed, <br />
He waters it not for moisture, <br />
That sage in full view of birth’s end, <br />
Lets go of logic and comes not within reckoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By virtue of his masterly knowledge of the fields and his estimate of the seed
of consciousness, he does not moisten it with craving. Thereby he sees the end
of birth and transcends logic and worldly convention. This too shows that the
deeper implications of the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em>, concerning the descent of
consciousness into the mother’s womb, have not been sufficiently appreciated so
far.</p>
<p><em>Anusaya</em>, or latency, is a word of special significance. What is responsible
for rebirth, or <em>punabbhava</em>, is craving, which very often has the epithet
<em>ponobhavikā</em> attached to it. The latency to craving is particularly
instrumental in giving one yet another birth to fare on in <em>saṁsāra</em>. There is
also a tendency to ignorance, which forms the basis of the latency to craving.
It is the tendency to get attached to worldly concepts, without understanding
them for what they are. That tendency is a result of ignorance in the worldlings
and it is in itself a latency. In the sutta terminology the word <em>nissaya</em> is
often used to denote it. The cognate word <em>nissita</em> is also used alongside. It
means ‘one who associates something’, while <em>nissaya</em> means ‘association’.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, here it does not have the same sense as the word has in its
common usage. It goes deeper, to convey the idea of ‘leaning on’ something.
Leaning on is also a form of association. Worldlings have a tendency to
tenaciously grasp the concepts in worldly usage, to cling to them dogmatically
and lean on them. They believe that the words they use have a reality of their
own, that they are categorically true in their own right. Their attitude towards
concepts is tinctured by craving, conceit and views.</p>
<p>We come across this word <em>nissita</em> in quite a number of important suttas. It
almost sounds like a topic of meditation. In the <em>Channovādasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> there is a cryptic passage, which at a glance looks more or
less like a riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nissitassa calitaṁ, anissitassa calitaṁ natthi. Calite asati passaddhi,
passaddhiyā sati nati na hoti, natiyā asati āgatigati na hoti, āgatigatiyā
asati cutūpapāto na hoti, cutūpapāte asati nev’idha na huraṁ na ubhayamantare.
Es’ ev’ anto dukhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn132-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn132">12</a></sup></p>
<p>To the one attached, there is wavering. To the unattached one, there is no
wavering. When there is no wavering, there is calm. When there is calm, there
is no inclination. When there is no inclination, there is no coming and going.
When there is no coming and going, there is no death and birth. When there is
no death and birth, there is neither a ‘here’ nor a ‘there’ nor a ‘between the
two’. This itself is the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks as if the ending of suffering is easy enough. On the face of it, the
passage seems to convey this much. To the one who leans on something, there is
wavering or movement. He is perturbable. Though the first sentence speaks about
the one attached, the rest of the passage is about the unattached one. That is
to say, the one released.</p>
<p>So here we see the distinction between the two. The one attached is movable,
whereas the unattached one is not. When there is no wavering or perturbation,
there is calm. When there is calm, there is no inclination. The word <em>nati</em>
usually means ‘bending’. So when there is calm, there is no bending or
inclination. When there is no bending or inclination, there is no coming and
going. When there is no coming and going, there is no passing away or
reappearing. When there is neither a passing away nor a reappearing, there is
neither a ‘here’, nor a ‘there’, nor any position in between. This itself is the
end of suffering.</p>
<p>The sutta passage, at a glance, appears like a jumble of words. It starts by
saying something about the one attached, <em>nissita</em>. It is limited to just one
sentence: ‘To one attached, there is wavering.’ But we can infer that, due to
his wavering and unsteadiness or restlessness, there is inclination, <em>nati</em>. The
key word of the passage is <em>nati</em>. Because of that inclination or bent, there is
a coming and going. Given the twin concept of coming and going, there is the
dichotomy between passing away and reappearing, <em>cuti/uppatti</em>. When these two
are there, the two concepts ‘here’ and ‘there’ also come in. And there is a
‘between the two’ as well. Wherever there are two ends, there is also a middle.
So it seems that in this particular context the word <em>nati</em> has a special
significance.</p>
<p>The person who is attached is quite unlike the released person. Because he is
not released, he always has a forward bent or inclination. In fact, this is the
nature of craving. It bends one forward. In some suttas dealing with the
question of rebirth, such as the <em>Kutūhalasālāsutta</em>, craving itself is
sometimes called the grasping, <em>upādāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn133-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn133">13</a></sup> So it is due to this very
inclination or bent that the two concepts of coming and going, come in. Then, in
accordance with them, the two concepts of passing away and reappearing, fall
into place.</p>
<p>The idea of a journey, when viewed in the context of <em>saṁsāra</em>, gives rise to
the idea of passing away and reappearing. Going and coming are similar to
passing away and reappearing. So then, there is the implication of two places,
all this indicates an attachment. There is a certain dichotomy about the terms
here and there, and passing away and reappearing. Due to that dichotomous nature
of the concepts, which beings tenaciously hold on to, the journeying in
<em>saṁsāra</em> takes place in accordance with craving. As we have mentioned above, an
alternation or transition occurs.</p>
<p>As for the released person, about whom the passage is specially concerned, his
mind is free from all those conditions. To the unattached, there is no wavering.
Since he has no wavering or unsteadiness, he has no inclination. As he has no
inclination, there is no coming and going for him. As there is no coming and
going, he has no passing away or reappearing. There being no passing away or
reappearing, there is neither a here, nor a there, nor any in between. That
itself is the end of suffering.</p>
<p>The <em>Udāna</em> version of the above passage has something significant about it.
There the entire sutta consists of these few sentences. But the introductory
part of it says that the Buddha was instructing, inciting and gladdening the
monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbāna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tena kho pana samayena Bhagavā bhikkhū nibbānapaṭisaṁyuttāya dhammiyā kathāya
sandasseti samādapeti samuttejeti sampahaṁseti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn134-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn134">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer to the fact that this sermon is on Nibbāna. So the
implication is that in Nibbāna the <em>arahant’s</em> mind is free from any
attachments.</p>
<p>There is a discourse in the <em>Nidāna</em> section of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, which
affords us a deeper insight into the meaning of the word <em>nissaya</em>. It is the
<em>Kaccāyanagottasutta</em>, which is also significant for its deeper analysis of
right view. This is how the Buddha introduces the sermon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvayanissito khvāyaṁ, Kaccāyana, loko yebhuyyena: atthitañceva natthitañca.
Lokasamudayaṁ kho, Kaccāyana, yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya passato yā loke
natthitā sā na hoti. Lokanirodhaṁ kho, Kaccāyana, yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
passato yā loke atthitā sā na hoti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn135-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn135">15</a></sup></p>
<p>This world, Kaccāyana, for the most part, bases its views on two things: on
existence and non-existence. Now, Kaccāyana, to one who with right wisdom
sees the arising of the world as it is, the view of non-existence regarding
the world does not occur. And to one who with right wisdom sees the cessation
of the world as it really is, the view of existence regarding the world does
not occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha comes out with this discourse in answer to the following question
raised by the <em>brahmin</em> Kaccāyana:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sammā diṭṭhi, sammā diṭṭhī’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante,
sammā diṭṭhi hoti?</em></p>
<p>Lord, ‘right view’, ‘right view’, they say. But how far, Lord, is there ‘right
view’?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his answer, the Buddha first points out that the worldlings mostly base
themselves on a duality, the two conflicting views of existence and
non-existence, or ‘is’ and ‘is not’. They would either hold on to the dogmatic
view of eternalism, or would cling to nihilism. Now as to the right view of the
noble disciple, it takes into account the process of arising as well as the
process of cessation, and thereby avoids both extremes. This is the insight that
illuminates the middle path.</p>
<p>Then the Buddha goes on to give a more detailed explanation of right view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Upayupādānābhinivesavinibandho khvāyaṁ, Kaccāyana, loko yebhuyyena. Tañcāyaṁ
upayupādānaṁ cetaso adhiṭṭhānaṁ abhinivesānusayaṁ na upeti na upādiyati
nādhiṭṭhāti: ’attā me’ti. ‘Dukkham eva uppajjamānaṁ uppajjati, dukkhaṁ
nirujjhamānaṁ nirujjhatī’ti na kaṅkhati na vicikicchati aparapaccayā ñāṇam ev’
assa ettha hoti. Ettāvatā kho, Kaccāyana, sammā diṭṭhi hoti.</em></p>
<p>The world, Kaccāyana, for the most part, is given to approaching, grasping,
entering into and getting entangled as regards views. Whoever does not
approach, grasp, and take his stand upon that proclivity towards approaching
and grasping, that mental standpoint, namely the idea: ‘This is my soul’, he
knows that what arises is just suffering and what ceases is just suffering.
Thus, he is not in doubt, is not perplexed, and herein he has the knowledge
that is not dependent on another. Thus far, Kaccāyana, he has right view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The passage starts with a string of terms which has a deep philosophical
significance. <em>Upaya</em> means ‘approaching’, <em>upādāna</em> is ‘grasping’, <em>abhinivesa</em>
is ‘entering into’, and <em>vinibandha</em> is the consequent entanglement. The
implication is that the worldling is prone to dogmatic involvement in concepts
through the stages mentioned above in an ascending order.</p>
<p>The attitude of the noble disciple is then outlined in contrast to the above
dogmatic approach, and what follows after it. As for him, he does not approach,
grasp, or take up the standpoint of a self.</p>
<p>The word <em>anusaya</em>, latency or ‘lying dormant’, is also brought in here to show
that even the proclivity towards such a dogmatic involvement with a soul or
self, is not there in the noble disciple. But what, then, is his point of view?
What arises and ceases is nothing but suffering. There is no soul or self to
lose, it is only a question of arising and ceasing of suffering. This, then, is
the right view.</p>
<p>Thereafter the Buddha summarizes the discourse and brings it to a climax with an
impressive declaration of his via media, the middle path based on the formula of
dependent arising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Sabbam atthī’ti kho, Kaccāyana, ayam eko anto. ’Sabbaṁ natthī’ti ayaṁ dutiyo
anto. Ete te, Kaccāyana, ubho ante anupagamma majjhena Tathāgato Dhammaṁ
deseti:</em></p>
<p><em>Avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṁ, viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ,
nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṁ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā,
vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ, upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā
jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti.
Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti.</em></p>
<p><em>Avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho, saṅkharanirodhā

sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā nirujjhanti. Evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti</em>.</p>
<p>‘Everything exists’, Kaccāyana, is one extreme. ‘Nothing exists’ is the
other extreme. Not approaching either of those extremes, Kaccāyana, the
Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle way:</p>
<p>From ignorance as condition, preparations come to be; from preparations as
condition, consciousness comes to be; from consciousness as condition,
name-and-form comes to be; from name-and-form as condition, the six
sense-bases come to be; from the six sense-bases as condition, contact comes
to be; from contact as condition, feeling comes to be; from feeling as
condition, craving comes to be; from craving as condition, grasping comes to
be; from grasping as condition, becoming comes to be; from becoming as
condition, birth comes to be; and from birth as condition, decay-and-death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be. Such is the arising
of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p>From the complete fading away and cessation of that very ignorance, there
comes to be the cessation of preparations; from the cessation of preparations,
there comes to be the cessation of consciousness; from the cessation of
consciousness, there comes to be the cessation of name-and-form; from the
cessation of name-and-form, there comes to be the cessation of the six
sense-bases; from the cessation of the six sense-bases, there comes to be the
cessation of contact; from the cessation of contact, there comes to be the
cessation of feeling; from the cessation of feeling, there comes to be the
cessation of craving; from the cessation of craving, there comes to be the
cessation of grasping; from the cessation of grasping, there comes to be the
cessation of becoming; from the cessation of becoming, there comes to be the
cessation of birth; and from the cessation of birth, there comes to be the
cessation of decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair.
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from this declaration that in this context the law of dependent
arising itself is called the middle path. Some prefer to call this the Buddha’s
metaphysical middle path, as it avoids both extremes of ‘is’ and ‘is not’. The
philosophical implications of the above passage lead to the conclusion that the
law of dependent arising enshrines a certain pragmatic principle, which
dissolves the antinomian conflict in the world.</p>
<p>It is the insight into this principle that basically distinguishes the noble
disciple, who sums it up in the two words <em>samudayo</em>, arising, and <em>nirodho</em>,
ceasing. The arising and ceasing of the world is for him a fact of experience, a
knowledge. It is in this light that we have to understand the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>aparappaccayā ñāṇam ev’assa ettha hoti</em></p>
<p>herein he has a knowledge that is not dependent on another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, he is not believing in it out of faith in someone, but has
understood it experientially. The noble disciple sees the arising and the
cessation of the world through his own six sense bases.</p>
<p>In the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> there is a verse which presents this idea in a striking
manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chasu loko samuppanno,</em> <br />
<em>chasu kubbati santhavaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>channam eva upādāya,</em> <br />
<em>chasu loko vihaññati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn136-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn136">16</a></sup></p>
<p>In the six the world arose, <br />
In the six it holds concourse, <br />
On the six themselves depending, <br />
In the six it has its woes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse seems to say that the world has arisen in the six, that it has
associations in the six, and that depending on those very six, the world comes
to grief.</p>
<p>Though the commentators advance an interpretation of this six, it does not seem
to get the sanction of the sutta as it is. According to them, the first line
speaks of the six internal sense bases, such as the eye, ear and nose.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn137-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn137">17</a></sup>
The world is said to arise in these six internal sense bases. The second line is
supposed to refer to the six external sense bases. Again the third line is
interpreted with reference to the six internal sense bases, and the fourth line
is said to refer to the six external sense bases.</p>
<p>In other words, the implication is that the world arises in the six internal
sense bases and associates with the six external sense bases, and that it holds
on to the six internal sense bases and comes to grief in the six external sense
bases.</p>
<p>This interpretation seems to miss the point. Even the grammar does not allow it,
for if it is a case of associating ‘with’ the external sense bases, the
instrumental case would have been used instead of the locative case, that is,
<em>chahi</em> instead of <em>chasu</em>. On the other hand, the locative <em>chasu</em> occurs in
all the three lines in question. This makes it implausible that the first two
lines are referring to two different groups of sixes.</p>
<p>It is more plausible to conclude that the reference is to the six sense bases of
contact, <em>phassāyatana</em>, which include both the internal and the external. In
fact, at least two are necessary for something to be dependently arisen. The
world does not arise in the six internal bases in isolation. It is precisely in
this fact that the depth of this Dhamma is to be seen.</p>
<p>In the <em>Samudayasutta</em> of the <em>Saḷāyatana</em> section in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> this
aspect of dependent arising is clearly brought out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati phasso,
phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ,
upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti. Evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn138-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn138">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Dependent on the eye and forms arises eye consciousness; the coming together
of the three is contact; with contact as condition, arises feeling;
conditioned by feeling , craving; conditioned by craving, grasping;
conditioned by grasping, becoming; conditioned by becoming, birth; and
conditioned by birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
despair. Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the sutta starts with the arising of contact and branches off towards the
standard formula of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. Eye consciousness arises dependent on,
<em>paṭicca</em>, two things, namely eye and forms. And the concurrence of the three is
contact. This shows that two are necessary for a thing to be dependently arisen.</p>
<p>So in fairness to the sutta version, we have to conclude that the reference in
all the four lines is to the bases of contact, comprising both the internal and
the external. That is to say, we cannot discriminate between them and assert
that the first line refers to one set of six, and the second line refers to
another. We are forced to such a conclusion in fairness to the sutta.</p>
<p>So from this verse also we can see that according to the usage of the noble ones
the world arises in the six sense bases. This fact is quite often expressed by
the phrase <em>ariyassa vinaye loko</em>, the world in the noble one’s
discipline.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn139-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn139">19</a></sup> According to this noble usage, the world is always defined
in terms of the six sense bases, as if the world arises because of these six
sense bases. This is a very deep idea. All other teachings in this Dhamma will
get obscured, if one fails to understand this basic fact, namely how the concept
of the world is defined in this mode of noble usage.</p>
<p>This noble usage reveals to us the implications of the expression
<em>udayatthagāminī paññā</em>, the wisdom that sees the rise and fall. About the noble
disciple it is said that he is endowed with the noble penetrative wisdom of
seeing the rise and fall, <em>udayatthagāminiyā paññāya sammanāgato ariyāya
nibbhedikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn140-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn140">20</a></sup> The implication is that this noble wisdom has a
penetrative quality about it. This penetration is through the rigidly grasped
almost impenetrable encrustation of the two dogmatic views in the world,
existence and non-existence.</p>
<p>Now, how does that penetration come about? As already stated in the above quoted
<em>Kaccāyanasutta</em>, when one sees the arising aspect of the world, one finds it
impossible to hold the view that nothing exists in the world. His mind does not
incline towards a dogmatic involvement with that view. Similarly, when he sees
the cessation of the world through his own six sense bases, he sees no
possibility to go to the other extreme view in the world: ‘Everything exists’.</p>
<p>The most basic feature of this principle of dependent arising, with its
penetrative quality, is the breaking down of the power of the above concepts. It
is the very inability to grasp these views dogmatically that is spoken of as the
abandonment of the personality view, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>. The ordinary worldling is
under the impression that things exist in truth and fact, but the noble
disciple, because of his insight into the norm of arising and cessation,
understands the arising and ceasing nature of concepts and their essencelessness
or insubstantiality.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the same thing, in addition to what has already been said
about <em>nissaya</em>, is the understanding of the relatedness of this to that,
<em>idappaccayatā</em>, implicit in the law of dependent arising. In fact, we began our
discussion by highlighting the significance of the term <em>idappaccayatā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn141-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn141">21</a></sup>
The basic principle involved, is itself often called <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This being, this comes to be, with the arising of this, this arises. This not
being, this does not come to be. With the cessation of this, this ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This insight penetrates through those extreme views. It resolves the conflict
between them. But how? By removing the very premise on which it rested, and that
is that there are two things. Though logicians might come out with the law of
identity and the like, according to right view, the very bifurcation itself is
the outcome of a wrong view. That is to say, this is only a conjoined pair. In
other words, it resolves that conflict by accepting the worldly norm.</p>
<p>Now this is a point well worth considering. In the case of the twelve links of
the formula of dependent arising, discovered by the Buddha, there is a
relatedness of this to that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>.</p>
<p>As for instance already illustrated above by the two links birth and
decay-and-death.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn142-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn142">22</a></sup> When birth is there, decay-and-death come to be, with
the arising of birth, decay-and-death arise (and so on). The fact that this
relatedness itself is the eternal law, is clearly revealed by the following
statement of the Buddha in the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Avijjāpaccayā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā. Ya tatra tathatā avitathatā anaññathatā
idappaccayatā, ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, paṭiccasamuppādo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn143-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn143">23</a></sup></p>
<p>From ignorance as condition, preparations come to be. That suchness therein,
the invariability, the not-otherwiseness, the relatedness of this to that,
this, monks, is called dependent arising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the first two links have been taken up to illustrate the principle
governing their direct relation. Now let us examine the meaning of the terms
used to express that relation. <em>Tathā</em> means ‘such’ or ‘thus’, and is suggestive
of the term <em>yathābhūtañāṇadassana</em>, the knowledge and vision of things as they
are. The correlatives <em>yathā</em> and <em>tathā</em> express between them the idea of
faithfulness to the nature of the world.</p>
<p>So <em>tathatā</em> asserts the validity of the law of dependent arising, as a norm in
accordance with nature. <em>Avitathatā</em>, with its double negative, reaffirms that
validity to the degree of invariability. <em>Anaññathatā</em>, or not-otherwiseness,
makes it unchallengeable, as it were. It is a norm beyond contradiction.</p>
<p>When a conjoined pair is accepted as such, there is no conflict between the two.
But since this idea can well appear as some sort of a puzzle, we shall try to
illustrate it with a simile. Suppose two bulls, a black one and a white one, are
bound together at the neck and allowed to graze in the field as a pair. This is
sometimes done to prevent them from straying far afield. Now out of the pair, if
the white bull pulls towards the stream, while the black one is pulling towards
the field, there is a conflict. The conflict is not due to the bondage, at least
not necessarily due to the bondage. It is because the two are pulling in two
directions.</p>
<p>Supposing the two bulls, somehow, accept the fact that they are in bondage and
behave amicably. When then the white bull pulls towards the stream, the black
one keeps him company with equanimity, though he is not in need of a drink. And
when the black bull is grazing, the white bull follows him along with
equanimity, though he is not inclined to eat.</p>
<p>Similarly, in this case too, the conflict is resolved by accepting the pair-wise
combination as a conjoined pair. That is how the Buddha solved this problem. But
still the point of this simile might not be clear enough.</p>
<p>So let us come back to the two links, birth and decay-and-death, which we so
often dragged in for purposes of clarification. So long as one does not accept
the fact that these two links, birth and decay-and-death, are a conjoined pair,
one would see between them a conflict. Why? Because one grasps birth as one end,
and tries to remove the other end, which one does not like, namely
decay-and-death. One is trying to separate birth from decay-and-death. But this
happens to be a conjoined pair. “Conditioned by birth, monks, is
decay-and-death.” This is the word of the Buddha. Birth and decay-and-death are
related to each other.</p>
<p>The word <em>jarā</em>, or decay, on analysis would make this clear. Usually by <em>jarā</em>
we mean old age. The word has connotations of senility and decrepitude, but the
word implies both growth and decay, as it sets in from the moment of one’s birth
itself. Only, there is a possible distinction according to the standpoint taken.
This question of a standpoint or a point of view is very important at this
juncture. This is something one should assimilate with a meditative attention.
Let us bring up a simile to make this clear.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, there could be a person who makes his living by selling the
leaves of a particular kind of tree. Suppose another man sells the flowers of
the same tree, to make his living. And yet another sells the fruits, while a
fourth sells the timber. If we line them up and put to them the question,
pointing to that tree: ‘Is this tree mature enough?’, we might sometimes get
different answers. Why? Each would voice his own commercial point of view
regarding the degree of maturity of the tree. For instance, one who sells
flowers would say that the tree is too old, if the flowering stage of the tree
is past.</p>
<p>Similarly, the concept of decay or old age can change according to the
standpoint taken up. From beginning to end, it is a process of decay. But we
create an artificial boundary between youth and old age. This again shows that
the two are a pair mutually conjoined. Generally, the worldlings are engaged in
an attempt to separate the two in this conjoined pair. Before the Buddha came
into the scene, all religious teachers were trying to hold on to birth, while
rejecting decay-and-death. But it was a vain struggle. It is like the attempt of
the miserly millionaire Kosiya to eat rice-cakes alone, to cite another
simile.</p>
<p>According to that instructive story, the millionaire Kosiya, an extreme miser,
once developed a strong desire to eat rice-cakes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn144-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn144">24</a></sup> As he did not wish to
share them with anyone else, he climbed up to the topmost storey of his mansion
with his wife and got her to cook rice-cakes for him.</p>
<p>To teach him a lesson, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, who excelled in psychic
powers, went through the air and appeared at the window as if he is on his alms
round. Kosiya, wishing to dismiss this intruder with a tiny rice-cake, asked
his wife to put a little bit of cake dough into the pan. She did so, but it
became a big rice-cake through the venerable <em>thera’s</em> psychic power. Further
attempts to make tinier rice-cakes ended up in producing ever bigger and bigger
ones. In the end, Kosiya thought of dismissing the monk with just one cake,
but to his utter dismay, all the cakes got joined to each other to form a string
of cakes. The couple then started pulling this string of cakes in either
direction with all their might, to separate just one from it. But without
success. At last they decided to let go and give up, and offered the entire
string of cakes to the venerable <em>Thera.</em></p>
<p>The Buddha’s solution to the above problem is a similar let go-ism and giving
up. It is a case of giving up all assets, <em>sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga</em>. You cannot
separate these links from one another. Birth and decay-and-death are
intertwined. This is a conjoined pair. So the solution here, is to let go. All
those problems are due to taking up a standpoint. Therefore the kind of view
sanctioned in this case, is one that leads to detachment and dispassion, one
that goes against the tendency to grasp and hold on. It is by grasping and
holding on that one comes into conflict with Māra.</p>
<p>Now going by the story of the millionaire Kosiya, one might think that the
Buddha was defeated by Māra. But the truth of the matter is that it is Māra
who suffered defeat by this sort of giving up. It is a very subtle point.</p>
<p>Māra’s forte lies in seizing and grabbing. He is always out to challenge.
Sometimes he takes delight in hiding himself to take one by surprise, to drive
terror and cause horripilation. So when Māra comes round to grab, if we can
find some means of foiling his attempt, or make it impossible for him to grab,
then Māra will have to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the Buddha’s solution to this question. There are in the
world various means of preventing others from grabbing something we possess. We
can either hide our property in an inaccessible place, or adopt security
measures, or else we can come to terms and sign a treaty with the enemy. But all
these measures can sometimes fail. However, there is one unfailing method, which
in principle is bound to succeed. A method that prevents all possibilities of
grabbing. And that is – letting go, giving up.</p>
<p>When one lets go, there is nothing to grab. In a tug-of-war, when someone is
pulling at one end with all his might, if the other suddenly lets go of its
hold, one can well imagine the extent of the former’s discomfiture, let alone
victory. It was such a discomfiture that fell to Māra’s lot, when the Buddha
applied this extraordinary solution. All this goes to show the importance of
such terms as <em>nissaya</em> and <em>idappaccayatā</em> in understanding this Dhamma.</p>
<p>We have already taken up the word <em>nissaya</em> for comment. Another aspect of its
significance is revealed by the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>. Some parts of this sutta,
though well known, are wonderfully deep. There is a certain thematic paragraph,
which occurs at the end of each subsection in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>. For
instance, in the section on the contemplation relating to body,
<em>kāyānupasssanā</em>, we find the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti ajjhattaṁ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati, bahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī
viharati, ajjhattabahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati; samudayadhammānupassī
vā kāyasmiṁ viharati, vayadhammānupassī vā kāyasmiṁ viharati,
samudayavayadhammānupassī vā kāyasmiṁ viharati; ’atthi kāyo’ti vā pan’assa
sati paccupaṭṭhitā hoti, yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya; anissito ca
viharati, na ca kiñci loke upādiyati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn145-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn145">25</a></sup></p>
<p>In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he
abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating
the body as a body internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating
the arising nature in the body, or he abides contemplating the dissolving
nature in the body, or he abides contemplating the arising and dissolving
nature in the body. Or else the mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is
established in him only to the extent necessary for just knowledge and further
mindfulness. And he abides independent and does not cling to anything in the
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar paragraph occurs throughout the sutta under all the four
contemplations, body, feeling, mind and mind objects. As a matter of fact, it is
this paragraph that is called <em>satipaṭṭhāna bhāvanā</em>, or meditation on the
foundation of mindfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn146-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn146">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The preamble to this paragraph introduces the foundation itself, or the setting
up of mindfulness as such. The above paragraph, on the other hand, deals with
what pertains to insight. It is the field of insight proper. If we examine this
paragraph, here too we will find a set of conjoined or twin terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he
abides contemplating the body externally,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he abides contemplating the body both internally and externally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He abides contemplating the arising nature in the body, or he abides
contemplating the dissolving nature in the body,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he abides contemplating both the arising and dissolving nature in the body.</p>
<p>Or else the mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in him only to
the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that for the meditator even the idea ‘there is a body’, that
remembrance, is there just for the purpose of further development of knowledge
and mindfulness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he abides independent and does not cling to anything in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here too, the word used is <em>anissita</em>, independent, or not leaning towards
anything. He does not cling to anything in the world. The word <em>nissaya</em> says
something more than grasping. It means ‘leaning on’ or ‘associating’.</p>
<p>This particular thematic paragraph in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> is of paramount
importance for insight meditation. Here, too, there is the mention of internal,
<em>ajjhatta</em>, and external, <em>bahiddhā</em>.</p>
<p>When one directs one’s attention to one’s own body and another’s body
separately, one might sometimes take these two concepts, internal and external,
too seriously with a dogmatic attitude. One might think that there is actually
something that could be called one’s own or another’s. But then the mode of
attention next mentioned unifies the two, as internal-external,
<em>ajjhattabahiddhā</em>, and presents them like the conjoined pair of bulls. And what
does it signify? These two are not to be viewed as two extremes, they are
related to each other.</p>
<p>Now let us go a little deeper into this interrelation. The farthest limit of the
internal is the nearest limit of the external. The farthest limit of the
external is the nearest limit of the internal. More strictly rendered,
<em>ajjhatta</em> means inward and <em>bahiddhā</em> means outward. So here we have the
duality of an inside and an outside.</p>
<p>One might think that the word <em>ajjhattika</em> refers to whatever is organic.
Nowadays many people take in artificial parts into their bodies. But once
acquired, they too become internal. That is why, in this context <em>ajjhattika</em>
has a deeper significance than its usual rendering as ‘one’s own’.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, the farthest limit of the <em>ajjhatta</em> remains the nearest
limit of the <em>bahiddhā</em>. Whatever portion one demarcates as one’s own, just
adjoining it and at its very gate is <em>bahiddhā</em>. And from the point of view of
<em>bahiddhā</em>, its farthest limit and at its periphery is <em>ajjhatta</em>. This is a
conjoined pair. These two are interrelated. So the implication is that these two
are not opposed to each other. That is why, by attending to them both together,
as <em>ajjhattabahiddhā</em>, that dogmatic involvement with a view is abandoned. Here
we have an element of reconciliation, which prevents adherence to a view. This
is what fosters the attitude of <em>anissita</em>, unattached.</p>
<p>So the two, <em>ajjhatta</em> and <em>bahiddhā</em>, are neighbours. Inside and outside as
concepts are neighbours to each other. It is the same as in the case of arising
and ceasing, mentioned above. This fact has already been revealed to some extent
by the <em>Kaccāyanagottasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Now if we go for an illustration, we have the word <em>udaya</em> at hand in
<em>samudaya</em>. Quite often this word is contrasted with <em>atthagama</em>, going down, in
the expression <em>udayatthagaminī paññā</em>, the wisdom that sees the rise and fall.
We can regard these two as words borrowed from everyday life. <em>Udaya</em> means
sunrise, and <em>atthagama</em> is sunset. If we take this itself as an illustration,
the farthest limit of the forenoon is the nearest limit of the afternoon. The
farthest limit of the afternoon is the nearest limit of the forenoon. And here
again we see a case of neighbourhood.</p>
<p>When one understands the neighbourly nature of the terms <em>udaya</em> and
<em>atthagama</em>, or <em>samudaya</em> and <em>vaya</em>, and regards them as interrelated by the
principle of <em>idappaccayatā</em>, one penetrates them both by that mode of
contemplating the rise and fall of the body together, <em>samudayavayadhammānupassī
vā kāyasmiṁ viharati</em>, and develops a penetrative insight.</p>
<p>What comes next in the <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> passage, is the outcome or net result of
that insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in him only to the
extent necessary for pure knowledge and further mindfulness,</p>
<p><em>’atthi kāyo’ti vā pan’assa sati pacupaṭṭhitā hoti, yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya
paṭissatimattāya</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that moment one does not take even the concept of body seriously. Even the
mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in that meditator only for the
sake of, <em>yavadeva</em>, clarity of knowledge and accomplishment of mindfulness. The
last sentence brings out the net result of that way of developing insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He abides independent and does not cling to anything in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only in the section on the contemplation of the body, but also in the
sections on feelings, mind, and mind objects in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, we find
this mode of insight development. None of the objects, taken up for the
foundation of mindfulness, is to be grasped tenaciously. Only their rise and
fall is discerned. So it seems that, what is found in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>,
is a group of concepts. These concepts serve only as a scaffolding for the
systematic development of mindfulness and knowledge. The Buddha often compared
his Dhamma to a raft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nittharaṇatthāya no gahaṇatthāya</em></p>
<p>for crossing over and not for holding on to.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn147-1"><a href="sermon-04.html#fn-fn147">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, what we have here are so many scaffoldings for the up-building of
mindfulness and knowledge.</p>
<p>Probably due to the lack of understanding of this deep philosophy enshrined in
the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, many sects of Buddhism took up these concepts in a
spirit of dogmatic adherence. That dogmatic attitude of clinging on is like the
attempt to cling on to the scaffoldings and to live on in them. So with
reference to the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> also, we can understand the importance of
the term <em>nissaya</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our last sermon, we discussed, to some extent, a special mode
of attention, regarding the four objects of contemplation in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> – body, feelings, mind, and mind-objects.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn149-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn149">2</a></sup> That
discussion might have revealed a certain middle path indicated by the Buddha.</p>
<p>We drew attention to a thematic paragraph, occurring throughout the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, which outlines a method of using objects and concepts for
<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation without dogmatic involvement. This leads the meditator
to a particular kind of attitude, summed up by the concluding phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He abides independent and does not cling to anything in the world,</p>
<p><em>anissito ca viharati, na ca kiñci loke upādiyati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn150-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn150">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of clarification, we brought in the simile of a scaffolding for a
building, that here the concepts only serve as a scaffolding for building up
mindfulness and knowledge.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn151-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn151">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Talking about the scaffolding, we are reminded of two different attitudes,
namely, the attitude of leaning on to and dwelling in the scaffolding itself,
and the enlightened attitude of merely utilizing it for the purpose of erecting
a building.</p>
<p>For further explanation of this technique, we may take up the two terms
<em>parāmasana</em> and <em>sammasana</em>. It might be better to distinguish the meanings of
these two terms also with the help of a simile. As for a simile, let us take up
the razor, which is such a useful requisite in our meditative life. There is a
certain special way in sharpening a razor. With the idea of sharpening the
razor, if one grabs it tightly and rubs it on the sharpening stone, it will only
become blunt. <em>Parāmasana</em>, grasping, grabbing, is something like that.</p>
<p>What then is the alternative? A more refined and softer approach is required as
meant by the term <em>sammasana</em>. There is a proper mode of doing it. One has to
hold the razor in a relaxed way, as if one is going to throw it away. One holds
it lightly, ready to let go of it at any time. But, of course, with mindfulness.
The wrist, also, is not rigid, but relaxed. Hand is supple at the joints and
easy to swing. Then with that readiness, one sharpens the razor, sliding it
smoothly on the stone. First: up, up, up, then: down, down, down, and then: up
down, up down, up down. The third combined movement ensures that those parts of
the blade still untouched by the stone will also get duly sharpened.</p>
<p>It is in the same manner that the razor of insight wisdom has to be whetted on
the sharpening stone of the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>. Inward, inward, inward –
outward, outward, outward – inward outward, inward outward. Or else: arising,
arising, arising – ceasing, ceasing, ceasing – arising ceasing, arising ceasing.</p>
<p>This is an illustration for the method of reflection, or <em>sammasana</em>, introduced
by the Buddha in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>. Words and concepts have to be made use
of, for attaining Nibbāna. But here the aim is only the up-building of
mindfulness and knowledge. Once their purpose is served, they can be dismantled
without being a bother to the mind. This is the significance of the concluding
phrase “He abides independent and does not cling to anything in the world”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn152-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn152">5</a></sup></p>
<p>There is another sutta in which the Buddha has touched upon this same point in
particular. It is the <em>Samudayasutta</em> in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasaṁyutta</em> of the
<em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. In that sutta, the Buddha has proclaimed the arising and
the going down of the four foundations of mindfulness. He begins by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I shall teach you the arising and the going down of the four
foundations of mindfulness.</p>
<p><em>Catunnaṁ, bhikkhave, satipaṭṭhānānaṁ samudayañca atthagamañca
desessāmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn153-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn153">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ko ca, bhikkhave, kāyassa samudayo? Āhārasamudayā kāyassa samudayo,
āhāranirodhā kāyassa atthagamo</em>.</p>
<p>What, monks, is the arising of the body? With the arising of nutriment is the
arising of the body and with the cessation of the nutriment is the going down
of the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Phassasamudayā vedanānaṁ samudayo, phassanirodhā vedanānaṁ atthagamo</em>.</p>
<p>With the arising of contact is the arising of feeling, and with the cessation
of contact is the going down of feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāmarūpasamudayā cittassa samudayo, nāmarūpanirodhā cittassa atthagamo</em>.</p>
<p>With the arising of name-and-form is the arising of the mind, and with the
cessation of name-and-form is the going down of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Manasikārasamudayā dhammānaṁ samudayo, manasikāranirodhā dhammānaṁ
atthagamo</em>.</p>
<p>With the arising of attention is the arising of mind-objects, and with the
ceasing of attention is the going down of mind-objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, too, is an important discourse, well worth remembering, because here the
Buddha is dealing with the arising and cessation, or arising and going down, of
the four objects used for establishing mindfulness.</p>
<p>As we know, the concept of nutriment in this Dhamma is much broader than the
worldly concept of food. It does not imply merely the ordinary food, for which
the term used is <em>kabaliṅkārāhāra</em>, or material food. Taken in a deeper sense,
it includes the other three kinds of nutriment as well, namely <em>phassa</em>, or
contact, <em>manosañcetanā</em>, or volition, and <em>viññāṇa</em>, or consciousness. These
four together account for the concept of body as such. Therefore, due to these
four there comes to be a body, and with their cessation the body ends. So also
in the case of feeling. We all know that the arising of feeling is due to
contact.</p>
<p>The reference to name-and-form in this context might not be clear enough at
once, due to various definitions of name-and-form, or <em>nāma-rūpa</em>. Here, the
reason for the arising of the mind is said to be name-and-form. Mind is said to
arise because of name-and-form, and it is supposed to go down with the cessation
of name-and-form.</p>
<p>The fact that the mind-objects arise due to attention is noteworthy. All the
mind-objects mentioned in the fourth section of contemplation arise when there
is attention. And they go down when attention is not there. In other words,
attending makes objects out of them. This way, we are reminded that, apart from
making use of these words and concepts for the purpose of attaining Nibbāna,
there is nothing worth holding on to or clinging to dogmatically. So if a
meditator works with this aim in mind, he will be assured of a state of mind
that is independent and clinging-free, <em>anissita</em>, <em>anupādāna</em>.</p>
<p>One marvellous quality of the Buddha’s teaching emerges from this discussion. A
mind-object is something that the mind hangs on to as the connotations of the
word <em>ārammaṇa</em> (cp. <em>ālambhana</em>) suggest. But because of the mode of insight
wisdom outlined here, because of the middle path approach, even the tendency to
‘hang-on’ is finally done away with and the object is penetrated through.
Despite the above connotations of ‘hanging on’ (<em>ārammaṇa</em>), the object is
transcended. Transcendence in its highest sense is not a case of surpassing, as
is ordinarily understood. Instead of leaving behind, it penetrates through. Here
then, we have a transcendence that is in itself a penetration.</p>
<p>So the terms <em>anissita</em> and <em>anupādāna</em> seem to have a significance of their
own. More of it comes to light in quite a number of other suttas. Particularly
in the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> we come across the
following two verses, which throw more light on these two terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anissito na calati,</em> <br />
<em>nissito ca upādiyaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁsāraṁ nātivattati.</em></p>
<p><em>Etam ādīnavaṁ ñatvā,</em> <br />
<em>nissayesu mahabbhayaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anissito anupādāno,</em> <br />
<em>sato bhikkhu paribbaje</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn154-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn154">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The unattached one wavers not, <br />
But the one attached, clinging on, <br />
Does not get beyond <em>saṁsāra</em>, <br />
Which is an alternation between a this-ness and an otherwise-ness.</p>
<p>Knowing this peril, <br />
The great danger, in attachments or supports <br />
Let the monk fare along mindfully, <br />
Resting on nothing, clinging to nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caught up in the dichotomy of <em>saṁsāric</em> existence, which alternates between
this-ness and otherwise-ness, one is unable to transcend it, so long as there is
attachment and clinging. <em>Nissayas</em> are the supports that encourage clinging in
the form of dogmatic adherence to views. Seeing the peril and the danger in
them, a mindful monk has no recourse to them. This gives one an idea of the
attitude of an <em>arahant</em>. His mind is free from enslavement to the conjoined
pairs of relative concepts.</p>
<p>This fact is borne out by certain Canonical statements, which at first sight
might appear as riddles. The two last sections of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, the
<em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> and the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> in particular, contain verses which are
extremely deep. In the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em>, one often comes across apparently
contradictory pairs of terms, side by side. About the <em>arahant</em> it is said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he neither grasps nor gives up,</p>
<p><em>nādeti na nirassati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn155-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn155">8</a></sup></p>
<p>There is nothing taken up or rejected by him,</p>
<p><em>attaṁ nirattaṁ na hi tassa atthi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn156-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn156">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, the word <em>attaṁ</em> in this context is derived from <em>ādātta</em> (<em>ā</em> +
<em>dā</em>), by syncopation. It should not be mistaken as a reference to <em>attā</em>, or
soul. Similarly, <em>niratta</em> is from <em>as</em>, to throw, <em>nirasta</em>, conveying the idea
of giving up or putting down.</p>
<p>There is nothing taken up or given up by the <em>arahant</em>. Other such references to
the <em>arahant’s</em> attitude are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na rāgarāgī na virāgaratto</em>,</p>
<p>He is neither attached to attachment, nor attached to detachment.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn157-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn157">10</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Na hi so rajjati no virajjati</em>,</p>
<p>He is neither attached nor detached.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn158-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn158">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in order to explain why such references are used that we took all this
trouble to discuss at length the significance of such terms as
<em>nissaya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn159-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn159">12</a></sup> Probably due to a lack of understanding in this respect, the
deeper meanings of such suttas have got obscured. Not only that, even textual
corruption through distorted variant readings has set in, because they appeared
like riddles. However, the deeper sense of these suttas sometimes emerges from
certain strikingly strange statements like the following found in the
<em>Khajjanīyasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. The reference here is to the
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu neva ācināti na apacināti, apacinitvā ṭhito
neva pajahati na upādiyati, pajahitvā ṭhito neva viseneti na usseneti,
visenetvā ṭhito neva vidhūpeti na sandhūpeti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn160-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn160">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, such a monk is called one who neither amasses nor diminishes; already
diminished as he is, he neither gives up nor grasps; already given up as he
is, he neither disbands nor binds together; already disbanded as he is, he
neither exorcizes nor proficiates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even to one who does not understand the language, the above quotation would
sound enigmatic. Even the rendering of the terms used here is not an easy
matter, because of the nuances they seem to convey.</p>
<p>We could perhaps say that such a monk neither amasses or accumulates, nor
diminishes. Since he is already diminished, presumably as regards the five
aggregates, he neither abandons nor grasps anew. Since the giving up is
complete, he neither binds together or enlists (note the word <em>sena,</em> army), nor
disbands. Disbanding (if not ‘disarmament’), being complete, there is neither
exorcizing or smoking out, nor proficiating or inviting. The coupling of these
terms and their peculiar employment is suggestive of the <em>arahant’s</em> freedom
from the dichotomy.</p>
<p>In the <em>Brāhmaṇavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em> too, we come across a similar
enigmatic verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,</em> <br />
<em>pārāpāraṁ na vijjati,</em> <br />
<em>vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tam ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn161-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn161">14</a></sup></p>
<p>For whom there is neither a farther shore, <br />
Nor a hither shore, nor both, <br />
Who is undistressed and unfettered, <br />
Him I call a Brahmin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context the word <em>brāhmaṇa</em> refers to the <em>arahant</em>. Here too, it is
said that the <em>arahant</em> has neither a farther shore, nor a hither shore, nor
both. This might sometimes appear as a problem. Our usual concept of an
<em>arahant</em> is of one who has crossed over the ocean of <em>saṁsāra</em> and is standing
on the other shore. But here is something enigmatic.</p>
<p>We come across a similar sutta in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> also, namely its very
first, the <em>Uragasutta</em>. The extraordinary feature of this sutta is the
recurrence of the same refrain throughout its seventeen verses. The refrain is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṁ purāṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn162-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn162">15</a></sup></p>
<p>That monk forsakes the hither and the tither, <br />
Like a snake its slough that doth wither.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simile of the slough, or the worn-out skin of the snake, is highly
significant. To quote one instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo nājjhagamā bhavesu sāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vicinaṁ pupphamiva udumbaresu,</em> <br />
<em>so bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṁ purāṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn163-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn163">16</a></sup></p>
<p>That monk who sees no essence in existence, <br />
Like one seeking flowers in <em>Udumbara</em> trees, <br />
Will give up the hither as well as the thither, <br />
Like the snake its slough that doth wither.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> has abandoned his attachment to existence. As such, he is free
from the bondage of those conjoined terms in worldly usage. So the <em>arahant</em>
looks at the worldly usage in the same way as a snake would turn back and look
at the worn-out skin he has sloughed off. Sometimes we see a snake moving about
with a remnant of its slough hanging on. We might even think that the snake is
carrying its slough around. It is the same in the case of the <em>arahants</em>.</p>
<p>Now there is this term <em>sa-upādisesa Nibbāna dhātu</em>. Taking the term at its face
value, some might think that the clinging is not yet over for the <em>arahants</em> –
that there is still a little bit left.</p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em>, though he has attained release and realized Nibbāna, so long as
he is living in the world, has to relate to the external objects in the world
somehow through his five senses, making use of them. Seeing it, some might
conclude that it is because of some residual clinging. But we have to understand
this in the light of the simile of the worn-out skin. In the case of the
<em>arahant</em>, too, the sloughed off skin is still hanging on.</p>
<p>As a sidelight we may cite a remark of Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iminā pūtikāyena aṭṭiyāmi harāyāmi jigucchāmi,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn164-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn164">17</a></sup></p>
<p>I am harassed and repelled by this body, I am ashamed of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because the body is for him something already abandoned. All this goes
to show that the <em>arahant</em> has an unattached, unclinging attitude.</p>
<p>Linguistic usage, which is a special feature of existence, is enlivened by the
cravings, conceits, and views with which it is grasped. Worldlings thrive on it,
whereas the <em>arahants</em> are free from it. This is the upshot of the above
discussion on the terms <em>anusaya</em> and <em>nissaya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn165-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn165">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet another important term that should receive attention in any discussion on
Nibbāna is <em>āsava</em>. This is because the <em>arahant</em> is often called a
<em>khīṇāsava</em>, one whose <em>āsavas</em> are extinct.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn166-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn166">19</a></sup> <em>Āsavakkhayo</em>, extinction
of <em>āsavas</em>, is an epithet of Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn167-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn167">20</a></sup> So the distinct feature of an
<em>arahant</em> is his extinction of <em>āsavas</em>.</p>
<p>Now, what does <em>āsava</em> mean? In ordinary life, this word is used to denote
fermentation or liquor that has got fermented for a long time.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn168-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn168">21</a></sup> If there
is even a dreg of ferment in a vessel, it is enough to cause fermentation for
any suitable raw material put into it. So also are the <em>āsavas</em>. They are like
the residual dregs of the ebullient mass of defilements in beings, which have
undergone fermentation for a long, long time in <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>Very often, <em>āsavas</em> are said to be of three kinds, as <em>kāmāsavā, bhavāsavā</em>,
and <em>avijjāsavā</em>. The term <em>āsava</em> in this context is usually rendered as
‘influxes’. We may understand them as certain intoxicating influences, which
create a world of sense-desires, a stupor that gives a notion of existence and
leads to ignorance. These influxes are often said to have the nature of
infiltrating into the mind. Sometimes a fourth type of influxes, <em>diṭṭhāsavā</em>,
is also mentioned. But this can conveniently be subsumed under <em>avijjāsavā</em>.</p>
<p>The extinction of influxes becomes a distinctive characteristic of an <em>arahant</em>,
as it ensures complete freedom. One could be said to have attained complete
freedom only if one’s mind is free from these influxes. It is because these
influxes are capable of creating intoxication again and again.</p>
<p>The immense importance of the extinction of influxes, and how it accounts for
the worthiness of an <em>arahant</em>, is sometimes clearly brought out. The ultimate
aim of the Buddha’s teaching is one that in other systems of thought is
generally regarded as attainable only after death. The Buddha, on the other
hand, showed a way to its realization here and now.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, even brahmins like Pokkharasāti went about saying that it
is impossible for a human being to attain something supramundane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katham’hi nāma manussabhūto uttarimanussadhammā alamariyañāṇadassanavisesaṁ
ñassati vā dakkhati vā sacchi vā karissati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn169-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn169">22</a></sup></p>
<p>How can one as a human being know or see or realize a supramundane state, an
extraordinary knowledge and vision befitting the noble ones?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They thought that such a realization is possible only after death. Immortality,
in other systems of thought, is always an after death experience.</p>
<p>Now the realization of the extinction of influxes, on the other hand, gives a
certain assurance about the future. It is by this extinction of influxes that
one wins to the certitude that there is no more birth after this. <em>Khīṇā
jāti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn170-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn170">23</a></sup> extinct is birth! Certitude about something comes only with
realization. In fact, the term <em>sacchikiriya</em> implies a seeing with one’s own
eyes, as the word for eye, <em>akśi</em>, is implicit in it.</p>
<p>However, everything cannot be verified by seeing with one’s own eyes. The Buddha
has pointed out that there are four ways of realization or verification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cattāro me, bhikkhave, sacchikaraṇīyā dhammā. Katame cattaro?Atthi,
bhikkhave, dhammā kāyena sacchikaraṇīyā; atthi, bhikkhave, dhammā satiyā
sacchikaraṇīyā; atthi, bhikkhave, dhammā cakkhunā sacchikaraṇīyā; atthi,
bhikkhave, dhammā paññāya sacchikaraṇīyā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn171-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn171">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these four realizable things. What four? There are things,
monks, that are realizable through the body; there are things, monks, that are
realizable through memory; there are things, monks, that are realizable
through the eye; there are things, monks, that are realizable through wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of explanation, the Buddha says that the things realizable through the
body are the eight deliverances, the things realizable through memory are one’s
former habitations, the things realizable through the eye are the death and
rebirth of beings, and what is realizable through wisdom, is the extinction of
influxes.</p>
<p>One’s former lives cannot be seen with one’s own eyes by running into the past.
It is possible only by purifying one’s memory and directing it backwards.
Similarly, the death and rebirth of beings can be seen, as if with one’s fleshly
eye, by the divine eye, by those who have developed it. So also the fact of
extirpating all influxes is to be realized by wisdom, and not by any other
means. The fact that the influxes of sensuality, existence, ignorance, and
views, will not flow in again, can be verified only by wisdom. That is why
special mention is made of Nibbāna as something realizable.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn172-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn172">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Because Nibbāna is said to be something realizable, some are of the opinion
that nothing should be predicated about it. What is the reason for this special
emphasis on its realizability? It is to bring into sharp relief the point of
divergence, since the Buddha taught a way of realizing here and now something
that in other religions was considered impossible.</p>
<p>What was it that they regarded impossible to be realized? The cessation of
existence, or <em>bhavanirodha</em>. How can one be certain here and now that this
existence has ceased? This might sometimes appear as a big puzzle. But all the
same, the <em>arahant</em> experiences the cessation of existence as a realization.
That is why he even gives expression to it as: <em>Bhavanirodho Nibbānaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn173-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn173">26</a></sup>
“cessation of existence is Nibbāna”.</p>
<p>It comes about by this extinction of influxes. The very existence of ‘existence’
is especially due to the flowing in of influxes of existence. What is called
‘existence’ is not the apparent process of existing visible to others. It is
something that pertains to one’s own mental continuum.</p>
<p>For instance, when it is said that some person is in the world of sense desires,
one might sometimes imagine it as living surrounded by objects of sense
pleasure. But that is not always the case. It is the existence in a world of
sense desires, built up by sensuous thoughts. It is the same with the realms of
form and formless realms. Even those realms can be experienced and attained
while living in this world itself.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is possible for one to realize the complete cessation of this
existence while living in this very world. It is accomplished by winning to the
realization that the influxes of sense desires, existence, and ignorance, no
longer influence one’s mind.</p>
<p>So all this goes to show the high degree of importance attached to the word
<em>āsava</em>. The <em>Sammādiṭṭhisutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> seems to pose a problem
regarding the significance of this term. At one place in the sutta it is said
that the arising of ignorance is due to the arising of influxes and that the
cessation of ignorance is due to the cessation of influxes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Āsavasamudayā avijjāsamudayo, āsavanirodhā avijjānirodho</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn174-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn174">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the sutta says only this much, it will not be such a problem, because it
appears as a puzzle to many nowadays, why ignorance is placed first. Various
reasons are adduced and arguments put forward as to why it is stated first out
of the twelve factors. The fact that there is still something to precede it
could therefore be some consolation.</p>
<p>But then, a little way off, in the selfsame sutta, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Avijjāsamudayā āsavasamudayo, avijjanirodhā āsavanirodho,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn175-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn175">28</a></sup></p>
<p>with the arising of ignorance is the arising of influxes, with the cessation
of ignorance is the cessation of influxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently this contradicts the previous statement. The preacher of this
discourse, Venerable Sāriputta, is not one who contradicts himself. So most
probably there is some deep reason behind this.</p>
<p>Another problem crops up, since ignorance is also counted among the different
kinds of influxes. This makes our puzzle all the more deep. But this state of
affairs could best be understood with the help of an illustration. It is in
order to explain a certain fascinating behaviour of the mind that even
<em>arahants</em> of great wisdom had to make seemingly contradictory statements.</p>
<p>We have to draw in at this juncture a very important discourse in the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>, which is a marvel in itself. It comes in the section on the aggregates,
<em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>, as the second <em>Gaddulasutta</em>. Here the Buddha makes the
following impressive declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘<em>Diṭṭhaṁ vo, bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittan’ti?’ ‘Evaṁ, bhante.’ ’Tampi kho,
bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittaṁ citteneva cintitaṁ. Tenapi kho, bhikkhave,
caraṇena cittena cittaññeva cittataraṁ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, abhikkhaṇaṁ
sakaṁ cittaṁ paccavekkhitabbaṁ: Dīgharattam idaṁ cittaṁ saṁkiliṭṭhaṁ rāgena
dosena mohenā’ti. Cittasaṁkilesā, bhikkhave, sattā saṁkilissanti, cittavodānā
sattā visujjhanti</em>.</p>
<p><em>Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, aññaṁ ekanikāyampi samanupassāmi evaṁ cittaṁ, yathayidaṁ,
bhikkhave, tiracchānagatā pāṇā. Tepi kho, bhikkhave, tiracchānagatā pāṇā
citteneva cintitā. Tehipi kho, bhikkhave, tiracchānagatehi pāṇehi cittaññeva
cittataraṁ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā abhikkhaṇaṁ sakaṁ cittaṁ
paccavekkhitabbaṁ: Dīgharattam idaṁ cittaṁ saṁkiliṭṭhaṁ rāgena dosena
mohenā’ti. Cittasaṁkilesā, bhikkhave, sattā saṁkilissanti, cittavodānā sattā
visujjhanti</em>.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn176-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn176">29</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Monks, have you seen a picture called a movie (<em>caraṇa</em>)?’ ‘Yes, Lord.’
’Monks, even that picture called a movie is something thought out by the mind.
But this mind, monks, is more picturesque than that picture called a movie.
Therefore, monks, you should reflect moment to moment on your own mind with
the thought: For a long time has this mind been defiled by lust, hate, and
delusion. By the defilement of the mind, monks, are beings defiled. By the
purification of the mind, are beings purified.</p>
<p>Monks, I do not see any other class of beings as picturesque as beings in the
animal realm. But those beings in the animal realm, monks, are also thought
out by the mind. And the mind, monks, is far more picturesque than those
beings in the animal realm. Therefore, monks, should a monk reflect moment to
moment on one’s own mind with the thought: For a long time has this mind been
defiled by lust, hate, and delusion. By the defilement of the mind, monks, are
beings defiled. By the purification of the mind, are beings purified.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha gives two illustrations to show how marvellous this mind is.
First he asks the monks whether they have seen a picture called <em>caraṇa</em>. Though
the word may be rendered by movie, it is not a motion picture of the sort we
have today. According to the commentary, it is some kind of variegated painting
done on a mobile canvas-chamber, illustrative of the results of good and evil
karma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn177-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn177">30</a></sup> Whatever it may be, it seems to have been something marvellous.
But far more marvellous, according to the Buddha, is this mind. The reason given
is that even such a picture is something thought out by the mind.</p>
<p>Then, by way of an advice to the monks, says the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, monks, you should reflect on your mind moment to moment with the
thought: For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust, hate, and
delusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moral drawn is that beings are defiled by the defilement of their minds and
that they are purified by the purification of their minds. This is the
illustration by the simile of the picture.</p>
<p>And then the Buddha goes on to make another significant declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I do not see any other class of beings as picturesque as beings in the
animal realm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But since those beings also are thought out by the mind, he declares that the
mind is far more picturesque than them. Based on this conclusion, he repeats the
same advice as before.</p>
<p>At first sight the sutta, when it refers to a picture, seems to be speaking
about the man who drew it. But there is something deeper than that. When the
Buddha says that the picture called <em>caraṇa</em> is also something thought out by
the mind, he is not simply stating the fact that the artist drew it after
thinking it out with his mind. The reference is rather to the mind of the one
who sees it. He, who sees it, regards it as something marvellous. He creates a
picture out of it. He imagines something picturesque in it.</p>
<p>In fact, the allusion is not to the artist’s mind, but to the spectator’s mind.
It is on account of the three defilements lust, hate, and delusion, nurtured in
his mind for a long time, that he is able to appreciate and enjoy that picture.
Such is the nature of those influxes.</p>
<p>That is why the Buddha declared that this mind is far more picturesque than the
picture in question. So if one turns back to look at one’s own mind, in
accordance with the Buddha’s advice, it will be a wonderful experience, like
watching a movie. Why? Because reflection reveals the most marvellous sight in
the world.</p>
<p>But usually one does not like to reflect, because one has to turn back to do so.
One is generally inclined to look at the thing in front. However, the Buddha
advises us to turn back and look at one’s own mind every moment. Why? Because
the mind is more marvellous than that picture called <em>caraṇa</em>, or movie.</p>
<p>It is the same declaration that he makes with reference to the beings in the
animal realm. When one comes to think about it, there is even less room for
doubt here, than in the case of the picture. First of all, the Buddha declares
that there is no class of beings more picturesque than those in the animal
realm. But he follows it up with the statement that even those beings are
thought out by the mind, to draw the conclusion that as such the mind is more
picturesque than those beings of the animal realm.</p>
<p>Let us try to sort out the point of this declaration. Generally, we may agree
that beings in the animal realm are the most picturesque. We sometimes say that
the butterfly is beautiful. But we might hesitate to call a blue fly beautiful.
The tiger is fierce, but the cat is not. Here one’s personal attitude accounts
much for the concepts of beauty, ugliness, fierceness, and innocence of animals.
It is because of the defiling influence of influxes, such as ignorance, that the
world around us appears so picturesque.</p>
<p>Based on this particular sutta, with its reference to the <em>caraṇa</em> picture as
a prototype, we may take a peep at the modern day’s movie film, by way of an
analogy. It might facilitate the understanding of the teachings on <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em> and Nibbāna in a way that is closer to our everyday life. The
principles governing the film and the drama are part and parcel of the life
outside cinema and the theatre. But since it is generally difficult to grasp
them in the context of the life outside, we shall now try to elucidate them with
reference to the cinema and the theatre.</p>
<p>Usually a film or a drama is shown at night. The reason for it is the presence
of darkness. This darkness helps to bring out the darkness of ignorance that
dwells in the minds of beings. So the film as well as the drama is presented to
the public within a framework of darkness. If a film is shown at day time, as a
matinee show, it necessitates closed windows and dark curtains. In this way,
films and dramas are shown within a curtained enclosure.</p>
<p>There is another strange thing about these films and dramas. One goes to the
cinema or the theatre saying: “I am going to see a film show, I am going to see
a drama”. And one returns saying: “I have seen a film show, I have seen a
drama”. But while the film show or the drama is going on, one forgets that one
is seeing a show or a drama.</p>
<p>Such a strange spell of delusion takes over. This is due to the intoxicating
influence of influxes. If one wishes to enjoy a film show or a drama, one should
be prepared to get intoxicated by it. Otherwise it will cease to be a film show
or a drama for him.</p>
<p>What do the film producers and dramatists do? They prepare the background for
eliciting the influxes of ignorance, latent in the minds of the audience. That
is why such shows and performances are held at night, or else dark curtains are
employed. They have an intricate job to do. Within the framework of darkness,
they have to create a delusion in the minds of their audience, so as to enact
some story in a realistic manner.</p>
<p>To be successful, a film or a drama has to be given a touch of realism. Though
fictitious, it should be apparently real for the audience. There is an element
of deception involved, a hoodwink. For this touch of realism, quite a lot of
make-up on the part of actors and actresses is necessary. As a matter of fact,
in the ancient Indian society, one of the primary senses of the word <em>saṅkhāra</em>
was the make-up done by actors and actresses.</p>
<p>Now in the present context, <em>saṅkhāra</em> can include not only this make-up in
personal appearance, but also the acting itself, the delineation of character,
stage-craft etc.. In this way, the film producers and dramatists create a
suitable environment, making use of the darkness and the make-up contrivances.
These are the <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or the ‘preparations’.</p>
<p>However, to be more precise, it is the audience that make preparations, in the
last analysis. Here too, as before, we are compelled to make a statement that
might appear strange: So far not a single cinema has held a film show and not a
single theatre has staged a drama.</p>
<p>And yet, those who had gone to the cinema and the theatre had seen film shows
and dramas. Now, how can that be? Usually, we think that it is the film producer
who produced the film and that it is the dramatist who made the drama.</p>
<p>But if we are to understand the deeper implications of what the Buddha declared,
with reference to the picture <em>caraṇa</em>, a film show or drama is produced, in the
last analysis, by the spectator himself. When he goes to the cinema and the
theatre, he takes with him the spices needed to concoct a film or a drama, and
that is: the influxes, or <em>āsavas</em>. Whatever technical defects and shortcomings
there are in them, he makes good with his influxes.</p>
<p>As we know, in a drama there is a certain interval between two scenes. But the
average audience is able to appreciate even such a drama, because they are
influenced by the influxes of sense desire, existence, and ignorance.</p>
<p>With the progress in science and technology, scenes are made to fall on the
screen with extreme rapidity. All the same, the element of delusion is still
there. The purpose is to create the necessary environment for arousing delusion
in the minds of the audience. Whatever preparations others may make, if the
audience does not respond with their own preparations along the same lines, the
drama will not be a success. But in general, the worldlings have a tendency to
prepare and concoct, so they would make up for any short comings in the film or
the drama with their own preparations and enjoy them.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, let us think of an occasion when a film show is going on
within the framework of darkness. In the case of a matinee show, doors and
windows will have to be closed. Supposing the doors are suddenly flung open,
while a vivid technicolour scene is flashing on the screen, what happens then?
The spectators will find themselves suddenly thrown out of the cinema world they
had created for themselves. Why? Because the scene in technicolour has now lost
its colour. It has faded away. The result is dejection, disenchantment. The film
show loses its significance.</p>
<p>That film show owed its existence to the dark framework of ignorance and the
force of preparations. But now that the framework has broken down, such a vast
change has come over, resulting in a disenchantment. Now the word <em>rāga</em> has a
nuance suggestive of colour, so <em>virāga</em>, dispassion, can also literally mean a
fading away or a decolouration. Here we have a possible instance of <em>nibbidā
virāga</em>, disenchantment, dispassion, at least in a limited sense.</p>
<p>A door suddenly flung open can push aside the delusion, at least temporarily.
Let us consider the implications of this little event. The film show, in this
case, ceases to be a film show because of a flash of light coming from outside.
Now, what would have happened if this flash of light had come from within – from
within one’s mind? Then also something similar would have happened. If the light
of wisdom dawns on one’s mind while watching a film show or a drama, one would
even wonder whether it is actually a film or a drama, while others are enjoying
it.</p>
<p>Speaking about the film show, we mentioned above that the spectator has entered
into a world of his own creation. If we are to analyse this situation according
to the law of dependent origination, we may add that in fact he has a
consciousness and a name-and-form in line with the events of the story, based on
the preparations in the midst of the darkness of ignorance. With all his
experiences in seeing the film show, he is building up his five aggregates.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the light of wisdom comes and dispels the darkness of ignorance,
a similar event can occur. One will come out of that plane of existence. One
will step out of the world of sense desires, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Now, with regard to the <em>arahants</em>, too, the same trend of events holds good.
When their ignorance ceases, leaving no residue, <em>avijjāya tveva
asesavirāganirodhā</em>, exhausting the influxes as well, preparations also cease.
Why? Because the preparations owe their existence to ignorance. They have the
ability to prepare so long as there is ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em> generally means preparations. It is the make-up and the make-believe
which accounted for the delusion. The darkness of ignorance provided the setting
for it. If somehow or other, the light of wisdom enters the scene, those
preparations, <em>saṅkhāra</em>, became no-preparations, <em>visaṅkhāra</em>, and the
prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>, becomes a non-prepared, <em>asaṅkhata</em>.</p>
<p>So what was true with regard to the film show, is also true, in a deeper sense,
with regard to the events leading up to the attainment of <em>arahanthood</em>. With
the dawn of that light of wisdom, the preparations, or <em>saṅkhāra</em>, lose their
significance and become <em>visaṅkhāra</em>.</p>
<p>Though for the world outside they appear as preparations, for the <em>arahant</em> they
are not preparations, because they do not prepare a <em>bhava</em>, or existence, for
him. They are made ineffective. Similarly, the prepared or the made-up, when it
is understood as something prepared or made-up, becomes an un-prepared or an
un-made. There is a subtle principle of un-doing involved in this.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this might be regarded as a modernistic interpretation. But there is
Canonical evidence in support of such an interpretation. For instance, in the
<em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, we come across the following
verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nivutānaṁ tamo hoti,</em> <br />
<em>andhakāro apassataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>satañca vivaṭaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>āloko passatāmiva,</em> <br />
<em>santike na vijānanti,</em> <br />
<em>magā dhammassa akovidā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn178-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn178">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Murk it is to those enveloped, <br />
As darkness unto the undiscerning, <br />
But to the good wide ope’ it is, <br />
As light is unto those discerning, <br />
So near, and yet they know not, <br />
Fools, unskilled in the Norm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is all murky to those enveloped by the hindrance of ignorance, like the
darkness for those who are unable to see. But for the noble ones, it is visible
like an open space, even as the light to those with vision. Though it is near at
hand, fools, inexpert in the Dhamma, do not understand. This same impression
of the Buddha comes up again in the following verse in the <em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mohasambandhano loko,</em> <br />
<em>bhabbarūpo va dissati,</em> <br />
<em>upadhibandhano bālo,</em> <br />
<em>tamasā parivārito,</em> <br />
<em>sassatoriva khāyati,</em> <br />
<em>passato natthi kiñcanaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn179-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn179">32</a></sup></p>
<p>The world, enfettered to delusion, <br />
Feigns a promising mien, <br />
The fool, to his assets bound, <br />
Sees only darkness around, <br />
It looks as though it would last, <br />
But to him who sees there is naught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world appears as real to one who is fettered to delusion. He imagines it to
be reliable. And so the fool, relying on his assets, is encompassed by the
darkness. To him the world appears as eternal. But the one who has the right
vision, knows that in reality there is nothing.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that the life outside is not much different from what goes
on within the four walls of the cinema and the theatre. Just as, in the latter
case, an enjoyable story is created out of a multitude of scenes, relayed at
varying degrees of rapidity, backed by the delusive make-up of actors and
actresses, so that one may lose oneself in a world of fantasy, even so,
according to the point of view of Dhamma, the lifestyle outside is something
made up and concocted.</p>
<p>However, the darkness within is much thicker than the darkness outside. The
darkness outside may be dispelled even by a door flung open, as we saw above.
But not so easily the darkness within. That is why, in the psalms of the
Theras and Therīs, it is said that they split or burst asunder the mass of
delusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tamokhandhaṁ padāliya,</em> [and also as] <br />
<em>tamokhandhaṁ padālayiṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn180-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn180">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pitchy black darkness of ignorance in the world is one that is thick enough
to be split up and burst asunder. So it seems, the darkness within is almost
tangibly thick. But the first incision on this thick curtain of darkness is made
by the path knowledge of the Stream-winner.</p>
<p>As a side-light, we may cite an episode from the lives of the Venerables
Sāriputta and Mahā Moggallāna, the two chief disciples of the Buddha.
Formerly, as brahmin youths, they were known as Upatissa and Kolita. These
two young men once went to see a hill-top festival, called
<em>giraggasamajja</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn181-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn181">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Since by then, their discerning wisdom was already matured, they suddenly
developed a dejection about the entertainment going on. The hill-top festival,
as it were, lost its festivity for them. They understood the vanity of it and
could no longer enjoy it as before.</p>
<p>They may have already had a distant glimpse of the similarity between the two
levels of experience, mentioned above. But they on their own could not get at
the principles underlying the delusion involved.</p>
<p>Much later, as a wandering ascetic, when Upatissa met the Venerable Assaji
Thera on his alms-round, he begged the latter to preach the Dhamma to him.
Venerable Assaji said: “I know only a little”. Upatissa also assured him: “I
need only a little”. Venerable Assaji preached ‘a little’ and Upatissa, too,
heard ‘a little’, but since there was much in it, the latter attained the Fruit
of Stream-winning even on hearing the first two lines of the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā,</em> <br />
<em>tesam hetuṁ Tathāgato āha,</em> <br />
<em>tesañca yo nirodho,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ vādi mahāsamaṇo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn182-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn182">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Of things that proceed from a cause, <br />
Their cause the Tathāgata has told, <br />
And also their cessation, <br />
Thus teaches the great ascetic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse gives in a nutshell the law of dependent arising. From it, Upatissa
got the clue to his riddle of life.</p>
<p>Some interpret the word <em>hetu</em>, cause, in this verse, as <em>avijjā</em>, or ignorance,
the first link. But that is not the case. It refers to the basic principle known
as <em>idappaccayatā</em>, the relatedness of this to that.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn183-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn183">36</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Hetuppabhavā dhammā</em> is a reference to things dependently arisen. In point of
fact, it is said about a Stream-winner that he has seen well the cause as well
as the things arisen from a cause: <em>Hetu ca sudiṭṭho, hetusamuppanā ca
dhammā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn184-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn184">37</a></sup> That means that he has seen the law of dependent arising as
also the dependently arisen phenomena.</p>
<p>We have already discussed the significance of these two terms.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn185-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn185">38</a></sup> What is
called <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is the basic principle itself. It is said that the
wandering ascetic Upatissa was able to arouse the path of Stream-winning on
hearing just the first two lines,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn186-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn186">39</a></sup> and these state the basic principle as
such.</p>
<p>The word <em>tesaṁ</em>, plural, clearly implies that the reference is to all the
twelve factors, inclusive of ignorance. The cessation, also, is of those twelve,
as for instance it is said in the <em>Udāna</em>: <em>Khayaṁ paccayānaṁ avedi</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn187-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn187">40</a></sup>
“understood the cessation of conditions”, since all the twelve are conditions.</p>
<p>To sum up: Whatever phenomena that arise from a cause, their cause is
<em>idappaccayatā</em>, or the law of relatedness of this to that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This being, this exists, <br />
With the arising of this, this arises. <br />
This not being, this does not exist, <br />
With the cessation of this, this ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the cessation of things arisen from a cause is ultimately Nibbāna
itself. That is the implication of the oft recurrent phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn188-1"><a href="sermon-05.html#fn-fn188">41</a></sup></p>
<p>with the complete fading away and cessation of that very ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then, from this discussion it should be clear that our illustration with the
help of the simile of the cinema and the theatre is of much relevance to an
understanding of the law of dependent arising. With this much, we shall wind up
today.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>In our last sermon, we happened to discuss how the concept of existence built up
with the help of ignorance and influxes, comes to cease with the cessation of
ignorance and influxes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn190-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn190">2</a></sup> We explained it by means of similes and
illustrations, based on the film show and the drama. As the starting point, we
took up the simile of the picture called <em>caraṇa</em>, which the Buddha had made use
of in the <em>Gaddulasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn191-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn191">3</a></sup> With reference to a
picture called <em>caraṇa</em>, popular in contemporary India, the Buddha has declared
that the mind is more picturesque than that <em>caraṇa</em> picture. As an adaptation
of that <em>caraṇa</em> picture for the modern day, we referred to the movie film and
the drama in connection with our discussion of <em>saṅkhāras</em> in particular and
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> in general. Today, let us try to move a little forward in
the same direction.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the same Second <em>Gaddulasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>,
<em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>, the Buddha gives a simile of a painter.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn192-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn192">4</a></sup> Translated it
would read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as a dyer or a painter would fashion the likeness of a woman or of a man,
complete in all its major and minor parts, on a well planed board, or a wall,
or on a strip of cloth, with dye or lac or turmeric or indigo or madder, even
so the untaught worldling creates, as it were, his own form, feelings,
perceptions, preparations, and consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the Buddha wants to convey to us by this comparison of the five grasping
groups to an artefact done by a painter, is the insubstantiality and the vanity
of those five groups. It brings out their compound and made-up nature. This
essencelessness and emptiness is more clearly expressed in the
<em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>. The summary verse at the end of
that discourse would suffice for the present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamaṁ rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vedanā bubbuḷūpamā,</em> <br />
<em>marīcikūpamā saññā,</em> <br />
<em>saṅkhārā kadalūpamā,</em> <br />
<em>māyūpamañca viññāṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpitādiccabandhunā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn193-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn193">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It says that the Buddha, the kinsman of the sun, has compared form to a mass of
foam, feeling to a water bubble, perception to a mirage, preparations to a
banana trunk, and consciousness to a magic show. These five similes bring out
the insubstantiality of the five grasping groups. Their simulating and deceptive
nature is indicated by the similes. Not only the magic show, but even the other
similes, like the mass of foam, are suggestive of simulation, in giving a false
notion of compactness. They all convey the idea of insubstantiality and
deceptiveness. Consciousness in particular, is described in that context as a
conjurer’s trick.</p>
<p>In the course of our discussion we happened to touch upon the significance of
<em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations. As far as their relevance to films and dramas is
concerned, they impart an appearance of reality to ‘parts’ and ‘acts’ which make
up a film or a drama. Realism, in the context of art and drama, amounts to an
apparent reality. It connotes the skill in deceiving the audience. It is, in
fact, only a show of reality. The successful drama is one that effectively
hoodwinks an audience. So realism, in that context, means appearing as real. It
therefore has a nuance of deception.</p>
<p>Now what supports this deceptive and delusive quality of preparations is
ignorance. All this ‘acting’ that is going on in the world is kept up by
ignorance, which provides the background for it. Just as, in a drama, such
preparations as change of dress, make-up contrivances, character portrayal, and
stage-craft, create an atmosphere of delusion, so also are the <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or
preparations, instrumental in building up these five grasping groups. So all
this goes to show that the term <em>saṇkhāra</em> has the sense of preparing or
producing. The realistic appearance of a film or a drama is capable of creating
a delusion in an audience. Similarly, the apparent reality of the animate and
inanimate objects in the world, creates delusion in the worldlings.</p>
<p>Now to hark back to two lines of a verse we had quoted earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>mohasambandhano loko, bhabbarūpo va dissati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn194-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn194">6</a></sup></p>
<p>the world appears as real to one who is fettered to delusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the world has an apparent reality, that it merely gives the
impression of something real to one who is deluded. It is clear, therefore, that
<em>saṅkhāras</em> are responsible for some sort of preparation or concoction. What
serves as the background for it, is the darkness of ignorance. This preparation,
this concoction goes on, behind the veil of ignorance.</p>
<p>We come across a discourse in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, in which this primary sense
of preparation in the word <em>saṅkhāra</em> is explicitly stated, namely the
<em>Khajjanīyasutta</em>. In that discourse, each of the five grasping groups is
defined, and the term <em>saṅkhāra</em> is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiñca, bhikkhave, saṅkhāre vadetha? ’Saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharontī’ti kho,
bhikkhave, tasmā ’saṅkhārā’ti vuccanti. Kiñca saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharonti? Rūpaṁ
rūpattāya saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharonti, vedanaṁ vedanattāya saṅkhatam
abhisaṅkharonti, saññaṁ saññattāya saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharonti, saṅkhāre
saṅkhārattāya saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharonti, viññāṇaṁ viññāṇattāya saṅkhatam
abhisaṅkharonti. ’Saṅkhatam abhisaṅkharontī’ti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā
’saṅkhārā’ti vuccanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn195-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn195">7</a></sup></p>
<p>And what, monks, would you say are ‘preparations’? They prepare the prepared –
that, monks, is why they are called preparations. And what is the prepared
that they prepare? They prepare, as a prepared, form into the state of form,
they prepare, as a prepared, feeling into the state of feeling, they prepare,
as a prepared, perception into the state of perception, they prepare, as a
prepared, preparations into the state of preparations, they prepare, as a
prepared, consciousness into the state of consciousness. They prepare the
prepared, so, that is why, monks, they are called preparations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains why <em>saṅkhāras</em> are so called. That is to say, the sense in which
they are called <em>saṅkhāras</em>. They prepare the prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>, into that
state. And the prepared is form, feeling, perception, preparations, and
consciousness. <em>Saṅkhāras</em> are therefore instrumental in building up each of
these grasping groups. The most intriguing statement is that even the
<em>saṅkhāras</em> are built up by <em>saṅkhāras</em>. They play the part of preparing a sort
of make-believe activity. In this sense it is associated with the idea of
intention, as being produced by intention.</p>
<p>The two terms <em>abhisaṅkhataṁ abhisañcetayitaṁ</em> are often found in juxtaposition,
as if they are synonymous.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn196-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn196">8</a></sup> <em>Abhisaṅkhata</em> means ‘specially prepared’,
and <em>abhisañcetayitaṁ</em> means ‘thought out’ or ‘intended’. Here we see the
relationship of <em>saṅkhāras</em> to intention.</p>
<p>The preparation is done by means of intentions. The two words <em>ceteti</em>
<em>pakappeti</em> are also found used together.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn197-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn197">9</a></sup> Intention and imagination play
their part in this matter of preparation. So in the last analysis, it is
something constructed by imagination. All of these five groups are
thought-constructs. As suggested by the similes of the picture and the painter,
these five groups, in the final reckoning, turn out to be the products of
imagination.</p>
<p>As far as the nature of these preparations is concerned, there are these three
kinds of preparations mentioned in the Dhamma, namely <em>kāyasaṅkhāra,
vacīsaṅkhāra</em>, and <em>manosaṅkhāra</em>, bodily preparations, verbal preparations, and
mental preparations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn198-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn198">10</a></sup> These terms have to do with merit and demerit. They
are cited in connection with <em>kamma</em>, implying that beings accumulate <em>kamma</em> by
means of body, word and mind.</p>
<p>What supports this heaping up of preparations is ignorance. Ignorance provides
the background, as in the case of the drama and the movie. This relationship
between ignorance and preparations is clearly brought out in the <em>Cetanāsutta</em>
of the <em>Sañcetaniyavagga</em> of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn199-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn199">11</a></sup></p>
<p>According to that sutta, the world attributes an activity to something by
regarding it as a unit – by perceiving it as a compact unit. In other words, it
is the way of the world to superimpose the concept of a unit or self-agency to
wherever there appears to be some sort of activity. As we mentioned in
connection with the simile of the whirlpool, viewed from a distance, the
whirlpool appears as a centre or a base.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn200-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn200">12</a></sup> In the same way, wherever there
appears to be some form of activity, we tend to bring in the concept of a unit.</p>
<p>Now it is this very ignorance, this ‘ignoring’, that becomes the seed-bed for
preparations. The basic presumption of this ignorance is that preparations must
originate from a unitary centre. And the Buddha also points out, in the
<em>Cetanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sañcetaniyavagga</em>, that the root cause of bodily, verbal,
and mental preparations, is ignorance. Since the discourse is rather
lengthy, we propose to analyse it in three sections, for facility of
understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kāye vā, bhikkhave, sati kāyasañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ.
Vācāya vā, bhikkhave, sati vācīsañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ.
Mane vā, bhikkhave, sati manosañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ
avijjāpaccayā va</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn201-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn201">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, when the body is there, due to bodily intention, there arises inward
pleasure and pain. Monks, when speech is there, due to verbal intention, there
arises inward pleasure and pain. Monks, when mind is there, due to mental
intention, there arises inward pleasure and pain, all conditioned by
ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let us take this as the first section and try to get at its meaning. Given
the concept of a body, due to intentions based on that concept of a body, there
arises inwardly pleasure and pain. That is, when one imagines that there is a
body, due to thoughts which take body as their object, one experiences pleasure
and pain. What is called ‘the body’, is a huge mass of activity, something like
a big workshop or a factory.</p>
<p>But because of ignorance, if one takes it as one thing, that is as a unit, then
there is room for bodily intention to come in. One can objectify the body and
arouse thoughts of the body. Thereby one experiences pleasure and pain. This is
the implication of the above statement.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of speech, it may be said that language is a
conglomeration of letters and words. But when speech is taken as a real unit,
one can form intentions about speech and inwardly experience pleasure and pain.
So also in the case of the mind. It is not an entity by itself, like a soul, as
postulated by other religions. It is again only a heap of thoughts. But if one
grants that there is a mind, due to that very presumption, one experiences
inwardly pleasure and pain with mind as its object. The concluding phrase of
that paragraph is particularly significant. It says that all this is conditioned
by ignorance.</p>
<p>Let us now take up the second part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sāmaṁ vā taṁ, bhikkhave, kāyasaṅkhāraṁ abhisaṅkharoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ
uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ. Pare vāssa taṁ, bhikkhave, kāyasaṅkhāraṁ
abhisaṅkharonti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ.
Sampajāno vā taṁ, bhikkhave, kāyasaṅkhāraṁ abhisaṅkharoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ
uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ. Asampajāno vā taṁ, bhikkhave, kāyasaṅkhāraṁ
abhisaṅkharoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Either he himself prepares that bodily preparation, owing to which there would
be that inward pleasure and pain. Or else others prepare for him that bodily
preparation, owing to which there would be for him inward pleasure and pain.
Either he, being fully aware, prepares that bodily preparation, owing to which
there would be for him inward pleasure and pain. Or else he, being fully
unaware, prepares that bodily preparation, owing to which there would be for
him that inward pleasure and pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substance of this paragraph seems to be that one by oneself prepares the
bodily preparation that brings one pleasure or pain inwardly and that others
also prepare for him such a bodily preparation. It is also said that the bodily
preparation can occur either with or without awareness. About the verbal and
mental preparations too, a similar specification is made. This is the summary of
the second section.</p>
<p>The third and final section is the most significant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imesu, bhikkhave, dhammesu avijjā anupatitā. Avijjāya tveva
asesavirāganirodhā so kāyo na hoti yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ
sukhadukkhaṁ, sā vācā na hoti yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ
sukhadukkhaṁ, so mano na hoti yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ
sukhadukkhaṁ, khettaṁ taṁ na hoti, vatthum taṁ na hoti, āyatanaṁ taṁ na hoti,
adhikaraṇaṁ taṁ na hoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Monks, in all these cases, ignorance hangs on. But with the remainderless
fading away and cessation of ignorance, that body is not there, owing to which
there can arise for him inward pleasure or pain, that speech is not there,
owing to which there can arise for him inward pleasure and pain, that mind is
not there, owing to which there can arise for him inward pleasure and pain.
That field is not there, that site is not there, that base is not there, that
reason is not there, owing to which there can arise for him inward pleasure or
pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since all the instances mentioned earlier are accompanied by ignorance, the
utter fading away and cessation of that very ignorance prevents, as it were, the
crystallization of that body, speech, and mind, due to which inward pleasure and
pain can arise. In other words, it removes the field, the ground, the base and
the provenance for the arising of inward pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>This shows that, once the existence of a body is granted, with that concept of a
body as its object, bodily preparations come to be built up. Or, in other words,
given the concept of a body, and due to bodily intention, that is by treating it
as a real unit, one experiences inwardly pleasure and pain because of thoughts
concerning the body.</p>
<p>So also in regard to speech and mind. It is emphatically stated that all this
occurs because of ignorance. What confers on them all the status of a unit,
through the perception of the compact, is this very ignorance. As for the second
paragraph, what it says is simply that those bodily preparations and the like
can be made by oneself as well as by others, and that too either being aware or
unaware.</p>
<p>Now all these are related to ignorance. Therefore, at whatever point of time
this ignorance ceases completely in someone, then for him there is no
consciousness of a body, though from an outside point of view he appears to have
a body. He may use words, he may speak, but for him there is nothing substantial
in linguistic usage. He seems to be making use of a mind, mind-objects also come
up, but he does not regard it as a unit. Therefore, inwardly, no pleasures and
pains come up.</p>
<p>With the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of preparations. Thereby all
pleasures and pains cease. This, in other words, is the state of Nibbāna. It
appears, then, that this discourse gives us a clue to the state of Nibbāna. It
says something about bodily, verbal, and mental preparations.</p>
<p>If we try to understand its message in relation to the analogy of the film show
and the drama, mentioned earlier, we may offer the following explanation: Now in
the case of a film show or a drama, the preparations remain as preparations so
long as there is that darkness of ignorance. The realism or the realistic
appearance of the acting of actors and actresses, or the roles and guises they
assume in dress and speech, depends on the veil of ignorance that conceals their
true nature.</p>
<p>Similarly, here too, the implication is that it is ignorance which invests these
preparations with the realistic appearance. If at any point of time that
ignorance happens to cease, then there will be no pleasure or displeasure for
the audience, however much make-up and pretension there is.</p>
<p>It is such a situation of non-enjoyment that we happened to mention in the
previous sermon with reference to the witnessing of a hill-top festival by
Upatissa and Kolita.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn202-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn202">14</a></sup> They had a flash of insight due to the light of
wisdom that came from within, not due to any illumination from outside. Because
of it, those preparations ceased to be preparations. From this we can understand
that the term <em>saṅkhāra</em> becomes meaningful only against the background of
ignorance.</p>
<p>To move a step further, it is against the background of both ignorance and
preparations that all the subsequent links in the formula become meaningful. As
far as the interrelation between consciousness and name-and-form is concerned,
all what we have said above regarding the reflection of name-and-form on
consciousness,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn203-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn203">15</a></sup> becomes meaningful only so long as the reality of
preparations is granted, that is, only so far as their deceptive nature is
maintained. But that deceptive nature owes its existence to ignorance. This way
we can unravel one aspect of the essential significance of the term <em>saṅkhāra</em>.</p>
<p>Then there is another point worth considering in this respect. <em>Saṅkhāra</em> as the
second link in the <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> formula is defined by the Buddha in the
<em>Vibhaṅgasutta</em> in the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> not in terms of <em>kāyasaṅkhāra</em>,
<em>vacīsaṅkhāra</em>, and <em>manosaṅkhāra</em>, but as <em>kāyasaṅkhāro</em>, <em>vacīsaṅkhāro</em>, and
<em>cittasaṅkhāro</em>. This might seem rather intriguing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katame ca, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā? Tayome, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā – kāyasaṅkhāro,
vacīsaṅkhāro, cittasaṅkhāro</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn204-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn204">16</a></sup></p>
<p>What, monks, are preparations? Monks, there are these three preparations –
body-preparation, speech-preparation, and mind-preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, it is noteworthy that here the term is given in the singular. In the
majority of instances it is found in the plural number, but here in the
definition of the term the singular is used as <em>kāyasaṅkhāro</em>, <em>vacīsaṅkhāro</em>,
and <em>cittasaṅkhāro</em>.</p>
<p>The significance of this usage is explained for us by the <em>Cūḷavedallasutta</em>, in
the Dhamma discussion between the <em>arahant</em> nun Dhammadinnā and the lay disciple
Visākha. There the venerable Therī, in answer to a question raised by the lay
disciple, comes out with a definition of these three terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Assāsapassāsā kho, āvuso Visākha, kāyikā, ete dhammā kāyappaṭibaddhā, tasmā
assāsapassāsā kāyasaṅkhāro.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn205-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn205">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend Visākha, in-breaths and out-breaths are bodily, these things are bound
up with the body, that is why in-breaths and out-breaths are a
body-preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to this interpretation, in-breathing and out-breathing are a
body-preparation in the sense that their activity is connected with the body.
There is no explicit mention of karma here.</p>
<p>Then the definition of <em>vacīsaṅkhāro</em> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pubbe kho, āvuso Visākha, vitakketvā vicāretvā pacchā vācaṁ bhindati, tasmā
vitakkavicārā vacīsaṅkhāro.</em></p>
<p>Friend Visākha, first having thought and pondered one breaks into speech, that
is why thinking and pondering are a speech-preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <em>vacīsaṅkhāra</em> is defined as thinking and pondering, not in terms of karma
such as abusive speech and the like.</p>
<p>Then, as the third, <em>cittasaṅkhāro</em> is given the following definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññā ca vedanā ca cetasikā ete dhammā cittappaṭibaddhā, tasmā saññā ca
vedanā ca cittasaṅkhāro</em>.</p>
<p>Perception and feeling are mental, they are bound up with the mind, that is
why perception and feeling are a mind-preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perception and feeling are called a mind-preparation because they are mental and
have to do with the mind.</p>
<p>According to this definition it appears, then, that what the Buddha had
indicated as the second link of the formula of dependent arising, is
in-breathing and out-breathing, thinking and pondering, and perception and
feeling. The mode of interpretation, we have adopted, shows us that the word
<em>saṅkhāra</em>, in the context of a drama, for instance, can mean preparations or
some sort of preliminary arrangement or fashioning.</p>
<p>Now this sense of preparation is applicable to in-breaths and out-breaths too.
As we know, in all our bodily activities, particularly in lifting some weight
and the like, or when exerting ourselves, we sometimes take a deep breath,
almost impulsively. That is to say, the most basic activity of this body is
in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the definition of <em>vacīsaṅkhāro</em> it is clearly stated that one
speaks out having first thought out and pondered. This is a clear instance of
the role of <em>saṅkhāra</em> as a ‘preparation’ or a preliminary activity. Now the
word ‘rehearsal’ is in common use in the society. Sometimes, the day before a
drama is staged for the society, a sort of trial performance is held. Similarly,
before breaking out into speech, one thinks and ponders. That is why sometimes
we find words issuing out before we can be aware of it. Thinking and pondering
is called <em>vacīsaṅkhāro</em>, because they ‘prepare’ speech. The sense of
‘preparation’ is therefore quite apt.</p>
<p>Then there is perception and feeling, for which the term <em>cittasaṅkhāro</em> is used
here, instead of <em>manosaṅkhāra</em>. The reason for it is that what we reckon as
<em>manosaṅkhāra</em> is actually the more prominent level represented by intentions
and the like. The background for those intentions, the subliminal preparatory
stage, is to be found in perception and feeling. It is perception and feeling
that give the impetus for the arising of the more prominent stage of intention.
They provide the necessary mental condition for doing evil or good deeds. This
way, we can get at the subtle nuances of the term <em>saṅkhāra</em>. Just as in the
case of an iceberg floating in the ocean, the greater part is submerged and only
a fraction of it shows above the surface, so also the deeper nuances of this
term are rather imperceptible.</p>
<p>Beneath our heap of body actions, verbal actions, and mental acts of willing or
intentions lies a huge mountain of activities. Breathing in and breathing out is
the most basic activity in one’s life. It is, in fact, the criterion for judging
whether one is alive or dead. For instance, when someone falls in a swoon, we
examine him to see whether he is still breathing, whether this basic activity is
still there in him. Also, in such a case, we try to see whether he can speak and
feel, whether perception and feeling are still there in him. So in this way we
can understand how these basic forms of activity decide the criterion for
judging whether life is present or extinct in a person.</p>
<p>That activity is something internal. But even at that level, defilements lie
dormant, because ignorance is hiding there too. In fact, that is precisely why
they are reckoned as <em>saṅkhāra</em>. Usually, one thinks in terms of ‘I’ and ‘mine’,
as: ‘I breathe’, ‘I speak’, ‘I see’, and ‘I feel’. So, like the submerged
portion of an iceberg, these subtler layers of preparations also have ignorance
hidden within them. That is why the attempt of pre-Buddhistic ascetics to solve
this <em>saṁsāric</em> riddle by tranquillity alone met with failure.</p>
<p>Pre-Buddhistic ascetics, and even Ālāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, thought
that they can get out of this <em>saṁsāra</em> by tranquillizing the bodily activities,
the verbal activities, and the mental activities. But they did not understand
that all these are <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations, therefore they were confronted
with a certain dilemma. They went on calming down the bodily activities to
subtler and subtler levels. They calmed down the in-breaths and out-breaths,
they managed to suppress thinking and pondering by concentration exercises, but
without proper understanding. It was only a temporary calming down.</p>
<p>However, once they reached the level of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
they had to face a certain problem. In fact, the very designation of that level
of attainment betrays the dilemma they were in. It means that one is at a loss
to say definitely whether there is some perception or not. The <em>Pañcattayasutta</em>
clearly reveals this fact. It gives expression to the problem facing those
ascetics in the following significant statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññā rogo saññā gaṇḍo saññā sallaṁ, asaññā sammoho, etaṁ santaṁ etaṁ paṇītaṁ
yadidaṁ nevasaññānāsaññaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn206-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn206">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Perception is a disease, perception is a boil, perception is a dart, but not
to have perception is to be deluded, this is peaceful, this is excellent, that
is, neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They understood to some extent that this perception is a disease, a trouble, a
tumour, or a wound, or else a thorn, they wanted to be free from perception. But
then, on the other hand, they feared that to be totally free from perception is
to be in a deluded state. Therefore they concluded: “This is peaceful, this is
excellent, that is neither-perception-nor-non-perception”, and came to a halt
there. That is why the Buddha rejected even Ālāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta
and went in search of the stilling of all preparations.</p>
<p>So the kind of tranquillity meditation followed by the pre-Buddhistic ascetics,
through various higher knowledges and meditative attainments, could never bring
about a stilling of all preparations. Why? Because the ignorance underlying
those preparations were not discernible to their level of wisdom. In the least,
they could not even recognize their <em>saṅkhāra</em> nature. They thought that these
are only states of a soul. Therefore, like the present day Hindu Yogins
following the philosophy of the <em>Upaniśads</em>, they thought that breathing is just
one layer of the self, it is one of the outer rinds of the soul.</p>
<p>In fact, the ‘kernel’ of self was supposed to have around it the four rinds,
<em>annamaya, prāṇamaya, saṁjñamaya,</em> and <em>vijñāṇamaya</em>. That is to say, made out
of food, breath, perception, and consciousness, respectively. Apart from
treating them as states of a self, they were not able to understand that all
these activities are <em>saṅkhāras</em> and that ignorance is the spring-board for
them.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Nibbāna is called the stilling of all preparations,
<em>sabbasaṅkhārasamatha</em>, one might sometimes conclude that the attainment of the
cessation of perceptions and feeling, <em>saññāvedayitanirodha</em>, is in itself
Nibbāna. But it is on rising from that attainment, which is like a deep freeze,
that one makes contact with the three deliverances, the signless, <em>animitta</em>,
the desireless, <em>appaṇihita</em>, and the void, <em>suññata</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Buddhist outlook, it is wisdom that decides the issue, and not
tranquillity. Therefore, in the last analysis, preparations cease to be
preparations when the tendency to grasp the sign in the preparations is got rid
of and signlessness is experienced. The ‘sign’ stands for the notion of
permanence and it accounts for the deceptive nature of preparations, as in the
case of an actor’s make-up and stage-craft. It is the sign of permanence that
leads to a desire for something, to expectations and aspirations.</p>
<p>So that sign has to leave together with the desire, for the Desireless
Deliverance to come about. Then one has to see all this as essenceless and void.
It is just because of desire that we regard something as ‘essence-tial’. We ask
for the purpose of something, when we have desire. Now it is through this unique
vision of the Signless, the Desireless, and the Void, that the Buddha arrived at
the state of stilling of all preparations.</p>
<p>We resort to the simile of the film show and the drama not out of disregard for
the precept concerning abstention from such diversions, but because the Buddha
has called dancing a form of mad behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ummattakam idaṁ, bhikkhave, ariyassa vinaye yadidaṁ naccaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn207-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn207">19</a></sup></p>
<p>This, monks, is a form of madness according to the noble one’s discipline,
namely dancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is the nature of a madman? He is jumpy. From the standpoint of Dhamma,
dancing is a form of jumpiness. In fact, all preparations are that. It shows a
nervous stress as well as a nervous release. It is an endless series of winding
and unwinding.</p>
<p>What makes this problem of <em>saṁsāra</em> such a knotty one to solve? We go on
heaping up karmic actions, but when the time comes to experience their
consequences, we do not regard them as mere results of karma, but superimpose an
‘I’ on that experience. So we act with the notion of an ‘I’ and react to the
consequences again with the notion of an ‘I’. Because of that egoistic reaction,
we heap up fresh karma. So here is a case of stress and release, of winding and
rewinding.</p>
<p>This is like a tangled skein. Sometimes, when an unskilled person tries to
disentangle a tangled skein while disentangling one end, the other end gets
entangled. So it is, in the case of this <em>saṁsāric</em> ball of thread. While doing
a karma, one is conscious of it as “I am doing it”. And when it is the turn to
suffer for it, one does not think it as a result of that karma. Consequently one
accumulates fresh karma through various attachments and conflicts arising out of
it. Here too we see some sort of a drama.</p>
<p>Now if one can get the opportunity to see either a rehearsal or the back-stage
preparations for a drama, which however is not usually accessible to the public,
one would be able to see through the drama. If one can steal a peep into the
back-stage make-up contrivances of actors and actresses, one would see how ugly
persons can become comely and the wretched can appear regal. One would then see
what a ‘poor show’ it is.</p>
<p>In the same way there is something dramatic in these basic preparations, namely
– in-breathing and out-breathing, thinking and pondering, perception and
feeling. If one sees these back-stage preparations with wisdom, one would be
disenchanted. What tranquillity meditation does, is to temporarily calm them
down and derive some sort of happiness. That too is necessary from the point of
view of concentration, to do away with restlessness and the like, but it does
not dispel ignorance. That is why, in insight meditation, one tries to
understand preparations for what they are by dispelling ignorance.</p>
<p>The more one sees preparations as preparations, ignorance is dispelled, and the
more one dispels ignorance, the preparations lose their significance as
preparations. Then one sees the nature of preparations with wisdom as signless,
desireless, and void. So much so that, in effect, preparations cease to be
preparations.</p>
<p>This is something of a marvel. If we now hark back to the two words ‘winding’
and ‘rewinding’, the entire world, or <em>saṁsāric</em> existence in its entirety, is a
process of winding and rewinding. Where the winding ends and the rewinding
begins is a matter beyond our comprehension. But one thing is clear – all these
comes to cease when craving and grasping are abandoned. It is towards such an
objective that our minds turn by recognizing preparations for what they are, as
a result of a deeper analysis of their nature.</p>
<p>The relation of <em>saṅkhāras</em> to ignorance is somewhat similar to the relation a
drama has to its back-stage preparations. It seems, then, that from the
standpoint of Dhamma the entire <em>saṁsāra</em> is a product of specifically prepared
intentions, even like the drama with its back-stage preparations.</p>
<p>Let us return to the simile of the cinema again. The average man, when he says
that he has seen a film show, what he has actually seen is just one scene
flashing on the screen at a time. As we happened to mention in an earlier
sermon, people go to the cinema and to the theatre saying:</p>
<p>“We are going to see a film show, we are going to see a drama”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn208-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn208">20</a></sup> And they
return saying: “We have seen a film show, we have seen a drama”. But actually,
they have neither seen a film nor a drama completely.</p>
<p>What really has happened? How did they see a film show? Just as much as one
creates a name-and-form on one’s screen of consciousness with the help of
preparations, the film-goer has created a story by putting together the series
of scenes falling on the screen.</p>
<p>What we mean to say is this: Now supposing the series of consecutive frames,
which make up a motion picture, is made to appear on the scene when there is no
spectator in the cinema hall – will there be a film at all? While such an
experiment is going on, if a film-goer steps in late, half way through, he would
not be able to gather that portion of the film already gone. It is gone, gone,
gone forever. Those preparations are irrevocably past.</p>
<p>A film show actually becomes a film show thanks to that glue used by the
audience – the glue of craving. The Buddha has preached that this craving has
three characteristics, namely: <em>ponobhavika, nandirāgasahagata</em>, and
<em>tatratatrābhinandi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn209-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn209">21</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Ponobhavika</em> as a characteristic of craving means, in its broader sense, that
it leads to re-becoming. One might think that by ‘re-becoming’ only the
connecting up of one existence in <em>saṁsāra</em> with another is meant. But that is
not all. It is craving that connects up one moment of existence with another.</p>
<p>One who is seeing a film show, for instance, connects up the first scene with
the second, in order to understand the latter. And that is how one ‘sees’ a film
show and comes back and says: “I have seen a film show”. All the scenes do not
fall on the screen at once, but a connecting-up goes on. That is the idea behind
the term <em>ponobhavika</em>. In this connecting up of one scene with another there is
an element of re-becoming or re-generation.</p>
<p>Then there is the term <em>nandirāgasahagata</em>. This is the other additive which
should be there for one to enjoy the film show. It means the nature of
delighting and getting attached.</p>
<p>Craving in particular is like a glue. In fact, a synonym for it is <em>lepa</em>, which
means a ‘glue’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn210-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn210">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Another synonym is <em>visattika</em>, an ‘adhesive’ or a ‘sticky substance’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn211-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn211">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Even the word <em>rāga</em>, or attachment, already conveys this sense. So craving, or
desire, glues the scenes together.</p>
<p>Then comes the term <em>tatratatrābhinandi</em>, the nature of delighting, in
particular now here, now there. It is, in effect, the association of one scene
with another in order to make up a story out of it. That is why we made the
statement: “So far not a single cinema has held a film show and not a single
theatre has staged a drama”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn212-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn212">24</a></sup></p>
<p>But all the same, those who went to the cinema and the theatre witnessed a show
and a drama. How? They produced them, or prepared them, with their ‘sticky’
defilements on their own.</p>
<p>Now in the same way, worldly beings create a film show of name-and-form on the
screen of consciousness with the help of preparations, or <em>saṅkhāras</em>.
Name-and-form is a product of imagination. What insight meditators often refer
to as reflection on ‘name-and-form preparations’, amounts to this. Is there
something real in name-and-form? In our very first sermon we happened to say
something on this point.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn213-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn213">25</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> the Buddha gives utterance
to the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anattani attamāniṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passa lokaṁ sadevakaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>niviṭṭhaṁ nāmarūpasmiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>idaṁ saccan’ti maññati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn214-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn214">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Just see the world, with all its gods, <br />
Fancying a self where none exists, <br />
Entrenched in name-and-form it holds <br />
The conceit that this is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is as if the Buddha is pinpointing the illusory and deceptive nature of
name-and-form. As we mentioned before, scenes fall on the cinema screen only one
at a time. Because of the rapidity of the movie film, it is difficult for one to
be aware of this fact.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of a drama, the curtain goes down between acts and the audience
waits for the curtain to go up. But they wait, ready with their glue to connect
the previous act with the one to come, to construct a drama. By the time a
certain scene falls on the cinema screen, the previous one is gone for good.
Scenes to follow have not yet come. Whatever scene falls on the screen, now,
will not stay there. So what we have here, is something illusory, a deceptive
phenomenon.</p>
<p>Let us now consider an instance like this: Sometimes we see a dog, crossing a
plank over a stream, stopping half way through to gaze at the water below. It
wags its tail, or growls, or keeps on looking at and away from the water, again
and again. Why does it do so? Seeing its own image in the water, it imagines
that to be another dog. So it either wags its tail in a friendly way, or growls
angrily, or else it keeps on stealing glances out of curiosity – love, hate, and
delusion.</p>
<p>In this case, the dogs thinks that it is looking because it sees a dog. But what
is really happening? It is just because it is looking that it sees a dog. If the
dog had not looked down, it would not have seen a dog looking up at it from
below, that is to say – its own image.</p>
<p>Now it is precisely this sort of illusion that is going on with regard to this
name-and-form, the preparations, and sense-perception. <strong>Here lies the secret of
Dependent Arising</strong>.</p>
<p>As a flash-back to our film show, it may be added that if a film reel is played
at a time when there is no spectator, no film show will be registered anywhere,
because there is no mind to put together. It merely flashed on the screen. But
if someone had been there to receive it, to contact with his sense-bases, that
is, to see with his eyes, hear with his ears, and make mental contact with
desire, then there comes to be a film show. And so also in the case of a drama.</p>
<p>Film producers and dramatists think that the production of the film and the
drama is solely their work. But in the last analysis, it is the audience that
gives the film and the drama the finishing touch, to make them finished
products. Similarly, we tend to think that every object in the world exists in
its own right. But then this is what is called <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, the ‘personality
view’, which carries with it the self-bias.</p>
<p>It is such a view that made the dog imagine that there is another dog in the
water. It imagined that the dog is there, even when it is not looking. It may
have thought: “I am looking because a dog appears there”. But the fact is that
the dog appears there because it cares to look. Here, then, we have a case of
dependent arising, or <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>The word <em>paṭicca</em> has a very deep meaning. The Buddha borrowed many words from
the existing philosophical tradition in India. Sometimes he infused new meanings
into them and adopted them to his terminology. But the term <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>
is not to be found in any other philosophical system. The special significance
of the term lies in the word <em>paṭicca</em>.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion, the Buddha himself gave a definition to this term
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. Now it is fairly well known that the Buddha declared that
all this suffering is dependently arisen. What then is to be understood by the
word <em>dukkha</em>, or ‘suffering’?</p>
<p>He defines it in terms of the five grasping groups, or the five aggregates of
clinging, as it is said: <em>saṅkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn215-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn215">27</a></sup> “in
short, the five grasping groups are suffering”. So then suffering, or the five
grasping groups, is something dependently arisen.</p>
<p>In one discourse in the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> we find the
Buddha making the following significant statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppannaṁ kho, Upavāṇa, dukkhaṁ vuttaṁ mayā. Kiṁ paṭicca? Phassaṁ
paṭicca.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn216-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn216">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Upavāṇa, I have declared that suffering is dependently arisen. Dependent on
what? <strong>Dependent on contact</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from this statement, also, it is clear that the five groups of grasping arise
because of contact, that is by contacting through the six bases.</p>
<p>Considered in this way, a thing is called dependently arisen because it arises
on being touched by the six sense-bases. That is why it is called <em>anicca</em>, or
impermanent. The film show, for instance, was not something already made, or
‘ready made’. It arose due to contact. The phrase <em>saṅkhataṁ
paṭiccasamuppannaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn217-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn217">29</a></sup> ‘prepared and dependently arisen’, suggests that
the prepared nature is also due to that contact. What may be called
<em>abhisaṅkhata viññāṇa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn218-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn218">30</a></sup> ‘specifically prepared consciousness’, is that
sort of consciousness which gets attached to name-and-form.</p>
<p>When one sees a film show, one interprets a scene appearing on the screen
according to one’s likes and dislikes. It becomes a thing of experience for him.
Similarly, by imagining a self in name-and-form, consciousness gets attached to
it. It is such a consciousness, which is established on name-and-form, that can
be called <em>abhisaṅkhata viññāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>Then could there be also a consciousness which does not reflect a name-and-form?
Yes, there could be. That is what is known as <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn219-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn219">31</a></sup> or
‘non-manifestative consciousness’. This brings us to an extremely abstruse topic
in this Dhamma.</p>
<p>There is a very deep verse occurring at the end of the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em> of the
<em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> which has been variously interpreted by scholars both eastern and
western. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>ettha dīghañca rassañca,</em> <br />
<em>aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇassa nirodhena,</em> <br />
<em>etth’etaṁ uparujjhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn220-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn220">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary advances several interpretations to this verse.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn221-1"><a href="sermon-06.html#fn-fn221">33</a></sup> Being
unable to give one definite meaning, it suggests several. However, since we have
developed a certain mode of interpretation so far, we propose to give preference
to it before getting down to the commentarial interpretation. Now let us see
whether our mode of interpretation can make this verse meaningful.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to trace the circumstances which provide the setting for
this verse in the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em>. The Buddha brings out a past episode,
relating to the company of monks. A certain monk conceived the riddle: “Where do
these four great primaries, earth, water, fire, and air, cease altogether?” He
did not approach the Buddha with his problem, probably because he thought that
somewhere in this world-system those four elements could cease.</p>
<p>So what did he do? As he had psychic powers he went from heaven to heaven and
Brahma realm to Brahma realm, asking the gods and Brahmas this question: “Where
do these four primaries cease?” None among the gods and Brahmas could answer. In
the end, Mahā Brahma himself asked him, why he took the trouble to come all the
way there, when he could have easily consulted the Buddha. Then that monk
approached the Buddha and put the riddle to him.</p>
<p>But before answering the riddle, the Buddha recommended a restatement of it,
saying: “Monk, that is not the way you should put it. You should have worded it
differently.” Now that means that the question is wrongly put. It is incorrect
to ask where the four great primaries cease. There is a particular way of
wording it. And this is how the Buddha reformulated that riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>kattha dīghañca rassañca,</em> <br />
<em>aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati?</em></p>
<p>Where do earth and water, <br />
Fire and wind no footing find, <br />
Where is it that long and short, <br />
Fine and coarse, pleasant, unpleasant, <br />
As well as name-and-form, <br />
Are held in check in a way complete?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha introduces a phrase of special significance: <em>na gādhati</em>, ‘does
not find a footing’. So the question, as restated, means: “Where do the four
primaries not get a footing?”</p>
<p>The question, then, is not about a cessation of the four primaries, it is not a
question of their cessation somewhere in the world or in the world system. The
correct way to put it, is to ask where the four great primaries do not find a
footing.</p>
<p>The Buddha adds that it may also be asked where long and short, fine and coarse,
pleasant and unpleasant, as well as name-and-form are held in check completely.
The word <em>uparujjhati</em> means ‘holding in check’.</p>
<p>Having first reformulated the question, the Buddha gave the answer to it in the
verse previously quoted. Let us now try to get at the meaning of this verse. We
shall not translate, at the very outset, the first two lines of the verse,
<em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em>. These two lines convey a very
deep meaning. Therefore, to start with, we shall take the expression as it is,
and explain its relation to what follows.</p>
<p>It is in this consciousness, which is qualified by the terms <em>anidassanaṁ,
anantaṁ</em>, and <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, that earth, water, fire, and air do not find a
footing. Also, it is in this consciousness that long and short, fine and coarse,
and pleasant and unpleasant, as well as name-and-form, are kept in check. It is
by the cessation of consciousness that all these are held in check.</p>

<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. Towards the end of the last sermon we happened
to quote a certain verse from the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. The
verse runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />

<em>etth’etaṁ uparujjhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn223-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn223">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other day, we could give only a general idea of the meaning of this verse in
brief, because of the question of time. Today, we propose to attempt a detailed
explanation of it. To start with, we purposely avoid rendering the first two
lines, which appear as the crux of the whole verse. Taking those two lines as
they are, we could paraphrase the verse as follows:</p>
<p>It is in a consciousness, that is <em>anidassana, ananta,</em> and <em>sabbato pabha</em>,
that earth, water, fire, and air do not find a footing. It is in this
consciousness that long and short, fine and coarse, and pleasant and unpleasant,
as well as name-and-form, are kept in check. It is by the cessation of
consciousness that all these are held in check.</p>
<p>Let us now try to sort out the meaning of the difficult words in the first two
lines. First of all, in the expression <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>, there is the term
<em>anidassana</em>. The meaning of the word <em>nidassana</em> is fairly well known. It means
‘illustration’. Something that ‘throws light on’ or ‘makes clear’ is called
<em>nidassana</em>. This is the basic sense.</p>
<p>We find an instance of the use of this word, even in this basic sense, in the
first <em>Kosalasutta</em> among the Tens of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>. It is in
connection with the description of <em>abhibhāyatanā</em>, bases of mastery, where
there is a reference to contemplation devices known as <em>kasiṇa</em>. It is said that
even the flax flower can be used initially as a sign for <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation. A
flax flower is described in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Umāpupphaṁ nīlaṁ nīlavaṇṇaṁ nīlanidassanaṁ nīlanibhāsaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn224-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn224">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be rendered as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flax flower, blue, blue-coloured, manifesting blue, shining blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Nīlanidassanaṁ</em> suggests that the flax flower is an illustration of blue
colour, or that it is a manifestation of blue. <em>Anidassana</em> could therefore be
said to refer to whatever does not manifest anything.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a very good example in support of this suggested sense in the
<em>Kakacūpamasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. There we find the Buddha putting a
certain question to the monks in order to bring out a simile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, suppose a man comes with crimson, turmeric, indigo or carmine and says:</p>
<p>‘I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear on the sky!’</p>
<p>What do you think, monks, could that man draw pictures and make pictures
appear there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the monks reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayañhi, bhante, ākāso arūpī anidassano. Tattha na sukaraṁ rūpaṁ likhituṁ,
rūpapātubhāvaṁ kātuṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn225-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn225">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This sky, Lord, is immaterial and non-illustrative. It is not easy to draw a
picture there or make manifest pictures there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have the words in support of the above suggested meaning. The sky is
said to be <em>arūpī anidassano</em>, immaterial and non-illustrative. That is why one
cannot draw pictures there or make pictures appear there. There is nothing
material in the sky to make manifest pictures. That is, the sense in which it is
called <em>anidassano</em> in this context.</p>
<p>Let us now see how meaningful that word is, when used with reference to
consciousness as <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>. Why the sky is said to be
non-manifestative we could easily understand by the simile. But how can
consciousness become non-manifestative?</p>
<p>First and foremost we can remind ourselves of the fact that our consciousness
has in it the ability to reflect. That ability is called <em>paccavekkhana</em>,
‘looking back’. Sometimes the Buddha has given the simile of the mirror with
reference to this ability, as for instance in the <em>Ambalatthikā Rāhulovādasutta</em>
of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn226-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn226">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <em>Ānandasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>, also, he has used the simile of
the mirror.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn227-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn227">6</a></sup></p>
<p>In the former sutta preached to Venerable Rāhula the Buddha uses the simile of
the mirror to stress the importance of reflection in regard to bodily, verbal,
and mental action.</p>
<p>In our last sermon, we gave a simile of a dog crossing a plank over a stream and
looking at its own reflection in the water.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn228-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn228">7</a></sup> That, too, is a kind of
reflection. But from that we can deduce a certain principle with regard to the
question of reflection, namely, that the word stands for a mode of becoming
deluded as well as a mode of getting rid of the delusion. What creates a
delusion is the way that dog is repeatedly looking down from his own point of
view on the plank to see a dog in the water.</p>
<p>That is unwise reflection born of non-radical attention, <em>ayoniso manasikāra</em>.
Under the influence of the personality view, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, it goes on looking
at its own image, wagging its tail and growling. But wise reflection born of
radical attention, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, is what is recommended in the
<em>Ambalatthikā Rāhulovādasutta</em> with its thematic repetitive phrase
<em>paccavekkhitvā, paccavekkhitvā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn229-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn229">8</a></sup> ‘reflecting again and again’.</p>
<p>Wise reflection inculcates the Dhamma point of view. Reflection based on Right
View, <em>sammā diṭṭhi</em>, leads to deliverance. So this is the twin aspect of
reflection. But this we mention by the way. The point we wish to stress is that
consciousness has in it the nature of reflecting something, like a mirror.</p>
<p>Now <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em> is a reference to the nature of the released
consciousness of an <em>arahant</em>. It does not reflect anything. To be more precise,
it does not reflect a <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, or name-and-form.</p>
<p>An ordinary individual sees a <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, when he reflects, which he calls ‘I’
and ‘mine’. It is like the reflection of that dog, which sees its own delusive
reflection in the water. A <em>non-arahant</em>, upon reflection, sees name-and-form,
which however he mistakes to be his self. With the notion of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ he
falls into delusion with regard to it. But the <em>arahant’s</em> consciousness is an
unestablished consciousness.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned in previous sermons about the established
consciousness and the unestablished consciousness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn230-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn230">9</a></sup> A <em>non-arahant’s</em>
consciousness is established on name-and-form.</p>
<p>The unestablished consciousness is that which is free from name-and-form and is
unestablished on name-and-form. The established consciousness, upon reflection,
reflects name-and-form, on which it is established, whereas the unestablished
consciousness does not find a name-and-form as a reality.</p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> has no attachments or entanglements in regard to name-and-form. In
short, it is a sort of penetration of name-and-form, without getting entangled
in it. This is how we have to unravel the meaning of the expression <em>anidassana
viññāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>By way of further clarification of this sense of <em>anidassana</em>, we may remind
ourselves of the fact that manifestation requires something material. That is
obvious even from that simile picked up at random from the <em>Kakacūpamasutta</em>. As
for the consciousness of the <em>arahant</em>, the verse in question makes it clear
that earth, water, fire, and air do not find a footing there.</p>
<p>It is because of these four great primaries that one gets a perception of form.
They are said to be the cause and condition for the designation of the aggregate
of form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cattāro kho, bhikkhu, mahābhūtā hetu, cattāro mahābhūtā paccayo
rūpakkhandhassa paññāpanāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn231-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn231">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The four great primaries, monk, are the cause and condition for the
designation of the form group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the <em>arahant</em> has freed his mind from these four elements. As it is said in
the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyā cittaṁ virājeti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn232-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn232">11</a></sup></p>
<p>he makes his mind dispassionate with regard to the earth-element.</p>
<p><em>Āpodhātuyā cittaṁ virājeti</em>,</p>
<p>he makes his mind dispassionate with regard to the water-element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he has freed his mind from the four elements through disenchantment, which
makes them fade away, the <em>arahant’s</em> reflection does not engender a perception
of form. As the verse in question puts it rather rhetorically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī, tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em></p>
<p>herein water and earth, fire and air find no footing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the word <em>gādhati</em> is particularly significant. When, for instance, we want
to plumb the depth of a deep well, we lower something material as a plumb into
the well. Where it comes to stay, we take as the bottom. In the consciousness of
the <em>arahant</em>, the material elements cannot find such a footing. They cannot
manifest themselves in that unplumbed depth of the <em>arahant’s</em> consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati.</em></p>
<p>Consciousness, which is non-manifestative, <br />
Endless and lustrous on all sides, <br />
It is here that water, earth, <br />
Fire, and air no footing find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is precisely because the material elements cannot make themselves manifest in
it, that this consciousness is called ‘non-manifestative’. In the same
connection we may add that such distinctions as long and short, fine and coarse,
and pleasant and unpleasant are not registered in that consciousness, because
they pertain to things material. When the consciousness is freed from the four
elements, it is also free from the relative distinctions, which are but the
standards of measurements proper to those elements.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the implications of the term <em>anantaṁ</em> – ‘endless’,
‘infinite’. We have already said something about the plumbing of the depth of
waters. Since the material elements have faded away in that consciousness, they
are unable to plumb its depth. They no longer serve as an ‘<strong>index</strong>’ to that
consciousness. Therefore, that consciousness is endless or infinite.</p>
<p>It is endless also in another sense. With regard to such distinctions as ‘long’
and ‘short’ we used the word ‘<strong>relative</strong>’. These are relative concepts. We
even refer to them as conjoined pairs of terms. In worldly usage they are found
conjoined as ‘long and short’, ‘fine and coarse’, ‘pleasant and unpleasant’.
There is a dichotomy about these concepts, there is a bifurcation. It is as if
they are put within a rigid framework.</p>
<p>When, for instance, we go searching for a piece of wood for some purpose or
other, we may say: “This piece of wood is too long”. Why do we say so? Because
we are in need of a shorter one. Instead of saying that it is not
‘<strong>sufficiently</strong>’ short, we say it is too long. When we say it is too short,
what we mean is that it is not sufficiently long. So then, long and short are
relevant within one framework. As a matter of fact, all measurements are
relative to some scale or other. They are meaningful within some framework of a
scale.</p>
<p>In this sense, too, the worldling’s way of thinking has a tendency to go to
extremes. It goes to one extreme or the other. When it was said that the world,
for the most part, rests on a dichotomy, such as that between the two views ‘Is’
and ‘Is not’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn233-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn233">12</a></sup> this idea of a framework is already implicit. The
worldling’s ways of thought ‘<strong>end-up</strong>’ in one extreme or the other within this
framework. The <em>arahant</em> transcends it, his consciousness is, therefore,
endless, <em>ananta</em>.</p>
<p>There is a verse in the <em>Pāṭaligāmiyavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>, which clearly brings
out this fact. Most of the discourses in that section of the <em>Udāna</em> deal with
Nibbāna – <em>Nibbānapaṭisaṁyutta</em> – and the following verse, too, is found in such
a discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Duddasaṁ anantaṁ nāma,</em> <br />
<em>na hi saccaṁ sudassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>paṭividdhā taṇhā jānato,</em> <br />
<em>passato natthi kiñcanaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn234-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn234">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse, like many other deep ones, seems to have puzzled the commentators.
Let alone the meaning, even the variant readings had posed them a problem, so
much so that they end up giving the reader a choice between alternate
interpretations. But let us try to get at the general trend of its meaning.</p>
<p><em>Duddasaṁ anantaṁ nāma,</em> “hard to see is the endless” – whatever that ‘endless’ be.</p>
<p><em>Na hi saccaṁ sudassanaṁ,</em> “the truth is not easily seen”, which in effect is an
emphatic assertion of the same idea. One could easily guess that this ‘endless’
is the truth and that it refers to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>Paṭividdhā taṇhā</em> means that “craving has been penetrated through”. This
penetration is through knowledge and wisdom, the outcome of which is stated in
the last line.</p>
<p><em>Janato passato natthi kiñcanaṁ</em>, “to one who know and sees there is NOTHING”.
The idea is that when craving is penetrated through with knowledge and wisdom,
one realizes the voidness of the world. Obviously, the reference here is to
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The entire verse may now be rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard to see is the Endless, <br />
Not easy ’tis to see the truth, <br />
Pierced through is craving, <br />
And naught for him who knows and sees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentator, however, is at a loss to determine whether the correct reading
is <em>anataṁ</em> or <em>anantaṁ</em> and leaves the question open. He gives one
interpretation in favour of the reading <em>anataṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn235-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn235">14</a></sup></p>
<p>To show its justifiability he says that <em>natā</em> is a synonym for <em>taṇhā</em>, or
craving, and that <em>anataṁ</em> is a term for Nibbāna, in the sense that there is no
craving in it. It must be pointed out that it is <em>nati</em> and not <em>natā</em> that is
used as a synonym for <em>taṇhā</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, after adducing reasons for the acceptability of the reading <em>anataṁ</em>, he
goes on to say that there is a variant reading, <em>anantaṁ</em>, and gives an
interpretation in support of it too. In fact, he interprets the word <em>anantaṁ</em>
in more than one sense. Firstly, because Nibbāna is permanent, it has no end.
And secondly it is endless because it is immeasurable, or <em>appamāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>In our interpretation of the word <em>anantaṁ</em> we have not taken it in the sense of
permanence or everlastingness. The word <em>appamāṇa</em>, or immeasurable, can have
various nuances. But the one we have stressed is the transcendence of relative
concepts, limited by their dichotomous nature. We have also alluded to the
unplumbed depth of the <em>arahant’s</em> consciousness, in which the four elements do
not find a footing.</p>
<p>In the <em>Buddhavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em> we come across another verse which
highlights the extraordinary significance of the word <em>anantaṁ</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa jālinī visattikā,</em> <br />
<em>taṇhā natthi kuhiñci netave,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ Buddham anantagocaraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>apadaṁ kena padena nessatha?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn236-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn236">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before attempting a translation of this verse, some of the words in it have to
be commented upon.</p>
<p><em>Yassa jālinī visattikā:</em> <em>Jālinī</em> is a synonym for craving. It means one who
has a net or one who goes netting. <em>Visattikā</em> refers to the agglutinative
character of craving. It keeps worldlings glued to objects of sense. The verse
may be rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who has no craving, with nets in and agglutinates to lead him somewhere –
by what track could that Awakened One of infinite range be led – trackless as
he is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the Buddha is of infinite range, he is trackless. His path cannot be
traced. Craving wields the net of name-and-form with its glue when it goes
ranging. But since the Awakened One has the ‘<strong>endless</strong>’ as his range, there is
no track to trace him by.</p>
<p>The term <em>anantagocaraṁ</em> means one whose range has no end or limit. If, for
instance, one chases a deer, to catch it, one might succeed at least at the end
of the pasture. But the Buddha’s range is endless and his ‘ranging’ leaves no
track.</p>
<p>The commentators seem to interpret this term as a reference to the Buddha’s
omniscience – to his ability to attend to an infinite number of objects.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn237-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn237">16</a></sup>
But this is not the sense in which we interpret the term here. The very fact
that there is ‘<strong>no object</strong>’ makes the Buddha’s range endless and untraceable.
Had there been an object, craving could have netted him in.</p>
<p>In support of this interpretation, we may allude to the following couple of
verses in the <em>Arahantavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi,</em> <br />
<em>ye pariññāta bhojanā,</em> <br />
<em>suññato animitto ca,</em> <br />
<em>vimokkho yesa gocaro,</em> <br />
<em>ākāse va sakuntānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>gati tesaṁ durannayā.</em></p>
<p><em>Yassāsavā parikkhīṇā,</em> <br />
<em>āhāre ca anissito,</em> <br />
<em>suññāto animitto ca,</em> <br />
<em>vimokkho yassa gocaro,</em> <br />
<em>ākāse va sakuntānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn238-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn238">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both verses express more or less the same idea. Let us examine the meaning of
the first verse. The first two lines are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi, ye pariññāta bhojanā</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have no accumulation and who have comprehended their food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words used here are charged with deep meanings. Verses in the <em>Dhammapada</em>
are very often rich in imagery. The Buddha has on many occasions presented the
Dhamma through deep similes and metaphors. If the metaphorical sense of a term
is ignored, one can easily miss the point.</p>
<p>For instance, the word <em>sannicaya</em>, in this context, which we have rendered as
‘accumulation’, is suggestive of the heaping up of the five aggregates. The word
<em>upacaya</em> is sometimes used with reference to this process of heaping up that
goes on in the minds of the worldlings.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn239-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn239">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Now this heaping up, as well as the accumulation of <em>kamma</em>, is not there in the
case of an <em>arahant</em>. Also, they have comprehended their food. The comprehension
of food does not mean simply the usual reflection on food in terms of elements.
Nor does it imply just one kind of food, but all the four nutriments mentioned
in the Dhamma, namely <em>kabaḷiṅkārāhāra</em>, material food, <em>phassa</em>, contact,
<em>manosañcetanā</em>, volition, and <em>viññāṇa</em>, consciousness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn240-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn240">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The next two lines tell us what the true range or pasture of the <em>arahants</em> is.
It is an echo of the idea of comprehension of food as well as the absence of
accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suññato animitto ca, vimokkho yesa gocaro</em>,</p>
<p>whose range is the deliverance of the void and the signless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <em>arahants</em> are in their attainment to the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>, their
minds turn towards the void and the signless. When they are on this
feeding-ground, neither Māra nor craving can catch them with their nets. They
are trackless – hence the last two lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ākāse va sakuntānaṁ, gati tesa durannayā,</em></p>
<p>their track is hard to trace, like that of birds in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>gati</em> in this last line is interpreted by the commentators as a
reference to the ‘whereabouts’ of the <em>arahants</em> after their
<em>parinibbāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn241-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn241">20</a></sup></p>
<p>It has dubious associations of some place as a destination. But in this context,
<em>gati</em> does not lend itself to such an interpretation. It only refers to their
mental compass, which is untraceable, because of their deliverance trough the
void and the signless.</p>
<p>The next verse also bring out this idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassāsavā parikkhīṇā, āhāre ca anissito,</em></p>
<p>whose influxes are extinct and who is unattached in regard to nutriment.</p>
<p><em>Suññāto animitto ca, vimokkho yassa gocaro,</em></p>
<p>whose range is the void and the signless.</p>
<p><em>Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ, padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>his path is hard to trace, like that of birds in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds us of the last line of the verse quoted earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>apadaṁ kena padena nessatha</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn242-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn242">21</a></sup></p>
<p>by what track could one lead him, who is trackless?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two verses, then, throw more light on the meaning of the expression
<em>anantagocara</em> – of infinite range – used as an epithet for the Awakened One.</p>
<p>Let us now get at the meaning of the term <em>sabbato pabham</em>, in the context
<em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn243-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn243">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In our discussion of the significance of the drama and the cinema we mentioned
that it is the darkness in the background which keeps the audience entranced in
a way that they identify themselves with the characters and react
accordingly.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn244-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn244">23</a></sup> The darkness in the background throws a spell of delusion.
That is what makes for ‘enjoyment’.</p>
<p>Of course, there is some sort of light in the cinema hall. But that is very
limited. Some times it is only a beam of light, directed on the screen. In a
previous sermon we happened to mention that even in the case of a matinee show,
dark curtains and closed doors and windows ensure the necessary dark
background.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn245-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn245">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Here, in this simile, we have a clue to the meaning <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, luminous
or lustrous on all sides. Suppose a matinee show is going on and one is enjoying
it, entranced and deluded by it. Suddenly doors and windows are flung open and
the dark curtains are removed. Then immediately one slips out of the cinema
world. The film may go on, but because of the light coming from all sides, the
limited illumination on the screen fades away, before the total illumination.
The film thereby loses its enjoyable quality.</p>
<p>As far as consciousness, or <em>viññāṇa</em>, is concerned, it is not something
completely different from wisdom, <em>paññā</em>, as it is defined in the
<em>Mahāvedallasutta</em>. However, there is also a difference between them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>paññā bhāvetabbā, viññāṇaṁ pariññeyyaṁ,</em></p>
<p>wisdom is to be developed, consciousness is to be comprehended.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn246-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn246">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is said that one has to comprehend the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>Then one may ask: “We are understanding everything with consciousness, so how
can one understand consciousness?” But the Buddha has shown us the way of doing
it.</p>
<p>Wisdom, when it is developed, enables one to comprehend consciousness. In short,
consciousness is as narrow as that beam of light falling on the cinema screen.
That is to say, the specifically prepared consciousness, or the consciousness
crammed up in name-and-form, as in the case of the <em>non-arahant</em>. It is as
narrow as the perspective of the audience glued to the screen. The consciousness
of the ordinary worldling is likewise limited and committed.</p>
<p>Now what happens when it is fully illuminated on all sides with wisdom? It
becomes <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, lustrous an all sides. In that lustre, which comes
from all sides, the framework of ignorance fades away. It is that released
consciousness, free from the dark framework of ignorance, that is called the
consciousness which is lustrous on all sides, in that cryptic verse in question.
This lustre, associated with wisdom, has a special significance according to the
discourses. In the <em>Catukkanipāta</em> of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> we come across the
following sutta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Catasso imā, bhikkhave, pabhā. Katamā catasso? Candappabhā, suriyappabhā,
aggippabhā, paññāpabhā</em>. <em>Imā kho, bhikkhave, catasso pabhā. Etad aggaṁ,
bhikkhave, imāsaṁ catunnaṁ pabhānaṁ yadidaṁ paññāpabhā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn247-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn247">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these four lustres. Which four? The lustre of the moon, the
lustre of the sun, the lustre of fire, and the lustre of wisdom. These, monks,
are the four lustres. This, monks, is the highest among these four lustres,
namely the lustre of wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important discourse, quoted quite often, though not always correctly
interpreted, is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pabhassaram idaṁ, bhikkhave, cittaṁ. Tañca kho āgantukehi upakkilesehi
upakkiliṭṭhaṁ. Taṁ assutavā puthujjano yathābhūtaṁ nappajānāti. Tasmā
assutavato puthujjanassa citta bhāvanā natthī’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p><em>Pabhassaram idaṁ, bhikkhave, cittaṁ. Tañca kho āgantukehi upakkilesehi
vippamuttaṁ. Taṁ sutavā ariyasāvako yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti. Tasmā sutavato
ariyasāvakassa citta bhāvanā atthī’ti vadāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn248-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn248">27</a></sup></p>
<p>This mind, monks, is luminous, but it is defiled by extraneous defilements.
That, the uninstructed ordinary man does not understand as it is. Therefore,
there is no mind development for the ordinary man, I declare.</p>
<p>This mind, monks, is luminous, but it is released from extraneous defilements.
That, the instructed noble disciple understands as it is. Therefore, there is
mind development for the instructed noble disciple, I declare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is sufficiently clear, then, that the allusion is to the luminous mind, the
consciousness of the <em>arahant</em>, which is non-manifestative, infinite, and all
lustrous. To revert to the analogy of the cinema which, at least in a limited
sense, helps us to form an idea about it, we have spoken about the stilling of
all preparations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn249-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn249">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Now in the case of the film, too, there is a stilling of preparations. That is
to say, the preparations which go to make it a ‘<strong>movie</strong>’ film are
‘<strong>stilled</strong>’. The multicoloured dresses of actors and actresses become
colourless before that illumination, even in the case of a technicolour film.
The scenes on the screen get blurred before the light that suddenly envelops
them.</p>
<p>And what is the outcome of it? The preparations going on in the minds of the
audience, whether induced by the film producers or aroused from within, are
calmed down at least temporarily. This symbolizes, in a limited sense, the
significance of the phrase <em>sabbasaṅkhārasamatha</em>, the stilling of all
preparations.</p>
<p>Then what about the relinquishment of all assets, <em>sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga</em>? In
the context of the film show, it is the bundle of experiences coming out of
one’s ‘vested-interests’ in the marvellous cinema world. These assets are
relinquished at least for the moment. Destruction of craving, <em>taṇhakkhayo</em>, is
momentarily experienced with regard to the blurred scenes on the screen.</p>
<p>As to the term <em>virāga</em>, we have already shown that it can be understood in two
senses, that is, dispassion as well as the fading away which brings about the
dispassion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn250-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn250">29</a></sup> Now in this case, too, the fading away occurred, not by any
other means, but by the very fact that the limited narrow beam of consciousness
got superseded by the unlimited light of wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Nirodha</em> means cessation, and the film has now ceased to be a film, though the
machines are still active. We have already mentioned that in the last analysis a
film is produced by the audience.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn251-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn251">30</a></sup> So its cessation, too, is a matter for
the audience. This, then, is the cessation of the film.</p>
<p>Now comes Nibbāna, extinction or extinguishment. Whatever heated emotions and
delirious excitements that arose out of the film show cooled down, at least
momentarily, when the illumination takes over. This way we can form some idea,
somewhat inferentially, about the meaning and significance of the term <em>sabbato
pabhaṁ</em>, with the help of this illustration based on the film show.</p>
<p>So now we have tackled most of the difficulties to the interpretation of this
verse. In fact, it is the few words occurring in the first two lines that has
posed an insoluble problem to scholars both eastern and western. We have not yet
given the commentarial interpretation, and that, not out of disrespect for the
venerable commentators. It is because their interpretation is rather hazy and
inconclusive. However, we shall be presenting that interpretation at the end of
this discussion, so as to give the reader an opportunity to compare it with
ours.</p>
<p>But for the present, let us proceed to say something about the last two lines as
well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇassa nirodhena, etth’etaṁ uparujjhati</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw above, for all practical purposes, name-and-form seem to cease, even
like the fading away of the scenes on the cinema screen. Then what is meant by
this phrase <em>viññāṇassa nirodhena</em>, with the cessation of consciousness?</p>
<p>The reference here is to that <em>abhisaṅkhata viññāṇa</em>, or the specifically
prepared consciousness. It is the cessation of that concocted type of
consciousness which was formerly there, like the one directed on the cinema
screen by the audience. With the cessation of that specifically prepared
consciousness, all constituents of name-and-form are said to be held in check,
<em>uparujjhati</em>.</p>
<p>Here, too, we have a little problem. Generally, <em>nirujjhati</em> and <em>uparujjhati</em>
are regarded as synonymous. The way these two verbs are used in some suttas
would even suggest that they mean the same thing. As a matter of fact, even the
<em>Cūḷa Niddesa</em>, which is a very old commentary, paraphrases <em>uparujjhati</em> by
<em>nirujjhati</em>: “<em>uparujjhatī’ti nirujjhati</em>”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn252-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn252">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the context of this particular verse, there seems to be
something deep involved in the distinction between these two verbs. Even at a
glance, the two lines in question are suggestive of some distinction between
them.</p>
<p><em>Viññāṇassa nirodhena, etth’etaṁ uparujjhati</em>, the <em>nirodha</em> of consciousness is
said to result in the <em>uparodha</em> of whatever constitutes name-and-form. This is
intriguing enough.</p>
<p>But that is not all. By way of preparing the background for the discussion, we
have already made a brief allusion to the circumstances in which the Buddha
uttered this verse.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn253-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn253">32</a></sup> What provided the context for its utterance was a
riddle that occurred to a certain monk in a moment of fancy. The riddle was:
“Where do these four great primaries cease altogether?” There the verb used is
<em>nirujjhanti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn254-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn254">33</a></sup></p>
<p>So in order to find where they cease, he whimsically went from heaven to heaven
and from Brahma-world to Brahma-world. As we mentioned earlier, too, it was when
the Mahā Brahma directed that monk to the Buddha, saying: “Why ‘on earth’ did
you come all this way when the Buddha is there to ask?”, that the Buddha
reworded the question. He pointed out that the question was incorrectly worded
and revised it as follows, before venturing to answer it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>kattha dīghañca rassañca,</em> <br />
<em>aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn255-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn255">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word used by the Buddha in this revised version is <em>uparujjhati</em> and not
<em>nirujjhati</em>.</p>
<p>Yet another innovation is the use of the term <em>na gādhati</em>. Where do water,
earth, fire, and air find no footing? Or where do they not get established? In
short, here is a word suggestive of plumbing the depth of a reservoir. We may
hark back to the simile given earlier, concerning the plumbing of the
consciousness with the perception of form. Where do the four elements not find a
footing? Also, where are such relative distinctions as long and short, subtle
and gross, pleasant and unpleasant, as well as name-and-form, completely held in
check?</p>
<p>In this restatement of the riddle, the Buddha has purposely avoided the use of
the verb <em>nirujjhati</em>. Instead, he had recourse to such terms as <em>na gādhati</em>,
‘does not find a footing’, ‘does not plumb’, and <em>uparujjhati</em>, ‘is held in
check’, or ‘is cut off’. This is evidence enough to infer that there is a subtle
distinction between the nuances associated with the two verbs <em>nirujjhati</em> and
<em>uparujjhati</em>.</p>
<p>What is the secret behind this peculiar usage? The problem that occurred to this
monk is actually of the type that the materialists of today conceive of. It is,
in itself, a fallacy. To say that the four elements <strong>cease</strong> somewhere in the
world, or in the universe, is a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Why? Because the very question: “Where do they cease?”, presupposes an answer in
terms of those elements, by way of defining that place. This is the kind of
uncouth question an ordinary materially inclined person would ask.</p>
<p>That is why the Buddha reformulated the question, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monk, that is not the way to put the question. You should not ask ‘where’ the
four great primaries cease, but rather where they, as well as the concepts of
long and short, subtle and gross, pleasant and unpleasant, and name-and-form,
are held in check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question proper is not where the four great primaries cease, but where they
do not get established and where all their accompaniments are held in check.</p>
<p>Here, then, we see the Buddha relating the concept of matter, which the world
takes for granted, to the perception of form arising in the mind. The four great
primaries haunt the minds of the worldlings like ghosts, so they have to be
exorcised from their minds. It is not a question of expelling them from this
world, or from any heavenly realm, or the entire world-system. That exorcism
should take place in this very consciousness, so as to put an end to this
haunting.</p>
<p>Before the light of wisdom those ghosts, namely the four great primaries, become
ineffective. It is in the darkness of ignorance that these ghosts haunt the
worldlings with the perception of form. They keep the minds of the worldlings
bound, glued, committed and limited. What happens now is that the specifically
prepared consciousness, which was bound, glued, committed and limited, becomes
fully released, due to the light of wisdom, to become non-manifestative,
endless, and lustrous on all sides.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, we may render the verse in question as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness, which is non-manifestative, <br />
Endless, lustrous on all sides, <br />
Here it is that earth and water, <br />
Fire and air no footing find, <br />
Here it is that long and short, <br />
Fine and coarse, pleasant, unpleasant, <br />
And name-and-form, <br />
Are cut off without exception, <br />
When consciousness has surceased, <br />
These are held in check herein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we ventured to translate the verse, we have not yet given the
commentarial interpretation of it. Since this might seem a shortcoming, we shall
now present what the commentator has to say on this verse.</p>
<p>Venerable Buddhaghosa, before coming to this verse in his commentary to the
<em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em>, gives an explanation as to why the Buddha reformulated the
original question of that monk. According to him, the question: “Where do the
four great primaries cease?”, implied both the organic and the inorganic aspects
of matter, and in revising it, the Buddha limited its scope to the organic.</p>
<p>In other words, Venerable Buddhaghosa presumes that the revised version has to
be interpreted with reference to this human body. Hence he explains such words
as ‘long’ and ‘short’, occurring in the verse, in a limited sense as referring
to the body’s stature. How facile this interpretation turns out to be, one can
easily discern as we go on.</p>
<p>Venerable Buddhaghosa keeps on reminding the reader that the questions are
relevant only to the organic realm, <em>upādinnaṁ yeva sandhāya pucchati</em>. <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn256-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn256">35</a></sup>
So he interprets the terms <em>dīghañca rassañca</em>, long and short, as relative
distinctions of a person’s height, that is tallness and shortness. Similarly,
the words <em>aṇuṁ thūlaṁ,</em> subtle and gross, are said to mean the small and big in
the size of the body. Likewise <em>subha</em> and <em>asubhaṁ</em> are taken to refer to the
comely and the ugly in terms of body’s appearance.</p>
<p>The explanation given to the phrase <em>nāmañca rūpañca</em> is the most astounding of
all. <em>Nāma</em> is said to be the name of the person and <em>rūpa</em> is his form or
shape. All this goes to show that the commentator has gone off at a tangent,
even in the interpretation of this verse, which is more or less the prologue to
such an intricate verse as the one in question. He has blundered at the very
outset in limiting the scope of those relative terms to the organic, thereby
obscuring the meaning of that deep verse.</p>
<p>The significance of these relative terms, from the linguistic point of view, has
been overlooked. Words like <em>dīghaṁ / rassaṁ</em> and <em>aṇuṁ / thūlaṁ</em> do not refer
to the stature and size of some person. What they convey is the dichotomous
nature of concepts in the world.</p>
<p>All those deeper implications are obscured by the reference to a person’s
outward appearance. The confusion becomes worse confounded, when <em>nāmañca
rūpañca</em> is interpreted as the name and the shape of a person. So the stage is
already set for a shallow interpretation, even before presenting the verse
beginning with <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It is on such an unsound premise that the commentator bases his interpretation
of the verse in question. We shall try to do justice to that exposition, too. It
might necessitate a fair amount of quotations, though it is difficult to be
comprehensive in this respect.</p>
<p>The commentator begins his exposition with the word <em>viññāṇaṁ</em> itself. He comes
out with a peculiar etymology: <em>Viññāṇan’ti tattha viññātabbanti viññāṇaṁ
nibbānassa nāmaṁ</em>, which means that the word <em>viññāṇa</em>, or consciousness, is in
this context a synonym for Nibbāna, in the sense that it is ‘to be known’,
<em>viññātabbaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>This forced etymology is far from convincing, since such a usage is not attested
elsewhere. Moreover, we come across a long list of epithets for Nibbāna, as many
as thirty-three, in the <em>Asaṅkhatasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, but
<em>viññāṇa</em> is not counted as one.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn257-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn257">36</a></sup> In fact, nowhere in the discourses is
<em>viññāṇa</em> used as a synonym for Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Next, he takes up the word <em>anidassana</em>, and makes the following comment: <em>Tad
etaṁ nidassanābhāvato anidassanaṁ</em>, that Nibbāna is called <em>anidassana</em> because
no illustration for it could be given. The idea is that it has nothing to
compare with. Then comes the explanation of the word <em>anantaṁ</em>. According to the
commentator Nibbāna is called <em>ananta</em>, endless, because it has neither the
arising-end, <em>uppādanto</em>, nor the falling-end, <em>vayanto</em>, nor the otherwiseness
of the persisting-end, <em>ṭhitassa aññathatta</em>. Strangely enough, even the last
mentioned middle-state is counted as an ‘end’ in the commentators concept of
three ends. So this is the substance of his commentary to the first three words
<em>viññāṇaṁ, anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>The commentarial interpretation of the term <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em> is even more
confusing. The word <em>pabhā</em> is explained as a synonym for <em>papa</em>, meaning
‘ford’. The <em>bha</em> element in the word, he explains, is a result of consonantal
interchange with the original <em>pa</em> in <em>papa</em>. <em>Pakārassa pana bhakāro kato</em>. The
idea is that the original form of this particular term for Nibbāna is <em>sabbato
papaṁ</em>. The meaning attributed to it is ‘with fords on all sides’. Nibbāna is
supposed to be metaphorically conceived as the ocean, to get down into which
there are fords on all sides, namely the thirty-eight topics of meditation.</p>
<p>This interpretation seems rather far fetched. It is as if the commentator has
resorted to this simile of a ford, because he is already ‘in deep waters’! The
word <em>pabhā</em>, as it is, clearly means light, or radiance, and its association
with wisdom is also well attested in the canon.</p>
<p>Though in his commentary to the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> Venerable Buddhaghosa advances
the above interpretation, in his commentary to the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> he seems to
have had second thoughts on the problem. In the <em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, also, the first two lines of the verse, <em>viññāṇaṁ
anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> occur.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn258-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn258">37</a></sup></p>
<p>But here the commentator follows a different line of interpretation. Whereas in
his commentary to the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em> he explains <em>anidassanaṁ</em> as an epithet of
Nibbāna, in the sense of having nothing to compare with, here he takes it in the
sense of not being visible to the eye. <em>Cakkhuviññāṇassa āpāthaṁ anupagamanato
anidassanaṁ nāma,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn259-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn259">38</a></sup> “it is called <em>anidassana</em> because it does not come
within the range of eye-consciousness”.</p>
<p>In explaining the term <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, he suggests several alternative
interpretations. In the first interpretation, he takes <em>pabhā</em> to mean light, or
lustre. <em>Sabbato pabhan’ti sabbato pabhāsampannaṁ. Nibbānato hi añño dhammo
sappabhataro vā jotivantataro vā parisuddhataro vā paṇḍarataro vā natthi.</em>
“<em>Sabbato pabhaṁ</em> means more lustrous than anything else. For there is nothing
more lustrous or luminous or purer or whiter than Nibbāna”. In this
interpretation Nibbāna is even regarded as something white in colour!</p>
<p>The etymology of the term <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em> has been given a twist, for the word
<em>sabbato</em> is taken in a comparative sense, ‘more lustrous than anything’. As we
have pointed out, the term actually means ‘lustrous on all sides’. Then a second
interpretation is given, bringing in the word <em>pabhū</em>, ‘lord’ or ‘chief’.
<em>Sabbato vā pabhū</em>, that is to say more prominent than anything else. In support
of it he says: <em>Asukadisāya nāma nibbānaṁ natthī’ti na vattabbaṁ</em>, “it should
not be said that in such and such a direction Nibbāna is not to be found”. He
says that it is called <em>pabhū</em>, or lord, because it is to be found in all
directions. Only as the third interpretation he cites his simile of the ford
already given in his commentary to the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em>.</p>
<p>What is the reason for giving so many figurative interpretations as alternatives
to such a significant verse? Surely the Buddha would not have intended the verse
to convey so many conflicting meanings, when he preached it.</p>
<p>No doubt the commentators have made a great effort to preserve the Dhamma, but
due to some unfortunate historical circumstances, most of the deep discourses
dealing with the subject of Nibbāna have been handed down without even a clue to
the correct version among variant readings.</p>
<p>This has left the commentators nonplussed, so much so that they had to give us
several vague and alternative interpretations to choose from. It is up to us to
decide, whether we should accept this position as it is, or try to improve on it
by exploring any other possible means of explanation.</p>
<p>We had occasion to mention in our very first sermon that the Buddha himself has
prophesied that those discourse which deal with voidness would, in time to come,
go into disuse, with their deeper meanings obscured.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn260-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn260">39</a></sup> The interpretations
just quoted go to show that already the prediction has come true to a great
extent.</p>
<p>The phrase we quoted from the <em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> with its reference to
<em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> occurs in a context which has a significance of its own.
The relevant paragraph, therefore, deserves some attention. It runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññānaṁ anidassanaṁ anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ, taṁ paṭhaviyā paṭhavittena
ananubhūtaṁ, āpassa āpattena ananubhūtaṁ, tejassa tejattena ananubhūtaṁ,
vāyassa vāyattena ananubhūtaṁ, bhūtānaṁ bhūtattena ananubhūtaṁ, devānaṁ
devattena ananubhūtaṁ, pajāpatissa pajāpatittena ananubhūtaṁ, brahmānaṁ
brahmattena ananubhūtaṁ, ābhassarānaṁ ābhassarattena ananubhūtaṁ,
subhakiṇhānaṁ subhakiṇhattena ananubhūtaṁ, vehapphalānaṁ vehapphalatte
ananubhūtaṁ, abhibhussa abhibhuttena ananubhūtaṁ, sabbassa sabbattena
ananubhūtaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn261-1"><a href="sermon-07.html#fn-fn261">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Consciousness which makes nothing manifest, infinite and all lustrous, it does
not partake of the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of water, the fieriness
of fire, the airiness of air, the creature-hood of creatures, the <em>deva</em>-hood
of <em>devas</em>, the Pajāpati-hood of Pajāpati, the Brahma-hood of Brahma, the
radiance of the Radiant Ones, the Subhakiṇha-hood of the Subhakiṇha Brahmas,
the Vehapphala-hood of the Vehapphala Brahmas, the overlord-ship of the
overlord, and the all-ness of the all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This peculiar paragraph, listing thirteen concepts, seems to convey something
deep about the nature of the non-manifestative consciousness. That consciousness
does not partake of the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of water, the
fieriness of fire, and the airiness of air. That is to say, the nature of the
four elements does not inhere in this consciousness, they do not manifest
themselves in it. Similarly, the other concepts, like <em>deva</em>-hood, Brahma-hood,
etc., which the worldlings take seriously as real, have no applicability or
validity here.</p>
<p>The special significance of this assertion lies in the context in which the
Buddha declared it. It is to dispel a wrong view that Baka the Brahma conceived,
in regarding his Brahma status as permanent, ever lasting and eternal, that the
Buddha made this declaration before that Brahma himself in the Brahma world.</p>
<p>The whole point of the discourse, then, is to challenge the wrong view of the
Brahma, by asserting that the non-manifestative consciousness of the <em>arahant</em>
is above the worldly concepts of elements and divinity and the questionable
reality attributed to them. In other words, they do not manifest themselves in
it. They are transcended.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>The other day we ended our sermon by discussing how far the
<em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> helps us to understand what
<em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is. We quoted a certain paragraph from that discourse as a
starting point for our discussion. Let us now remind ourselves of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññānaṁ anidassanaṁ anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ, taṁ paṭhaviyā paṭhavittena
ananubhūtaṁ, āpassa āpattena ananubhūtaṁ, tejassa tejattena ananubhūtaṁ,
vāyassa vāyattena ananubhūtaṁ, bhūtānaṁ bhūtattena ananubhūtaṁ, devānaṁ
devattena ananubhūtaṁ, pajāpatissa pajāpatittena ananubhūtaṁ, brahmānaṁ
brahmattena ananubhūtaṁ, ābhassarānaṁ ābhassarattena ananubhūtaṁ,
subhakiṇhānaṁ subhakiṇhattena ananubhūtaṁ, vehapphalānaṁ vehapphalattena
ananubhūtaṁ, abhibhussa abhibhuttena ananubhūtaṁ, sabbassa sabbattena
ananubhūtaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn263-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn263">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Consciousness which makes nothing manifest, infinite and all lustrous. It does
not partake of the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of water, the fieriness
of fire, the airiness of air, the creature-hood of creatures, the <em>deva</em>-hood
of <em>devas</em>, the Pajāpati-hood of Pajāpati, the Brahma-hood of Brahma, the
radiance of the Radiant Ones, the Subhakiṇha-hood of the Subhakiṇha Brahmas,
the Vehapphala-hood of the Vehapphala Brahmas, the overlord-ship of the
overlord, and the all-ness of the all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gist of this paragraph is that the non-manifestative consciousness which is
infinite and all lustrous, is free from the qualities associated with any of the
concepts in the list, such as the earthiness of earth and the wateriness of
water.</p>
<p>That is to say it is not under their influence, it does not partake of them,
<em>ananubhūtaṁ</em>. Whatever nature the world attributes to these concepts, whatever
reality they invest it with, that is not registered in this non-manifestative
consciousness. That is why this consciousness is said to be uninfluenced by
them.</p>
<p>Usually, the worldlings attribute a certain degree of reality to concepts in
everyday usage. These may be reckoned as mind-objects, things that the mind
attends to. The word <em>dhamma</em> also means ‘a thing’, so the worldling thinks that
there is some-‘thing’ in each of these concepts. Or, in other words, they
believe that there is some-thing as an inherent nature or essence in these
objects of the mind.</p>
<p>But the quotation in question seems to imply that this so-called nature is not
registered in the <em>arahant’s</em> mind. It is extremely necessary for the worldling
to think that there is some real nature in these mind-objects. Why? Because in
order to think of them as objects they have to have some essence, at least they
must be invested with an essence, and so the worldlings do invest them with some
sort of an essence, and that is the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of
water, (etc.). Likewise there is a being-hood in beings, a <em>deva</em>-hood in
<em>devas</em>, a Pajāpati-hood in Pajāpati, a Brahma-hood in Brahma, so much so that
even in the concept of all, there is an all-ness – and this is the worldlings’
standpoint.</p>
<p>Attributing a reality to whatever concept that comes up, the worldlings create
for themselves perceptions of permanence, perceptions of the beautiful, and
perceptions of self. In other words, they objectify these concepts in terms of
craving, conceit and views. That objectification takes the form of some inherent
nature attributed to them, such as earthiness, <em>deva</em>-hood (etc.).</p>
<p>But as for the non-manifestative consciousness, it is free from the so-called
natures that delude the worldlings. In the consciousness of the <em>arahants</em>,
there is not that infatuation with regard to the mass of concepts which the
worldlings imagine as real, in order to keep going this drama of existence.</p>
<p>This fact is clearly borne out by another statement in the
<em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em>. The Buddha makes the following declaration, to break
the conceit of Baka the Brahma, who conceived the idea of permanence regarding
his status as a Brahma:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ kho ahaṁ, brahme, paṭhavito abhiññāya yāvatā paṭhaviyā paṭhavittena
ananubhūtaṁ tadabhiññāya paṭhaviṁ nāhosim, paṭhaviyā nāhosiṁ, paṭhavito
nāhosiṁ, paṭhaviṁ me’ti nāhosiṁ, paṭhaviṁ nābhivadiṁ</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn264-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn264">3</a></sup></p>
<p>“Having understood through higher knowledge earth as earth, O Brahma,”</p>
<p>(that is to say having understood by means of a special kind of knowledge, and
not by means of the ordinary sense-perception)</p>
<p>“and having understood through higher knowledge whatever that does not partake
of the earthiness of earth”,</p>
<p>(the reference here is to that non-manifestative consciousness, which is to be
described in the passage to follow)</p>
<p>“I did not claim to be earth”, <em>paṭhaviṁ nāhosim</em>, <br />
“I did not claim to be on earth”, <em>paṭhaviyā nāhosiṁ</em>, <br />
“I did not claim to be from earth”, <em>paṭhavito nāhosiṁ</em>, <br />
“I did not claim earth as mine”, <em>paṭhaviṁ me’ti nāhosiṁ</em>, <br />
“I did not assert earth”, <em>paṭhaviṁ nābhivadiṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The declensional forms given here are also suggestive of the fact that once the
worldlings attribute some inherent nature to those concepts in terms of a
‘ness’, as in earthy-ness, and make them amenable to their cravings, conceits
and views, declensional forms come into usage, a few instances of which have
been mentioned here.</p>
<p>So, with regard to this earth, one can conceive of it as ‘my earth’, or as ‘I am
on earth’, or ‘I who am on the earth’, or ‘from the earth’. By holding on
tenaciously to these declensional forms of one’s own creation, one is only
asserting one’s ego.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, we all know that what is called ‘a flower’ is something that
can fade away. But when one conceives of it as ‘The-flower-I-saw’, and thereby
appropriates it into the concept of an I, it gets invested with the nature of
permanence, since it can be ‘re-called’. A perception of permanence which
enables one to think about it again, arises out of it. This is the idea behind
the above reference.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of the released mind not to take these concepts seriously.
It does not have a tenacious grasp on these declensional forms. It is convinced
of the fact that they are mere conventions in ordinary usage. Due to that
conviction itself, it is not subject to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I did not claim to be earth, I did not claim to be on earth, I did not claim
to be from earth, I did not claim earth as mine, I did not assert earth”,
<em>paṭhaviṁ nābhivadiṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the word <em>abhivadiṁ</em> is suggestive of conceit. The three terms
<em>abhinandati</em>, <em>abhivadati</em> and <em>ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati</em> are often mentioned
together in the discourses.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn265-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn265">4</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Abhinandati</em> means delighting in particular, which is suggestive of craving.</p>
<p><em>Abhivadati</em> means an assertion by way of conceit – an assertion which implies
‘a taking up’ of something.</p>
<p><em>Ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati</em> stands for dogmatic involvement regarding views.</p>
<p>Thus <em>abhinandati</em>, <em>abhivadati</em> and <em>ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati</em> correspond to the
three terms <em>taṇhā</em>, craving, <em>māna</em>, conceit, and <em>diṭṭhi</em>, views,
respectively.</p>
<p>Now out of these, what we find here is <em>abhivadati</em> – <em>paṭhaviṁ nābhivadiṁ</em>, “I
did not assert earth” – I did not make any assertion about earth by way of
conceit. From this, too, we can infer that the ordinary man in this world takes
his perception of the earth seriously, and by conceiving of it as ‘earth is
mine’, ‘I am on the earth’, (etc.), invests the concepts with a permanent
nature. But this is a kind of device the worldlings adopt in order to perpetuate
the drama of existence. However, everyone of these elements is void.</p>
<p>In this particular context, the four elements earth, water, fire and air, are
mentioned at the very outset. The Buddha, having understood the emptiness and
impermanence of these elements, does not cling to them. The ordinary worldling,
on the other hand, clings to the perception of earth in a piece of ice because
of its hardness. But as we know, when we heat it up to a certain degree, its
watery quality reveals itself. Further heating would bring up its fiery nature.
Continuous heating will convert it into vapour, revealing its air quality.</p>
<p>Thus these four great primaries, which the world clings to, also have the nature
of impermanence about them. The emancipated one, who rightly understands this
impermanence through his higher knowledge, does not get upset by their ghostly
configurations. His consciousness is not subject to them. This is the import of
the above paragraph.</p>
<p>The same holds true with regard to the other concepts. <em>Saṁsāric</em> beings have
their conventional usages. One might think of oneself as a god among gods. Now
Baka the Brahma had the conceit ‘I am a Brahma’. But even his Brahma-status gets
melted away like that piece of ice, at least after some aeons. So even
Brahma-hood is subject to ‘liquidation’, like an ice-cube.</p>
<p>In this way, the released consciousness of the <em>arahant</em> does not register a
perception of permanence with regard to the concepts which masquerade as real in
the worldling’s drama of existence. That is why it is called ‘non-manifestative’
consciousness. That non-manifestative consciousness is free from those concepts.</p>
<p>By way of further explanation of the nature of this released mind, we may drop a
hint through the analogy of the film and the drama, which we have employed
throughout. Now, for instance, in order to produce a tragic scene on the screen,
the film producers adopt subtle devices and camera tricks. Sometimes an
awe-inspiring scene of conflagration or ruthless arson, which drives terror into
the hearts of the audience, is produced with the help of cardboard houses.
Cardboard houses are set on fire, but the audience is hoodwinked into thinking
that a huge mansion is on fire. Similarly, terrific traffic accidents are
displayed on the screen with the help of a few toys.</p>
<p>In this drama of existence, too, there are similar tragic scenes. Now, in spite
of their tragic quality, if any member of the audience truly understands at that
moment that these are cardboard houses and toys toppled from hill tops, he sees
something comic in the apparently tragic. Likewise, in this drama of existence,
there is a tragic aspect as well as a comic aspect.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, both these words, tragic and comic, can be accommodated
within the highly significant term <em>saṁvega</em>, anguish, sense of urgency. In
trying to arouse <em>saṁvega</em> with regard to <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations, we could
bring in both these attitudes. The ordinary worldling sees only the tragic side
of the drama of existence, and that because of his ignorance. But the <em>arahant</em>,
the emancipated one, sees in this drama of existence a comic side as well.</p>
<p>As an illustration we may allude to those occasions in which the Buddha himself
and those disciples with psychic powers like Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, are said
to have shown a faint smile, <em>situppāda</em>, on seeing how beings in <em>saṁsāra</em> are
reborn in high and low realms according to their deeds, as in a puppet
show.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn266-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn266">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, that spontaneous smile has nothing sarcastic or unkind about it. But
all the same, it gives us a certain hint. This spontaneous smile seems to be the
outcome of an insight into the comic aspect of this existential drama. The faint
smile is aroused by the conviction of the utter futility and insubstantiality of
the existential drama, seeing how beings who enjoyed high positions come down to
the level of hungry ghosts, <em>petas</em>, or even to lower realms in their very next
birth. It is somewhat like the response of one who has correctly understood the
impermanence and the illusory nature of things shown on a film screen.</p>
<p>When one comes to think of this drama of existence, <em>saṁsāric</em> beings appear
like puppets drawn upwards by the five higher fetters, <em>uddhambhāgiya
saṁyojana</em>, and drawn downwards by the five lower fetters, <em>orambhāgiya
saṁyojana</em>. They reappear more or less like puppets, manipulated up and down by
strings, which are but the results of their own deeds.</p>
<p>The wherewithal for the drama of existence is supplied by the four great
primaries – the four basic elements of earth, water, fire and air. In the case
of a film or a drama, sometimes the same object can be improvised in a number of
ways, to produce various scenes and acts. What in one scene serves as a
sitting-stool, could be improvised as a footstool in another scene, and as a
table in yet another. Similarly, there is something called double-acting in
films. The same actor can delineate two characters and appear in different
guises in two scenes.</p>
<p>A similar state of affairs is to be found in this drama of existence. In fact,
the Buddha has declared that there is not a single being in <em>saṁsāra</em> who has
not been one of our relations at some time or other.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn267-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn267">6</a></sup> We are in the habit
of putting down such relations to a distant past, in order to avoid a rift in
our picture of the world by upsetting social conventions. But when one comes to
think of it in accordance with the Dhamma, and also on the strength of certain
well attested facts, sometimes the male or the female baby cuddled by a mother
could turn out to be her own dead father or mother.</p>
<p>Such a strangely ludicrous position is to be found in the acts of this drama of
existence. Usually the world is unaware of such happenings. Though ludicrous,
the world cannot afford to laugh at it. Rather, it should be regarded as a
sufficient reason for arousing an anguished sense of urgency: “What a pity that
we are subject to such a state of affairs! What a pity that we do not understand
it because of the power of influxes and latencies and thereby heap up
defilements!”</p>
<p>Such an awareness of the emptiness of all this can give rise to anguish. One can
get some understanding on the lines of the signless, the unsatisfactory, and the
void, by contemplating these facts. One can also contemplate on the four
elements, how they are at the beginning of a world period, and how they get
destroyed at the end of a world period, in the conflagration at the end of an
aeon. Likewise, when one comes to think of the state of persons or beings in
general, in accordance with this fact of relationship, there is much room for
anguish and a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>It is because of all this that the Buddha sometimes declares, as in the
discourse on the rising of seven suns, <em>Sattasuriyasutta</em>, that this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… enough to get disenchanted with all preparations, enough to get detached
from them, enough to get released from them.</p>
<p><em>alameva sabbasaṅkhāresu nibbindituṁ alaṁ virajjituṁ alaṁ vimuccituṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn268-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn268">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been drawing upon a particular nuance of the term <em>saṅkhāra</em> throughout,
that is, as things comparable to those instruments, temporarily improvised in a
dramatic performance just for the purpose of producing various acts on the
stage. It is the same with persons, who are like actors playing their parts.</p>
<p>Beings, who are born in accordance with their karma, entertain the conceit ‘I am
a god’, ‘I am a Brahma’. Once their karma is spent up, they get destroyed and
are reborn somewhere or other. It is the same with those items used in a drama,
such as the stool and the footstool. But the intriguing fact is that those in
the audience, watching each of those acts, grasp as such whatever objects they
see on the stage when they produce their individual dramas.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned at the very outset that the final stage in the
production of a drama is a matter for the audience and not for the theatricians.
Each member of the audience creates a drama in his own mind, putting together
all preparations. What serves as a stool in one act of the drama, may be used as
a footstool in the next. In the first instance it sinks into the minds of the
audience as a stool, and in the next as a footstool. It is the same in the case
of beings and their relationships.</p>
<p>It must have been due to this state of affairs in the drama of existence, which
arouses anguish, that the Buddha makes the declaration in quite a number of
discourses dealing with the topic of impermanence, including those which
describe the destruction of the aeon: “This is enough, monks, to get
disenchanted with all preparations, to get detached from them, to get released
from them”.</p>
<p>These preparations are comparable to a film reel, which is the basic requirement
for the film of name-and-form shown on the screen of consciousness of beings in
this world. As the world is regarded as a sort of stage, trees, beings and
objects in our environment are like objects on the stage. But the intriguing
fact about it is that the ordinary man in the world is unaware of their
‘prepared’ nature as a framework.</p>
<p>When one is watching a film, one becomes unaware of the fact that it is just
something shown on the screen. At that moment it appears as something real and
life-like. It is about this apparent reality that the Buddha speaks when he
utters the following lines in the <em>Itivuttaka</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jātaṁ bhūtaṁ samuppannaṁ, kataṁ saṅkhatamaddhuvaṁ;</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn269-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn269">8</a></sup></p>
<p>born, become, arisen, made up, prepared, unstable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever appears as real in this world, is actually made and prepared by
<em>saṅkhāras</em>. It is their insubstantial nature, their impermanent, unsatisfactory
and not-self nature, that is hinted at by these lines.</p>
<p>The term <em>saṅkhāra</em> is suggestive of some artificiality about this world.
Everything that goes to ‘make-it-up’ is a <em>saṅkhāra</em>. The non-manifestative
consciousness, which is aware of its impermanent nature, is therefore free from
these preparations. It is free from those concepts which the worldlings cling
to. It remains unshaken by their ghostly transfigurations.</p>
<p>We come across four wonderful verses in the <em>Adhimutta Theragāthā</em> which, though
extremely simple, give us a deep insight into this freedom in the <em>arahant’s</em>
mind.</p>
<p>The story of Venerable Adhimutta is a marvellous one.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn270-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn270">9</a></sup> While going
through a forest Venerable Adhimutta got caught to a band of robbers, who were
just getting ready to offer a human sacrifice to the gods. So they got hold of
this <em>arahant</em> as their victim. But the latter showed no consternation. There
was no fear or terror in his face. The bandit chief asked him why he is unmoved.
Then the Venerable Adhimutta uttered a set of verses in reply. Out of them, we
may quote the following four significant verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Natthi cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anapekkhassa gāmani,</em> <br />
<em>atikkantā bhayā sabbe,</em> <br />
<em>khīṇasaṁyojanassa ve.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn271-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn271">10</a></sup></p>
<p>There is no mental pain <br />
To one with no expectations, oh headman, <br />
All fears have been transcended <br />
By one whose fetters are extinct.</p>
<p><em>Na me hoti ’ahosin’ti,</em> <br />
<em>’bhavissan’ti na hoti me,</em> <br />
<em>saṅkhārā vibhavissanti,</em> <br />
<em>tattha kā paridevanā?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn272-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn272">11</a></sup></p>
<p>It does not occur to me ‘I was’, <br />
Nor does it occur to me ‘I will be’, <br />
Mere preparations get destroyed, <br />
What is there to lament?</p>
<p><em>Suddhaṁ dhammasamuppādaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>suddhaṁ saṅkhārasantatiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passantassa yathābhūtaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>na bhayaṁ hoti gāmani.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn273-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn273">12</a></sup></p>
<p>To one who sees as it is, <br />
The arising of pure <em>dhammas</em> <br />
And the sequence of pure preparations, <br />
There is no fear, oh headman.</p>
<p><em>Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yadā paññāya passati,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn274-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn274">13</a></sup></p>
<p>“When one sees with wisdom, <br />
This world as comparable to grass and twigs, <br />
Not finding anything worthwhile holding on as mine, <br />
One does not grieve: ‘O! I have nothing!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least a fraction of the gist of these four verses has already come up in some
form or other in the sermons given so far. Now as for the first verse, addressed
to the bandit chief, the first two lines say that there is no mental pain to one
who has no expectations, cravings, or desire. The next two lines state that one
whose fetters are destroyed has transcended fears.</p>
<p>To begin with, let us get at the meaning of this verse. Here it is said that
there is no mental pain, <em>natthi cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ</em>. In an earlier sermon based
on the <em>Cetanāsutta</em> we happened to mention that for one who does not take body,
word, and mind as real, there is no inward pleasure and pain, <em>ajjhattaṁ
sukhadukkhaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn275-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn275">14</a></sup> The relevant quotation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā so kāyo na hoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ
uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ … sā vācā na hoti … so mano na hoti …
khettaṁ taṁ na hoti, vatthum taṁ na hoti, āyatanaṁ taṁ na hoti, adhikaraṇaṁ
taṁ na hoti, yaṁ paccayāssa taṁ uppajjati ajjhattaṁ sukhadukkhaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn276-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn276">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance, the <em>arahant</em> has no
notion of a body. That is, he does not have a perception of a body, like that of
a worldling, who takes it as such, due to his perception of the compact,
<em>ghanasaññā</em>. Likewise that speech is not there, <em>sā vācā na hoti</em>.</p>
<p>The basic reason for speech-preparation is the reality attributed to words and
linguistic usages. When, for instance, someone scolds us, we are displeased at
it because of the reality given to those words. Similarly, that mind is not
there, <em>so mano na hoti.</em> It is only the collocation of preparations which arise
and cease that is conceived as ‘my mind’.</p>
<p>Therefore, whatever field, site, base or reason, owing to which there can arise
inward pleasure or pain, is no longer there. If the bandits had actually killed
him, he would not have had any mental pain, because he lets go before Māra comes
to grab. This is the idea expressed in the first verse.</p>
<p>As for the second verse, there too the idea of voidness is well expressed. The
thought ‘I was’, does not occur to me. The idea ‘I am’ is not in me. Nor do I
entertain the idea ‘I will be’. That is to say, it does not occur to me that I
had a past or that I will have a future. It only occurs to me that preparations
get destroyed. That was what happened in the past and will happen in the future.
So what is there to lament?</p>
<p>A very important idea emerges from these verses. Now this series of sermons is
on the subject of Nibbāna. We thought of giving these sermons because of the
existing variety of conflicting views on Nibbāna. There is no clear idea even
about our goal, not only among non-Buddhists, but even among Buddhists
themselves.</p>
<p>From these verses we can glean some important facts. Here the reference is to
existence. This <em>arahant</em> must have had numerous births as <em>pretas</em>, Brahmas,
gods, and human beings. But he is not saying something false here. What is
really meant by saying that it does not occur to me ‘I was’?</p>
<p>Ordinary worldlings, or even those with higher psychic powers, when they see
their past lives think of it as ‘I was so and so in such and such a birth’.
Sometimes one entertains a conceit at the thought ‘I was a god’, ‘I was a
Brahma’. If he had been an animal or a <em>preta</em>, he is somewhat displeased. Such
is not the case with this <em>arahant</em>. He sees that what was in the past is a mere
heap of preparations, and what will be in the future is again a heap of
preparations. It is like the case of that cinema goer who understands that
whatever comes up in the film is artificially got up. It is a state of mind
aroused by wisdom. ‘So what is there to lament’, is the attitude resulting from
it.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion, we happened to compare these preparations to a heap of
windings and unwindings in existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn277-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn277">16</a></sup> Now as to this process of winding
and unwinding, we may take as an illustration the case of a rope. There is a
winding and an unwinding in it. We can form an idea about the nature of this
existence even with the help of a simple illustration.</p>
<p>Nibbāna has been defined as the cessation of existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn278-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn278">17</a></sup> The Buddha says
that when he is preaching about the cessation of existence, some people,
particularly the <em>brahmins</em> who cling to a soul theory, bring up the charge of
nihilism against him.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn279-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn279">18</a></sup> Not only those <em>brahmins</em> and heretics believing
in a soul theory, but even some Buddhist scholars are scared of the term
<em>bhavanirodha</em>, fearing that it leads to a nihilistic interpretation of Nibbāna.
That is why they try to mystify Nibbāna in various ways. What is the secret
behind this attitude? It is simply the lack of a clear understanding of the
unique philosophy made known by the Buddha.</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Buddha, the world conceived of existence in terms of a
perdurable essence as ‘being’, <em>sat</em>. So the idea of destroying that essence of
being was regarded as annihilationism. It was some state of a soul conceived as
‘I’ and ‘mine’. But according to the law of dependent arising made known by the
Buddha, existence is something that depends on grasping, <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>.
It is due to grasping that there comes to be an existence. This is the pivotal
point in this teaching.</p>
<p>In the case of the footstool, referred to earlier, it became a footstool when it
was used as such. If in the next act it is used to sit on, it becomes a stool.
When it serves as a table, it becomes a table. Similarly in a drama, the same
piece of wood, which in one act serves as a walking stick to lean on, could be
seized as a stick to beat with, in the next act.</p>
<p>In the same way, there is no essential thing-hood in the things taken as real by
the world. They appear as things due to cravings, conceits and views. They are
conditioned by the mind, but these psychological causes are ignored by the
world, once concepts and designations are superimposed on them. Then they are
treated as real objects and made amenable to grammar and syntax, so as to
entertain such conceits and imaginings as, for instance, ‘in the chair’, ‘on the
chair’, ‘chair is mine’, and so on.</p>
<p>Such a tendency is not there in the released mind of the <em>arahant</em>. He has
understood the fact that existence is due to grasping, <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, in the explanation of the law of dependent arising, the statement
‘dependent on grasping, becoming’ is supposed to imply that one’s next life is
due to one’s grasping in this life. But this becoming is something that goes on
from moment to moment. Now, for instance, what I am now holding in my hand has
become a fan because I am using it as a fan. Even if it is made out of some
other material, it will still be called a fan. But if it were used for some
other purpose, it could become something else. This way we can understand how
existence is dependent on grasping.</p>
<p>We began our discussion with the statement that existence is a heap of windings
and unwindings. Let us now think of a simple illustration. Suppose a rope or a
cord is being made up by winding some strands from either end by two persons.
For the strands to gather the necessary tension, the two persons have to go on
winding in opposite directions. But for the sake of an illustration, let us
imagine a situation in which a third person catches hold of the strands in the
middle, just before the other two start their winding. Oddly enough, by mistake,
those two start winding in the same direction. Both are unaware of the fact that
their winding is at the same time an unwinding. The one in the middle, too, is
ignorant that it is his tight grasp in the middle which is the cause of stress
and tension.</p>
<p>To all appearance, a cord is being made up which may be taken as two cords on
either side of the one who has his hold on the middle. However, viewed from a
distance, for all practical purposes it is just one cord that is being winded
up.</p>
<p>To introduce a note of discord into this picture, let us suppose that the man in
the middle suddenly lets go of his hold with a ‘twang’. Now what happens to the
cord? The windings in the same direction from both ends, which made it a cord,
immediately get neutralized and <strong>the cord ceases to be a cord</strong>! Something like
the stilling of all preparations and the abandonment of all assets happens at
that moment. One realizes, ‘as-it-is’, that no real cord existed at all.</p>
<p>The same state of affairs prevails in this world. The impermanence of this
world, according to the Buddha, does not affect us so long as there is no
grasping on our part. All windings in this world get unwinded immediately. This
is the nature of the world. This is what is meant by <em>udayabbaya</em>, or rise and
fall.</p>
<p>Now what happens if there is no grasping in the middle while the winding is
going on in the same direction from both ends? No cord at all is made up, even
if the two at either end go on winding for aeons and aeons. Why? Simply because
they are winding in the same direction.</p>
<p>It is the same in the case of the world. The impermanence we see around us in
this world does not affect us by itself. We are affected only when we grasp. It
is the grasp in the middle that accounts for the cord, or rather, for whatever
<strong>has the semblance of a cord</strong>. In fact, this is what the worldlings call ‘the
world’. This is what they take as <strong>real</strong>. Now what is the consequence of
taking it to be real? If it is real and permanent, whatever is contrary to it,
is annihilation, the destruction of a real world.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the meaning of the Buddha’s dictum ‘dependent on grasping is
existence’, <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>, if one cares to reflect on this little
illustration, one would realize that there is actually nothing real to get
destroyed. There is no self or soul at all to get destroyed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the impermanence of the world is a process of momentary
arisings and ceasings. Given the grasping in the middle, that is to say,
‘dependent on grasping is becoming’, the other links follow suit, namely,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dependent on becoming, birth; dependent on birth, decay-and-death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair arise,</p>
<p><em>bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā
sambhavanti.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is somewhat like the unpleasant tension caused by the winding, in the person
who has a grasp at the middle. We have already referred to a short aphorism
which sums up the content of the insight of those who realize the fruits of the
path, like that of a stream-winner, namely,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ,</em></p>
<p>whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn280-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn280">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not seem to say anything significant, on the face of it. But it
succinctly expresses the plainest conviction a stream-winner gets of the
innocent process of arising and ceasing in the world. It is as if the one who
had his grasp in the middle lets go of his hold for a while, through the power
of the path moment.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of the ordinary worldling to hold on, and to hang on. That
is why the man who grasped the cord in the middle refuses to let go of his hold
in the midst of windings and unwindings, however much hardship he has to undergo
in terms of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. For him, it is
extremely difficult to let go. Until a Buddha arises in the world and proclaims
the Dhamma, the world stubbornly refuses to let go.</p>
<p>Now if one gives up the tendency to grasp, at least for a short while by
developing the noble eightfold path at its supramundane level, and lets go even
for one moment, then one understands as one grasps again that now there is less
stress and tension. Personality view, doubt and dogmatic adherence to rules and
observances, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, <em>vicikicchā, sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>, are gone. An
unwinding has occurred to some extent. The strands of the cord are less taut
now.</p>
<p>One also understands, at the moment of arising from that supramundane
experience, that one comes back to ‘existence’ because of grasping, because of
the tendency to hold on. That this tendency to hold on persists due to influxes
and latencies – due to unabandoned defilements – is also evident to him. This,
in effect, is the immediate understanding of the law of dependent arising. It
seems, then, that we have here in this simile of the cord, a clue to an
understanding of the nature of this existence.</p>
<p>Worldlings in general, whether they call themselves Buddhist or non-Buddhist,
conceive of existence in terms of a perdurable essence as ‘being’, somewhat
along the lines of the view of heretics. Nibbāna is something that drives terror
into the worldlings, so long as there is no purification of view. The cessation
of existence is much dreaded by them.</p>
<p>Even the commentators, when they get down to defining Nibbāna, give a wrong
interpretation of the word <em>dhuva</em>. They sometimes make use of the word
<em>sassata</em> in defining Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn281-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn281">20</a></sup> This is a word that should never be
brought in to explain the term Nibbāna. According to them, Nibbāna is a
permanent and eternal state. Only, you must not ask us, what precisely it is.
For, if we are more articulate, we would be betraying our proximity to such
views as <em>Brahmanirvāna</em>.</p>
<p>What is the secret behind this anomalous situation? It is the difficulty in
interpreting the term <em>dhuva</em>, which the Buddha uses as a synonym for
Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn282-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn282">21</a></sup> The true significance of this synonym has not been understood.
It means stable or immovable. Of course, we do come across this term in such
contexts as <em>niccaṁ, dhuvaṁ, sassataṁ, acavanadhammaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn283-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn283">22</a></sup> “permanent,
stable, eternal, not liable to passing away”, when Brahma gives expression to
his conceit of eternal existence. But that is because these terms are more or
less related to each other in sense.</p>
<p>Then, in which sense is Nibbāna called <em>dhuva</em>? In the sense that the experience
of Nibbāna is irreversible. That is why it is referred to as <em>acalaṁ
sukhaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn284-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn284">23</a></sup> ‘unshakeable bliss’.</p>
<p>The term <em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>, “unshakeable deliverance of the mind”, expresses
the same idea. Sometimes the Buddha refers to Nibbāna as <em>akuppā
cetovimutti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn285-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn285">24</a></sup> All other such deliverances are shakeable, or irritable.</p>
<p>As the expression <em>kuppapaṭicca santi</em>, “peace dependent on
irritability”,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn286-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn286">25</a></sup> implies, they are irritable and shakeable.</p>
<p>Even if they are unshaken during one’s life time, they get shaken up at death.
The final winning post is the pain of death. That is the critical moment at
which one can judge one’s own victory or defeat. Before the pain of death, all
other deliverances of the mind fall back defeated. But this deliverance, this
unshakeable deliverance with its ‘let go’ strategy at the approach of death,
gets never shaken. It is unshakeable. That is why it is called the bliss
unshaken, <em>acalaṁ sukhaṁ</em>. That is why it is called stable, <em>dhuvaṁ</em>. It seems,
then, that some of the terms used by the Buddha as epithets or synonyms of
Nibbāna have not been correctly understood.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Buddha employs words, used by heretics, in a different sense. In
fact, there are many such instances. Now, if one interprets such instances in
the same sense as heretics use those words, it will amount to a distortion of
the Dhamma. Here, too, we have such an instance. Unfortunately the commentators
have used the term <em>sassata</em> to define Nibbāna, taking it to be something
eternal.</p>
<p>The main reason behind this is the misconception regarding existence – that
there is an existence in truth and fact. There is this term <em>asmimāna</em>, which
implies that there is the conceit ‘am’ in this world. All other religious
teachers were concerned with the salvation of a real ‘I’. Or, in other words, to
confer immortality on this ‘I’.</p>
<p>The Buddha, on the contrary, declared that what actually ‘<strong>is</strong>’ there, is a
conceit – the conceit ‘am’. All what is necessary is the dispelling of this
conceit. That is why we sometimes come across such references to Nibbāna as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sammā mānābhisamayā antam akāsi dukkhassa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn287-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn287">26</a></sup></p>
<p>“by rightly understanding conceit, he made an end of suffering”, or:</p>
<p><em>asmimānasamugghātaṁ pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme Nibbānaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn288-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn288">27</a></sup></p>
<p>“one arrives at the eradication of the conceit ‘am’ which in itself is the
attainment of Nibbāna here and now”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some seem to think that the eradication of the conceit ‘am’ is one thing, and
Nibbāna another. But along with the eradication of the conceit ‘am’, comes
extinction. Why? Because one has been winding all this time imagining this to be
a real cord or rope. One remains ignorant of the true state of affairs, due to
one’s grasp in the middle. But the moment one lets go, one understands.</p>
<p>It is the insight into this secret that serves as the criterion in designating
the <em>ariyan</em> according to the number of births he has yet to take in <em>saṁsāra</em>.
Thus, the stream-winner is called <em>sattakkhattuparamo</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn289-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn289">28</a></sup>
‘seven-times-at-the-most’. With the sudden unwinding, which reduces the tension,
one understands the secret that the noble eightfold path is the way to
unwinding.</p>
<p>One hangs on, because one is afraid to let go. One thinks that to let go is to
get destroyed. The Buddha declares that the heaviness of one’s burden is due to
one’s grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn290-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn290">29</a></sup> What accounts for its weight is the very tenacity with
which one clings to it. This the worldlings do not understand. So they cling on
to the rope, for fear of getting destroyed.</p>
<p>But if one lets go of one’s hold, even for a moment, one would see that the
tensed strands will get relaxed at least for that moment – that there is an
immediate unwinding. Full understanding of that unwinding will come when one
‘lets-go’ completely. Then all influxes and latencies are destroyed.</p>
<p>So this little verse gives us a deep insight into the problem. What is there to
lament? Because there are no notions like ‘I was’ or ‘I am’. There is only a
destruction of preparations.</p>
<p>The term <em>vibhava</em> is used in this context in a different sense. It refers here
to the destruction of preparations. When using the two terms <em>bhava</em> and
<em>vibhava</em>, some conceive of <em>bhava</em>, or existence, as a real perdurable essence,
like a soul, and <em>vibhava</em> as its destruction. But here the word <em>vibhava</em>, in
<em>vibhavissanti</em>, refers to the destructions of preparations. There is nothing
lamentable about it. In the context of a drama, they are the paraphernalia
improvised to stage an act, like the stool and the footstool. When one comes to
think of individuals, they are no better than a multitude of puppets manipulated
by fetters of existence in accordance with karma.</p>
<p>Even in the delivering of this sermon, there is a trace of a puppet show. The
sermon is inspired by the audience. If there is no audience, there is no sermon.
We are all enacting a drama. Though for us, this particular act of the drama is
so important, there might be similar dramatic acts a few meters away from here
in the jungle. A swarm of black ants might be busily hauling away an earthworm
reeling in pain. That is one act in their own drama of life. All our activities
are like that.</p>
<p>It is our unawareness of this framework that constitutes ignorance. If at any
time one sees this framework of ignorance, free from influxes and latencies, one
gets an unobstructed vision of the world. It is as if the doors of the cinema
hall are suddenly flung open. The scene on the screen fades away completely then
and there, as we have described above.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn291-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn291">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Let us now come to the third verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suddhaṁ dhammasamuppādaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>suddhaṁ saṅkhārasantatiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passantassa yathābhūtaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>na bhayaṁ hoti gāmani.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn292-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn292">31</a></sup></p>
<p>To one who sees the arising of pure phenomena and the sequence of pure
preparations as it is, there is no fear, oh headman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse, too, has a depth of meaning, which we shall now try to elucidate.</p>
<p>Why are the phenomena qualified by the word pure, <em>suddha dhamma</em>, in this
context? Because the mind-objects, which are generally regarded as <em>dhamma</em> by
the world, are impure. Why are they impure? Because they are ‘influenced’ by
influxes. Now here we have ‘uninfluenced’ or influx-free phenomena. To the
<em>arahant’s</em> mind the objects of the world occur free of influxes. That is to
say, they do not go to build up a prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>. They are
quasi-preparations. They do not go to build up a film show.</p>
<p>If, for instance, one who is seeing a film show, has the full awareness of the
artificiality of those library-shots which go to depict a tragic scene on the
screen, without being carried away by the latency to ignorance, one will not be
able to ‘enjoy’ the film show. In fact, the film show does not exist for him.
The film show has ‘ceased’ for him.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <em>arahant</em> sees phenomena as pure phenomena. Those mind-objects
arise only to cease, that is all. They are merely a series of preparations,
<em>suddhaṁ saṅkhārasantatiṁ</em>. ‘The film reel is just being played’ – that is the
way it occurs to him. Therefore, “to one who sees all this, there is no fear, oh
headman”.</p>
<p>Let us try to give an illustration for this, too, by way of an analogy. As we
know, when a sewing machine goes into action, it sews up two folds of cloth
together. But supposing suddenly the shuttle runs out of its load of cotton.
What happens then? One might even mistake the folds to be actually sewn up,
until one discovers that they are separable. This is because the conditions for
a perfect stitch are lacking. For a perfect stitch, the shuttle has to hasten
and put a knot every time the needle goes down.</p>
<p>Now, for the <em>arahant</em>, the shuttle refuses to put in the knot. For him,
preparations, or <em>saṅkhāras</em>, are ineffective in producing a prepared, or
<em>saṅkhata</em>. He has no cravings, conceits and views. For knots of existence to
occur, there has to be an attachment in the form of craving, a loop in the form
of conceit, and a tightening in the form of views.</p>
<p>So, then, the <em>arahant’s</em> mind works like a sewing machine with the shuttle run
out of its load of cotton. Though referred to as ‘functional consciousness’, its
function is not to build up a prepared, since it is influx-free. The phenomena
merely come up to go down, just like the needle.</p>
<p>Why is ignorance given as the first link in the formula of dependent arising? It
is because the entire series is dependent on ignorance. It is not a temporal
sequence. It does not involve time. That is why the Dhamma is called timeless,
<em>akālika</em>.</p>
<p>It is the stereotype interpretation of the formula of dependent arising in terms
of three lives that has undermined the immediate and timeless quality of the
Dhamma. Since ignorance is the root cause of all other conditions, inclusive of
becoming, <em>bhava</em>, birth, <em>jāti</em>, and decay-and-death, <em>jarāmaraṇaṁ</em>, that state
of affairs immediately ceases with the cessation of ignorance. This, then, is
the reason for the last line, <em>na bhayaṁ hoti gāmani</em>, “there is no fear, oh
headman”.</p>
<p>Deathlessness, <em>amata</em>, means the absence of the fear of death. The fear that
the world has about death is something obsessional. It is like the obsessional
dread aroused by the sight of an anthill due to its association with a cobra.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this body has been compared to an anthill in the
<em>Vammikasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn293-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn293">32</a></sup> This bodily frame, made up of
the four elements, procreated by parents and built up with food and drink, is
metaphorically conceived as an anthill. The discourse says: “Take the knife, oh
wise one, and dig in.”</p>
<p>The world has the obsession that there is a real cobra of a self inside this
anthill. But once it is dug up, what does one find? One discovers an <em>arahant</em>,
who has realized selflessness, a selfless cobra, worthy of honour. Of course,
this might sound as a post-script on <em>Vammikasutta</em>, but the metaphor is so
pregnant with meaning, that it can well accommodate this interpretation, too.</p>
<p>The world has a ‘perception-of-the-compact’, <em>ghanasaññā</em>, with regard to this
body made up of the four elements. Because of that very perception or notion of
compactness, there is a fear of death.</p>
<p>There is birth, because there is existence. Now this might, on analysis, give us
an insight into the law of dependent arising. The term <em>jāti</em>, or birth,
generally calls to mind the form of a child coming out of the mother’s womb. But
in this context the Buddha uses the term in relation to <em>bhava</em>, or existence,
which in its turn is related to <em>upādāna</em>, or grasping. It is at the time we use
something as a footstool that a footstool is ‘born’. When it has ceased to serve
that purpose, the footstool is ‘dead’.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that all assets, <em>upadhi</em>, are said to be of a nature to be
born,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>jātidhammā hete, bhikkhave, upadhayo</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn294-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn294">33</a></sup></p>
<p>all these assets, monks, are of the nature to be born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only the animate objects, like wife and children, men and women slaves,
etc., but even gold and silver are mentioned there as of a nature to be born.
Now let us ponder over this statement. How can gold and silver be born? How can
they grow old? They are born because of craving, conceit and views. They come
into existence. They are born. Because of birth, they grow old. Therefore they
become objects for sorrow, lamentation and the like to arise.</p>
<p>For one who looks upon them as pure preparations, all those objects do not
crystallize into ‘things’. The description of the non-manifestative
consciousness in the <em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> looks like a riddle in the form of
a jumble of negative terms like <em>paṭhaviṁ nāhosim, paṭhaviyā nāhosiṁ, paṭhavito
nāhosiṁ</em>, (etc.), “I did not claim to be earth, I did not claim to be in earth,
I did not claim to be from earth”.</p>
<p>But what is the general idea conveyed by these expressions? The implication is
that the <em>arahant</em> looks upon all those concepts, which the worldlings make use
of to make up an existence and to assert the reality of this drama of existence,
as mere pretensions. He is convinced of their vanity and insubstantiality. As we
have already explained with the simile of the sewing machine, an existence does
not get stitched up or knitted up. The cessation of existence is experienced
then and there.</p>
<p>Some seem to think that the <em>arahant</em> experiences the <em>Nibbānic</em> bliss only
after his death. But the cessation of existence is experienced here and now,
<em>diṭṭheva dhamme</em>. This is something marvellous and unknown to any other
religious system.</p>
<p>It is just at the moment that the shuttle of the sewing machine runs out of its
load of cotton that the cessation of existence is experienced. It is then that
the latencies are uprooted and all influxes are destroyed. Cravings, conceits
and views refuse to play their part, with the result that mere preparations come
up and go down. This is the ambrosial deathless. It is said that the <em>arahants</em>
partake of ambrosial deathlessness, <em>amataṁ paribhuñjanti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn295-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn295">34</a></sup></p>
<p>What actually happened in the case of the Venerable Arahant Adhimutta was that
the bandit chief understood the Dhamma and set him free, instead of killing him,
and even got ordained under him.</p>
<p>But even if he had killed him, Venerable Adhimutta would have passed away,
experiencing the ambrosial deathless. Why? Because he can let go before Māra
comes to grab. He is, therefore, fearless. The obsessional fear of death common
to worldlings has vanished. This, then, is the ambrosia. It is not some medicine
or delicious drink for the possession of which gods and demons battle with each
other. It is that bliss of deliverance, the freedom from the fear of death.
Needless to say that it requires no seal of ever-lastingness.</p>
<p>As we once pointed out, in tune with the two lines of the following canonical verse,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>kiṁ kayirā udapānena, āpā ce sabbadā siyuṁ,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn296-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn296">35</a></sup></p>
<p>what is the use of a well, if water is there all the time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the thirst is quenched forever, why should one go in search of a well? Let
us now take up the next verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yadā paññāya passati,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn297-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn297">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now all these verses are eloquent expressions of voidness, <em>suññatā</em>. When one
sees with wisdom the entire world, that is both the internal and external world,
as comparable to grass and twigs in point of worthlessness, one does not
entertain the conceit ‘mine’ and therefore does not lament, saying: ‘Oh, I have
nothing’. One is not scared of the term <em>bhavanirodha</em>, or cessation of
existence. Why? Because all these are worthless things.</p>
<p>Here too, we may add something more by way of explanation, that is as to how
things become ‘things’ in this world – though this may seem obvious enough.
Since we have been so concerned with dramas, let us take up a dramatic situation
from the world.</p>
<p>A man is hastily walking along a jungle path. Suddenly his foot strikes against
a stone. ‘Oh, it is so painful!’ He kicks the stone with a curse. A few more
steps, and another stone trips him. This time it is even more painful. He turns
round, quietly, picks up the stone, cleans it carefully, looking around, wraps
it up in his handkerchief and slips it into his pocket. Both were stones. But
why this special treatment? The first one was a mere pebble, but the second one
turned out to be a gem!</p>
<p>The world esteems a gem stone as valuable because of craving, conceits and
views. So the first accident was a mishap, but the second – a stroke of luck.
Now, had all these mishaps and haps been filmed, it would have become something
of a comedy. Everything in our environment, even our precious possessions like
gold, silver, pearls, and gems, appear like the paraphernalia improvised for a
dramatic performance on the world stage. Once they come on the stage, from
backstage, they appear as real things. Not only do they appear as real, relative
to the acts of the drama, but they get deposited in our minds as such.</p>
<p>It is such ‘deposits’ that become our aggregates of grasping, or ‘assets’, which
we take along with us in this <em>saṁsāra</em> in the form of likes and dislikes. Loves
and hates contracted in the past largely decide our behaviour in the present
with some sort of subconscious acquiescence, so much so that we often form
attachments and revengeful aversions in accordance with them.</p>
<p>When one comes to think of it, there is something dramatic about it. When
something serves as a footstool in a particular act, it is ‘really’ a footstool.
When it is improvised to serve as some other thing in the next act, one is
unaware of the fact that it is the same object. One is not aware of the hoodwink
involved in it. Such a state of affairs prevails over the nature of
preparations, <em>saṅkhāras</em>.</p>
<p>Being ignorant of the fact that these are purely preparations, the worldlings
take concepts too seriously, to come to conclusions such as ‘I was so and so in
such and such a birth’, thereby clinging on to all the animate and inanimate
objects in the world. They are actually comparable to things temporarily
improvised to depict a particular scene in a drama or a film show.</p>
<p>That is why we compared the four elements to ghosts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn298-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn298">37</a></sup> Deluded by their
ghostly transfigurations, the worldlings create for themselves a perception of
form. The verse in question gives us an insight into this particular aspect of
the drama of existence.</p>
<p>A meditator can get at least an inkling of the emptiness and insubstantiality of this drama of existence, when he trains himself in keeping the four postures with mindfulness and full awareness. By practising it, he gets an opportunity to witness a monodrama, free of charge. And this is the drama:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When walking, he understands: ‘I am walking’; <br />
when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; <br />
when sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting’; <br />
when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn299-1"><a href="sermon-08.html#fn-fn299">38</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While keeping one’s postures in this manner, one sees in outline one’s own form
as if one were acting in a monodrama.</p>
<p>When the basis of the factors of the form group is removed, those in the name
group are reduced to purposeless activations. Earth, water, fire and air
constitute the basis of form. When a meditator becomes dispassionate with regard
to these four elements, when they begin to fade away for him, the factors in the
name group assume a ghostly character. He feels as if he is performing a drama
with non-existing objects. He opens a non-existing door, sits on a non-existing
chair, and so on.</p>
<p>Now if we try to understand this in terms of an analogy of a drama, as we have
been doing throughout, we may compare it to a mime or a dumb show. In a dumb
show, one might see such acts as follows: An actor rides a no-bike, climbs a
no-hill, meets a no-friend and has a no-chat with him. Or else he may sit on a
no-chair by a no-table and writes a no-letter with a no-pen.</p>
<p>What we mean by the no-nos here is the fact that on the stage there is neither a
bicycle, nor a hill, nor another person, nor any other object like a chair, a
table or a pen. All these are merely suggested by his acting. This kind of dumb
show has a comic effect on the audience.</p>
<p>An insight meditator, too, goes through a similar experience when he
contemplates on name-and-form, seeing the four elements as empty and void of
essence, which will give him at least an iota of the conviction that this drama
of existence is empty and insubstantial. He will realize that, as in the case of
the dumb show, he is involved with things that do not really exist. This amounts
to an understanding that the factors of the name group are dependent on the form
group, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Seeing the reciprocal relationship between name-and-form, he is disinclined to
dabble in concepts or gulp down a dose of prescriptions. If form is dependent on
name, and name is dependent on form, both are void of essence. What is essential
here, is the very understanding of essencelessness.</p>
<p>If one sits down to draw up lists of concepts and prescribe them, it would only
lead to a mental constipation. Instead of release there will be entanglement.
Such a predicament is not unlikely.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>This is the ninth sermon in the series of sermons given on the topic of Nibbāna.
In our last sermon we discussed, to some extent, how the insubstantiality and
the vanity of the comic acts enacted by <em>saṁsāric</em> beings in this drama of
existence gradually become clear to a meditator as he keeps his postures
according to the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>.</p>
<p>We mentioned how the fact that name is only a shadow of form is revealed to the
meditator when he is attending to his postures seeing the elements constituting
the basis of form as empty.</p>
<p>By way of analogy we brought in the simile of a mime or a dumb show. What
characterizes that kind of drama is the comic nature of the acts which depict
scenes suggestive of animate or inanimate objects not actually present on the
stage. A meditator becomes aware, while attending to his postures, that he is
merely enacting a dumb show. He comes to understand how far name is dependent on
form, and the four elements appear to him as empty.</p>
<p>In the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> we find the following instruction in regard to the
keeping of postures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā yathā vā pan’assa kāyo paṇihito hoti tathā tathā naṁ pajānāti,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn301-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn301">2</a></sup></p>
<p>in whatever way his body is disposed, so he understands it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is suggestive of the attempt of a spectator to understand the mimicry of an
actor or an actress in a pantomime. While attending to one’s postures one feels
as if one is watching a one-man dumb show. One gets an opportunity to watch it
even more keenly when one comes to the section on full awareness,
<em>sampajaññapabba</em>, dealing with the minor postures, <em>khuddaka iriyāpatha</em>.</p>
<p>The worldlings are in the habit of creating material objects in accordance with
the factors on the name side in an extremely subtle manner, by grasping the four
elements under the influence of the personality view, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>. The
material objects around us are recognized as such by grasping the four elements.
The definition of the form aspect in name-and-form points to such a conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cattāro ca mahābhūtā catunnañca mahābhūtānaṁ upādāya rūpaṁ,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn302-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn302">3</a></sup></p>
<p>the four great primaries and form dependent on those four primaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>upādāya</em> in this context has a special connotation of relativity. So
in this way, material objects are created with the help of factors in the name
group. This reveals a certain principle of relativity. In this relativity one
sees the emptiness of both name and form.</p>
<p>This same principle of relativity is implicit in some other statements of the
Buddha, but they are rather neglected for a lack of recognition of their
significance. We come across such a discourse with a high degree of importance
in the <em>Saḷāyatanavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. There the Buddha states that
principle of relativity with the help of an illustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hatthesu, bhikkhave, sati ādānanikkhepanaṁ paññāyati, pādesu sati
abhikkamapaṭikkamo paññāyati, pabbesu sati sammiñjanapasāraṇaṁ paññāyati,
kucchismiṁ sati jighacchā pipāsā paññāyati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn303-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn303">4</a></sup></p>
<p>When there are hands, monks, a taking up and putting down is apparent; when
there are feet, a going forward and coming back is apparent; when there are
joints, a bending and stretching is apparent; when there is a belly, hunger
and thirst is apparent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the contrary of this situation is also given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hatthesu, bhikkhave, asati ādānanikkhepanaṁ na paññāyati, pādesu asati
abhikkamapaṭikkamo na paññāyati, pabbesu asati sammiñjanapasāraṇaṁ na
paññāyati, kucchismiṁ asati jighacchā pipāsā na paññāyati.</em></p>
<p>When there are no hands, a taking up and putting down is not apparent; when
there are no feet, a going forward and coming back is not apparent; when there
are no joints, a bending and stretching is not apparent; when there is no
belly, hunger and thirst are not apparent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is implied by all this is that basic principle of relativity.</p>
<p>Some meditators, engaged in <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation, might think that
materiality does not really exist and only mentality is there. In other words,
there are no hands, only a taking up and putting down is there. There are no
feet, only a going and coming is there. That way, they might dogmatically take
the bare activity as real and subject it to an analysis.</p>
<p>But what is important here is the understanding of the relativity between the
two, which reveals the emptiness of both. If, on the other hand, one of them is
taken too seriously as real, it ends up in a dogmatic standpoint. It will not
lead to a deeper understanding of the emptiness of name and form.</p>
<p>Now in the case of a pantomime, as already mentioned, a spectator has to imagine
persons and things not found on the stage as if they are present, in order to
make sense out of an act. Here too we have a similar situation. Name and form
exist in relation to each other. What one sees through this interrelation is the
emptiness or insubstantiality of both.</p>
<p>We brought up all these analogies of dramas and film shows just to give an idea
of the impermanence of <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations. In fact, the term
<em>saṅkhāra</em>, is very apt in the context of dramas and film shows. It is
suggestive of a pretence sustained with some sort of effort. It clearly brings
out their false and unreal nature.</p>
<p>The purpose of the perception of impermanence, with regard to this drama of
existence, is the dispelling of the perception of permanence about the things
that go to make up the drama. With the dispelling of the perception of
permanence, the tendency to grasp a sign or catch a theme is removed. It is due
to the perception of permanence that one grasps a sign in accordance with
perceptual data. When one neither takes a sign nor gets carried away by its
details, there is no aspiration, expectation, or objective by way of craving.
When there is no aspiration, one cannot see any purpose or essence to aim at.</p>
<p>It is through the three deliverances, the signless, the desireless, and the
void, that the drama of existence comes to an end. The perception of
impermanence is the main contributory factor for the cessation of this drama.
Some of the discourses of the Buddha, concerning the destruction of the world,
can be cited as object lessons in the development of the perception of
impermanence leading to the signless deliverance.</p>
<p>For instance, in the discourse on the appearance of the seven suns,
<em>Sattasuriyasutta</em>, mentioned earlier,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn304-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn304">5</a></sup> this world system, which is so
full of valuable things like the seven kinds of jewels, gets fully consumed in a
holocaust leaving not even a trace of ash or soot, as if some ghee or oil has
been burned up. The perception of impermanence, arising out of this description,
automatically leads to an understanding of voidness.</p>
<p>If the conviction that not only the various actors and actresses on the world
stage, but all the accompanying decorations get fully destroyed together with
the stage itself at some point of time grips the mind with sufficient intensity
to exhaust the influxes of sensuality, existence and ignorance, emancipation
will occur then and there. That may be the reason why some attained
<em>arahanthood</em> immediately on listening to that sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn305-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn305">6</a></sup> That way, the
perception of impermanence acts as an extremely powerful antidote for
defilements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā sabbaṁ kāmarāgaṁ pariyādiyati,
sabbaṁ rūparāgaṁ pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ bhavarāgaṁ pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ avijjaṁ
pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ asmimānaṁ pariyādiyati samūhanati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn306-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn306">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, the perception of impermanence, when developed and intensively
practised, exhausts all attachments to sensuality, exhausts all attachments to
form, exhausts all attachments to existence, exhausts all ignorance, exhausts
all conceits of an ‘am’ and eradicates it completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the perception of impermanence gradually leads to an
understanding of voidness, as is clearly stated in the following quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccasaññino, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno anattasaññā sanṭhāti. Anattasaññī
asmimānasamugghātaṁ pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme nibbānaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn307-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn307">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, in one who has the perception of impermanence, the perception of
not-self gets established. With the perception of not-self, he arrives at the
destruction of the conceit ‘am’, which is extinction here and now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an assessment of the importance of the perception of impermanence will
enable us to make sense out of the seemingly contradictory statements in some of
the verses in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, such as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puttā matthi dhanaṁ matthi,</em> <br />
<em>iti bālo vihaññati,</em> <br />
<em>attā hi attano natthi,</em> <br />
<em>kuto puttā kuto dhanaṁ?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn308-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn308">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Sons I have, wealth I have, <br />
So the fool is vexed, <br />
Even oneself is not one’s self, <br />
Where then are sons, where is wealth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The perception of not-self at its highest, gives rise to the idea of voidness,
as implied by the dictum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>suññam idaṁ attena vā attaniyena vā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn309-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn309">10</a></sup></p>
<p>this is empty of self or anything belonging to a self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some are afraid of this term <em>suññatā</em>, emptiness, voidness, for various
reasons. That is why we mentioned at the very outset, already in the first
sermon, that gradually the monks themselves showed a lack of interest in those
discourses that deal with the idea of voidness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn310-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn310">11</a></sup> The Buddha had already
predicted, as a danger that will befall the <em>Sāsana</em> in the future, this lack of
regard for such discourses. This prediction reveals the high degree of
importance attached to them.</p>
<p>The last two sections of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, namely <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> and
<em>Pārāyanavagga</em>, abound in extremely deep sermons. In the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em>, for
instance, we find the Brahmin youth Mogharāja putting the following question
to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁ lokaṁ avekkhantaṁ, maccurājā na passati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn311-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn311">12</a></sup></p>
<p>By looking upon the world in which manner can one escape the eye of the king
of death?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha gives the answer in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suññato lokaṁ avekkhassu,</em> <br />
<em>Mogharāja sadā sato,</em> <br />
<em>attānudiṭṭhim ūhacca,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ maccutaro siyā,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ lokam avekkhantaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>maccurājā na passati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn312-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn312">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Look upon the world as void, <br />
Mogharāja, being mindful at all times, <br />
Uprooting the lingering view of self, <br />
Get well beyond the range of death, <br />
Him who thus looks upon the world, <br />
The king of death gets no chance to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we can infer that the entire Dhamma, even like the world system
itself, inclines towards voidness. This fact is borne out by the following
significant quotation in the <em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em>, cited by Sakka as an
aphorism given by the Buddha himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sabbe dhammā nālaṁ abhinivesāya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn313-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn313">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we may render it simply as “nothing is worth clinging on to”, it has a
deeper significance. The word <em>abhinivesa</em> is closely associated with the idea
of entering into or getting entangled in views of one’s own creation. The
implication, then, is that not only the views as such, but nothing at all is
worthwhile getting entangled in. This is suggestive of the emptiness of
everything.</p>
<p>This brings us to a very important sutta among the Eighths of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>, namely the <em>Kiṁmūlakasutta</em>. In this particular sutta we find the
Buddha asking the monks how they would answer a set of questions which wandering
ascetics of other sects might put to them. The questions are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁ mūlakā, āvuso, sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kiṁ sambhavā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kiṁ samudayā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kiṁ samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kiṁ pamukhā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kim adhipateyyā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kim uttarā sabbe dhammā?</em> <br />
<em>Kiṁ sārā sabbe dhammā?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn314-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn314">15</a></sup></p>
<p>What is the root of all things? <br />
What is the origin of all things? <br />
Where do all things arise? <br />
Towards what do all things converge? <br />
What is at the head of all things? <br />
What dominates all things? <br />
What is the point of transcendence of all things? <br />
What is the essence of all things?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monks confessed that they are unable to answer those questions on their own and begged the Buddha to instruct them. Then the Buddha gave the exact answer to each question in a cut and dried form, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the way you should answer if wandering ascetics of other sects raise those questions:</p>
<p><em>Chandamūlakā, āvuso, sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>manasikārasambhavā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>phassasamudayā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>vedanāsamosaraṇā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>samādhipamukhā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>satādhipateyyā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>paññuttarā sabbe dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>vimuttisārā sabbe dhammā</em>.</p>
<p>Rooted in desire, friends, are all things. <br />
Born of attention are all things. <br />
Arisen from contact are all things. <br />
Converging on feeling are all things. <br />
Headed by concentration are all things. <br />
Dominated by mindfulness are all things. <br />
Surmountable by wisdom are all things. <br />
Yielding deliverance as essence are all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before getting down to an analysis of the basic meaning of this discourse, it is
worthwhile considering why the Buddha forestalled a possible perplexity among
his disciples in the face of a barrage of questions likely to be levelled by
other sectarians. Why did he think it fit to prepare the minds of the disciples
well in advance of such a situation?</p>
<p>Contemporary ascetics of other sects, notably the <em>brahmins</em>, entertained
various views regarding the origin and purpose of ‘all things’. Those who
subscribed to a soul theory, had different answers to questions concerning
thing-hood or the essence of a thing. Presumably it was not easy for the monks,
with their not-self standpoint, to answer those questions to the satisfaction of
other sectarians. That is why those monks confessed their incompetence and
begged for guidance.</p>
<p>It was easy for those of other sects to explain away the questions relating to
the origin and purpose of things on the basis of their soul theory or divine
creation. Everything came out of Brahma, and self is the essence of everything.
No doubt, such answers were substantial enough to gain acceptance. Even modern
philosophers are confronted with the intricate problem of determining the exact
criterion of a ‘thing’. What precisely accounts for the thing-hood of a thing?
What makes it no-thing?</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the sutta, its traditional commentators seem to have ignored
the deeper philosophical dimensions of the above questionnaire. They have
narrowed down the meaning of the set of answers recommended by the Buddha by
limiting its application to wholesome mental states.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn315-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn315">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The occurrence of such terms as <em>chanda, sati, samādhi</em> and <em>paññā</em>, had
probably led them to believe that the entire questionnaire is on the subject of
wholesome mental states. But this is a serious underestimation of the import of
the entire discourse. It actually goes far deeper in laying bare a basic
principle governing both skilful and unskilful mental states.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, the first two verses of the <em>Dhammapada</em> bring out a
fundamental law of psychology applicable to things both skilful and unskilful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn316-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn316">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both verses draw upon this fundamental principle. Nowadays, these two lines are
variously interpreted, but the basic idea expressed is that “all things have
mind as their forerunner, mind is their chief, and they are mind-made”. This
applies to both skilful and unskilful mental states.</p>
<p>Now the sutta in question has also to be interpreted in the same light, taking
into account both these aspects. It must be mentioned, in particular, that with
the passage of time a certain line of interpretation gained currency, according
to which such terms as <em>chanda</em> were taken as skilful in an exclusive sense.</p>
<p>For instance, the term <em>sati</em>, wherever and whenever it occurred, was taken to
refer to <em>sammā sati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn317-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn317">18</a></sup> Likewise, <em>chanda</em> came to be interpreted as
<em>kusalacchanda</em>, desire or interest in the skilful, or <em>kattukamyatāchanda</em>,
desire to perform.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn318-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn318">19</a></sup></p>
<p>But we have to reckon with a special trait in the Buddha’s way of preaching. His
sermons were designed to lead onward the listeners, gradually, according to
their degree of understanding. Sometimes the meaning of a term, as it occurs at
the end of a sermon, is different from the meaning it is supposed to have at the
beginning of the sermon. Such a technique is also evident.</p>
<p>The term <em>chanda</em> is one that has both good and bad connotations. In such
contexts as <em>chandarāga</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn319-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn319">20</a></sup> and <em>chandajaṁ aghaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn320-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn320">21</a></sup> it is suggestive
of craving as the cause of all suffering in this world. It refers to that
attachment, <em>rāga</em>, which the world identifies with craving as such.</p>
<p>But in the context <em>chanda-iddhipāda</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn321-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn321">22</a></sup> where the reference is to a
particular base for success, it is reckoned as a skilful mental state. However,
that is not a sufficient reason to regard it as something alien to the generic
sense of the term.</p>
<p>There is an important sutta, which clearly reveals this fact, in the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>. A <em>brahmin</em> named Uṇṇābha once came to Venerable Ānanda with a question
that has a relevance to the significance of the term <em>chanda</em>. His question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kim atthiyaṁ nu kho, bho Ānanda, samaṇe Gotame brahmacariyaṁ vussati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn322-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn322">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Sir Ānanda, what is the purpose for which the holy life is lived under the
recluse Gotama?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda promptly gives the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chandappahānatthaṁ kho, brāhmaṇa, bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati.</em></p>
<p>Brahmin, it is for the abandonment of desire that the holy life is lived under
the Exalted One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the <em>brahmin</em> asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi pana, bho Ānanda, maggo atthi paṭipadā etassa chandassa pahānāya?</em></p>
<p>Is there, sir Ānanda, a way or practice for the abandonment of this desire?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda says: “Yes”. Now, what is the way he mentions in that context?
It is none other than the four bases for success, <em>iddhipāda</em>, which are
described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chandasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṁ iddhipādaṁ bhāveti,</em> <br />
<em>viriyasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṁ iddhipādaṁ bhāveti,</em> <br />
<em>cittasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṁ iddhipādaṁ bhāveti,</em> <br />
<em>vīmaṁsāsamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṁ iddhipādaṁ bhāveti</em>.</p>
<p>(1.) “One develops the basis for success that has volitional preparations
leading to a concentration through desire”,</p>
<p>(2.) “one develops the basis for success that has volitional preparations
leading to a concentration through energy”,</p>
<p>(3.) “one develops the basis for success that has volitional preparations
leading to a concentration by making up the mind”,</p>
<p>(4.) “one develops the basis for success that has volitional preparations
leading to a concentration through investigation”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda replies that the way of practice to be followed for the
abandonment of desire is the above mentioned four bases pertaining to desire,
energy, mind and investigation. The <em>brahmin</em> is puzzled at this reply. He
thinks, if that is so, desire is not abandoned. It is still there. And he raises
this objection to show that there is an implicit contradiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chandeneva chandaṁ pajahissatī’ti, netaṁ ṭhānaṁ vijjati</em>,</p>
<p>that one abandons desire by desire itself is an impossibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Venerable Ānanda brings out a simile to convince the <em>brahmin</em> of the
implicit truth in his reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think, <em>brahmin</em>, is it not the case that you earlier had the
desire ‘I will go to the park’, and after you came here, the appropriate
desire subsided?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is the logic behind the statement concerning the abandonment of craving.
The term <em>chanda</em> is used here in the first instance with reference to that type
of craving for the purpose of the abandonment of craving.</p>
<p>Desire as a basis for success is developed for the very abandonment of desire.
So there is no question about the use of the same word. Here, <em>chanda</em> as a base
of success still belongs to the <em>chanda</em>-family. A desire should be there even
for the abandonment of desire. This is a distinctive basic principle underlying
the middle path.</p>
<p>Some have a great liking for the word <em>chanda</em>, but dislike the word <em>taṇhā</em>. So
much so that, if one speaks of a craving for attaining Nibbāna, it might even be
regarded as a blasphemy. In another sermon given by Venerable Ānanda himself,
one addressed to a particular sick nun, we find the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṇhaṁ nissāya taṇhā pahātabbā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn323-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn323">24</a></sup></p>
<p>depending on craving one should abandon craving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That again is suggestive of a special application of the middle path technique.
But the kind of craving meant here is not something crude. It is specifically
explained there that it is the longing arising in one for the attainment of
<em>arahanthood</em> on hearing that someone has already attained it. Of course, there
is a subtle trace of craving even in that longing, but it is one that is helpful
for the abandonment of craving. So one need not fight shy of the implications of
these words.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, even the word <em>rati</em>, attachment, is used with reference to
Nibbāna. When, for instance, it is said that the disciple of the Buddha is
attached to the destruction of craving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>taṇhakkhayarato hoti sammāsambuddhasāvako,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn324-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn324">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may sound rather odd, because the word <em>rati</em> usually stands for lust.
However, according to the Middle Path principle of utilizing one thing to
eliminate another, words like <em>chanda</em> and <em>taṇhā</em> are used with discretion.</p>
<p>Sometimes terms like <em>nekkhamasita domanassa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn325-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn325">26</a></sup> unhappiness based on
renunciation, are employed to indicate the desire for attaining Nibbāna.
Therefore the statement <em>chandamūlakā sabbe dhammā</em> need not be interpreted as
referring exclusively to skilful mental states.</p>
<p>With regard to the significance of <em>sati</em> and <em>samādhi</em>, too, we may mention in
passing, that terms like <em>micchā sati</em>, wrong mindfulness, and <em>micchā samādhi</em>,
wrong concentration, do sometimes occur in the discourses.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn326-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn326">27</a></sup></p>
<p>So let us
examine whether the set of statements under consideration has any sequential
coherence or depth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rooted in desire, friends, are all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might as well bring out the meaning of these statements with the help of an
illustration. Supposing there is a heap of rubbish and someone approaches it
with a basket to collect it and throw it away. Now, about the rubbish heap, he
has just a unitary notion. That is to say, he takes it as just one heap of
rubbish. But as he bends down and starts collecting it into the basket, he
suddenly catches sight of a gem. Now the gem becomes the object of his desire
and interest.</p>
<p>A gem arose out of what earlier appeared as a rubbish heap. It became the thing
for him, and desire was at the root of this phenomenon – true to the dictum
“rooted in desire, friends, are all things”.</p>
<p>Then what about origination through attention? It is through attention that the
gem came into being. One might think that the origin of the gem should be traced
to the mine or to some place where it took shape, but the Buddha traces its
origin in accordance with the norm <em>manopubbaṅgamā dhammā</em>, “mind is the
forerunner of all things”. So then, the root is desire and the source of origin
is attention, the very fact of attending.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Phassasamudayā sabbe dhammā,</em></p>
<p>all things arise from contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was eye-contact with the gem as something special out of all the things in
the rubbish heap. So the gem ‘arose’ from eye-contact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vedanāsamosaraṇā sabbe dhammā,</em></p>
<p>all things converge on feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as the eye spotted the gem, a lot of pleasant feelings about it arose in
the mind. Therefore, all things converge on feeling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Samādhipamukhā sabbe dhammā,</em></p>
<p>headed by concentration are all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in this case, it may be wrong concentration, <em>micchā samādhi</em>, but all the
same it is some kind of concentration. It is now a concentration on the gem. It
is as if his meditation has shifted from the rubbish heap to the gem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Satādhipateyyā sabbe dhammā,</em></p>
<p>dominated by mindfulness are all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to this dominance, undistracted attention is necessary for the maintenance of
that thing which has now been singled out. Where there is distraction, attention
is drawn to other things as well. That is why mindfulness is said to be
dominant. Be it the so-called wrong mindfulness, but nonetheless, it is now
directed towards the gem.</p>
<p>Now comes the decisive stage, that is, the ‘surmountability by wisdom’, <em>paññuttarā</em>.</p>
<p>Let us for a moment grant that somehow or other, even though wrongly, <em>micchā</em>,
some kind of surrogate mindfulness and concentration has developed out of this
situation. Now, if one wants to cross over in accordance with the Dhamma, that
is, if one wants to attain Nibbāna with this gem itself as the topic of
meditation, one has to follow the hint given by the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>paññuttarā sabbe dhammā</em>,</p>
<p>surmountable by wisdom are all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What one has to do now is to see through the gem, to penetrate it, by viewing it
as impermanent, fraught with suffering, and not-self, thereby arriving at the
conviction that, after all, the gem belongs to the rubbish heap itself.</p>
<p>The gem is transcended by the wisdom that it is just one item in this rubbish
heap that is ‘the world’ in its entirety. If one wins to the wisdom that this
gem is something like a piece of charcoal, to be destroyed in the holocaust at
the end of a world period, one has transcended that gem.</p>
<p>So then, the essence of all things is not any self or soul, as postulated by the
<em>brahmins</em>. Deliverance is the essence. In such discourses as the
<em>Mahāsāropamasutta</em>, the essence of this entire Dhamma is said to be
deliverance.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn327-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn327">28</a></sup> The very emancipation from all this, to be rid of all this,
is itself the essence.</p>
<p>Some seem to think that the essence is a heaping up of concepts and clinging to
them. But that is not the essence of this teaching. It is the ability to
penetrate all concepts, thereby transcending them. The deliverance resulting
from transcendence is itself the essence.</p>
<p>With the cessation of that concept of a gem as some special thing, a valuable
thing, separate from the rest of the world, as well as of the ensuing heap of
concepts by way of craving, conceit and views, the gem ceases to exist. That
itself is the deliverance. It is the emancipation from the gem. Therefore,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>vimuttisārā sabbe dhammā,</em></p>
<p>deliverance is the essence of all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then, we have here a very valuable discourse which can even be used as a
topic of insight meditation. The essence of any mind object is the very
emancipation from it, by seeing it with wisdom. Considered in this light,
everything in the world is a meditation object. That is why we find very strange
meditation topics mentioned in connection with the attainments of ancient
<em>arahant</em> monks and nuns. Sometimes, even apparently unsuitable meditation
objects have been successfully employed.</p>
<p>Meditation teachers, as a rule, do not approve of certain meditation objects for
beginners, with good reasons. For instance, they would not recommend a female
form as a meditation object for a male, and a male form for a female. That is
because it can arouse lust, since it is mentioned in the <em>Theragāthā</em> that lust
arose in some monk even on seeing a decayed female corpse in a cemetery.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn328-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn328">29</a></sup>
But in the same text one comes across an episode in connection with Venerable
Nāgasamāla, which stands in utter contrast to it.</p>
<p>Venerable Nāgasamāla attained <em>arahanthood</em> with the help of a potentially
pernicious meditation object, as he describes it, in his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, on my begging round, I happened to look up to see a dancing woman,
beautifully dressed and bedecked, dancing to the rhythm of an orchestra just
on the middle of the highway.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn329-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn329">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, what happened then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tato me manasikāro,</em> <br />
<em>yoniso udapajjatha,</em> <br />
<em>ādīnavo pāturahu,</em> <br />
<em>nibbidā samatiṭṭhatha,</em> <br />
<em>tato cittaṁ vimucci me,</em> <br />
<em>passa dhammasudhammataṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn330-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn330">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Just then, radical attention <br />
Arose from within me, <br />
The perils were manifest, <br />
And dejection took place, <br />
Then my mind got released, <br />
Behold the goodness of the Norm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one wishes to discover the goodness of this norm, one has to interpret the
sutta in question in a broader perspective, without limiting its application to
skilful mental states.</p>
<p>If a train of thoughts had got started up about that gem, even through a wrong
concentration, and thereby a wrong mindfulness and a wrong concentration had
taken shape, at whatever moment radical attention comes on the scene, complete
reorientation occurs instantaneously, true to those qualities of the Dhamma
implied by the terms, <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, visible here and now, <em>akālika</em>, not
involving time, and <em>ehipassika</em>, inviting one to come and see.</p>
<p>Some might wonder, for instance, how those <em>brahmins</em> of old who had practiced
their own methods of concentration, attained <em>arahanthood</em> on hearing just one
stanza as soon as they came to the Buddha.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn331-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn331">32</a></sup> The usual interpretation is
that it is due to the miraculous powers of the Buddha, or else that the persons
concerned had an extraordinary stock of merit. The miracle of the Dhamma,
implicit in such occurrences, is often ignored.</p>
<p>Now as to this miracle of the Dhamma, we may take the case of someone keen on
seeing a rainbow. He will have to go on looking at the sky indefinitely, waiting
for a rainbow to appear. But if he is wise enough, he can see the spectrum of
rainbow colours through a dewdrop hanging on a leaf of a creeper waving in the
morning sun, provided he finds the correct perspective. For him, the dewdrop
itself is the meditation object. In the same way, one can sometimes see the
entire Dhamma, thirty-seven factors of enlightenment and the like, even in a
potentially pernicious meditation object.</p>
<p>From an academic point of view, the two terms <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, radical
attention, and <em>ayoniso manasikāra</em>, non-radical attention, are in utter
contrast to each other. There is a world of difference between them. So also
between the terms <em>sammā diṭṭhi</em>, right view, and <em>micchā diṭṭhi</em>, wrong view.
But from the point of view of realization, there is just a little difference.</p>
<p>Now as we know, that spectrum of the sun’s rays in the dewdrop disappears with a
very little shift in one’s perspective. It appears only when viewed in a
particular perspective. What we find in this Dhamma is something similar. This
is the intrinsic nature of this Dhamma that is to be seen here and now,
timeless, leading onward, and realizable by the wise each one by himself.</p>
<p>Our interpretation of this sutta, taking the word <em>sabbe dhammā</em> to mean ‘all
things’, is further substantiated by the <em>Samiddhisutta</em> found in the section on
the Nines in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>. It is a discourse preached by Venerable
Sāriputta.</p>
<p>To a great extent, it runs parallel to the one we have already analysed. The
difference lies only in a few details. In that sutta we find Venerable Samiddhi
answering the questions put to him by Venerable Sāriputta, like a pupil at a
catechism. The following is the gist of questions raised and answers given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Kim ārammaṇā, Samiddhi, purisassa saṅkappavitakkā uppajjantī’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Nāmarūpārammaṇā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kva nānattaṁ gacchantī’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Dhātūsu, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kiṁ samudayā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Phassasamudayā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kiṁ samosaraṇā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Vedanāsamosaraṇā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kiṁ pamukhā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Samādhipamukhā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kim adhipateyyā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Satādhipateyyā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kim uttarā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Paññuttarā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi kiṁ sārā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Vimuttisārā, bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Te pana, Samiddhi, kim ogadhā’ti?</em> <br />
<em>‘Amatogadhā, bhante.’</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn332-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn332">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for the first two questions and the last one, the rest is the same as in
the questionnaire given by the Buddha. But from this catechism it is extremely
clear that Venerable Sāriputta is asking about thoughts and concepts.</p>
<p>In the case of the previous sutta, one could sometimes doubt whether the word
<em>sabbe dhammā</em> referred to skilful or unskilful mental states. But here it is
clear enough that Venerable Sāriputta’s questions are on thoughts and concepts.
Let us now try to translate the above catechism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With what as object, Samiddhi, do concepts and thoughts arise in a man?” <br />
“With name-and-form as object, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But where, Samiddhi, do they assume diversity?” <br />
“In the elements, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But from what, Samiddhi, do they arise?” <br />
“They arise from contact, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But on what, Samiddhi, do they converge?” <br />
“They converge on feeling, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But what, Samiddhi, is at their head?” <br />
“They are headed by concentration, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But by what, Samiddhi, are they dominated?” <br />
“They are dominated by mindfulness, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But what, Samiddhi, is their highest point?” <br />
“Wisdom is their highest point, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But what, Samiddhi, is their essence?” <br />
“Deliverance is their essence, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“But in what, Samiddhi, do they get merged?” <br />
“They get merged in the deathless, venerable sir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some noteworthy points emerge from this catechism. All concepts and thoughts
have name-and-form as their object. The eighteen elements account for their
diversity. They arise with contact. They converge on feeling. They are headed by
concentration. They are dominated by mindfulness. Their acme or point of
transcendence is wisdom. Their essence is deliverance and they get merged in the
deathless.</p>
<p>Be it noted that the deathless is a term for Nibbāna. Therefore, as we have
stated above, everything has the potentiality to yield the deathless, provided
radical attention is ushered in.</p>
<p>It is indubitably clear, from this catechism, that the subject under
consideration is concepts and thoughts. All mind objects partake of the
character of concepts and thoughts. Therefore the mind objects, according to the
Buddha, have to be evaluated on the lines of the above mentioned normative
principles, and not on the lines of self essence and divine creation as
postulated by soul theories.</p>
<p>In accordance with the dictum ‘mind is the forerunner of all things’,
<em>manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn333-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn333">34</a></sup> the course of training advocated by the Buddha,
which begins with name-and-form as object, reaches its consummation in seeing
through name-and-form, that is, in its penetration. It culminates in the
transcendence of name-and-form, by penetrating into its impermanent,
suffering-fraught, and not-self nature. This fact is borne out by the discourses
already quoted.</p>
<p>The essence of the teaching is release from name-and-form. When one rightly
understands the relation between name and form as well as their emptiness, one
is able to see through name-and-form. This penetration is the function of
wisdom. So long as wisdom is lacking, consciousness has a tendency to get
entangled in name-and-form.</p>
<p>This is the insinuation of the following <em>Dhammapada</em> verse about the <em>arahant</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kodhaṁ jahe vippajaheyya mānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁyojanaṁ sabbam atikkameyya,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ nāmarūpasmim asajjamānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>akiñcanaṁ nānupatanti dukkhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn334-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn334">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Let one put wrath away, conceit abandon, <br />
And get well beyond all fetters as well, <br />
That one, untrammelled by name-and-form, <br />
With naught as his own – no pains befall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The path shown by the Buddha, then, is one that leads to the transcendence of
name-and-form by understanding its emptiness. In this connection, the
<em>Brahmajālasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> reveals a very important fact on
analysis.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn335-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn335">36</a></sup> What it portrays is how the sixty-two wrong views lose their
lustre in the light of wisdom emanating from the non-manifestative consciousness
of the Buddha, which is lustrous on all sides, <em>sabbato pabha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn336-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn336">37</a></sup></p>
<p>As to how a lustre could be superseded, we have already explained with reference
to a film show.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn337-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn337">38</a></sup> The film show lost its lustre when the doors were flung
open. The narrow beam of light, directed on the cinema screen, faded away
completely before the greater light now coming from outside. Similarly, the
sixty-two wrong views in the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em> are seen to fade away before the
light of wisdom coming from the non-manifestative consciousness of the Buddha.
The narrow beams of sixty-two wrong views faded in the broader flood of light
that is wisdom.</p>
<p>Those heretics who propounded those wrong views, conceived them by dogmatically
holding on to name-and-form. They got entangled in name-and-form, and those
views were the product of speculative logic based on it. We come across an
allusion to this fact in the <em>Mahāviyūhasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. There it
is declared that those of other sects are not free from the limitations of
name-and-form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Passaṁ naro dakkhati nāmarūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>disvāna vā ñassati tānim eva,</em> <br />
<em>kāmaṁ bahuṁ passatu appakaṁ vā,</em> <br />
<em>na hi tena suddhiṁ kusalā vadanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn338-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn338">39</a></sup></p>
<p>A seeing man will see only name-and-form, <br />
Having seen he will know just those constituents alone, <br />
Let him see much or little, <br />
Experts do not concede purity thereby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em> itself we find some views advanced by those who had
higher knowledges. With the help of those higher knowledges, which were still of
the mundane type, they would see into their past, sometimes hundreds of
thousands of their past lives, and drawing also from their ability to read
others’ minds, they would construct various views. Many such views are recorded
in the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em>, only to be rejected and invalidated. Why so? The
reason is given here in this verse.</p>
<p>The man who claims to see with those higher knowledges is seeing only
name-and-form, <em>passaṁ naro dakkhiti nāmarūpaṁ</em>. Having seen, he takes whatever
he sees as real knowledge, <em>disvāna vā ñassati tānim eva</em>.</p>
<p>Just as someone inside a closed room with tinted window panes sees only what is
reflected on those dark panes, and not beyond, even so, those ‘seers’ got
enmeshed in name-and-form when they proceeded to speculate on what they saw as
their past lives. They took name-and-form itself to be real. That is why the
Buddha declared that whether they saw much or little, it is of no use, since
experts do not attribute purity to that kind of vision, <em>kāmaṁ bahuṁ passatu
appakaṁ vā, na hi tena suddhiṁ kusalā vadanti</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is clear enough that those narrow wrong views are based on
name-and-form, assuming it to be something real. The Buddha’s vision, on the
other hand, is one that transcends name-and-form. It is a supramundane vision.
This fact is clearly revealed by the implications of the very title of the
<em>Brahmajālasutta</em>. At the end of the discourse, the Buddha himself compares it
to an all-embracing super-net.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn339-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn339">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as a clever fisherman would throw a finely woven net well over a small
lake, so that all the creatures living there are caught in it as they come up,
all the possible views in the world are enmeshed or forestalled by this
super-net, or <em>brahmajāla</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now pause to consider what the mesh of this net could be. If the
<em>Brahmajālasutta</em> is a net, what constitutes that fine mesh in this net? There
is a word occurring all over the discourse, which gives us a clear answer to
this question. It is found in the phrase which the Buddha uses to disqualify
every one of those views, namely,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tadapi phassapaccayā, tadapi phassapaccayā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn340-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn340">41</a></sup></p>
<p>and that too is due to contact, and that too is due to contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from this we can see that contact is the mesh of this net.</p>
<p>The medley of wrong views, current among those of other sects, is the product of
the six sense-bases dependent on contact. The Buddha’s vision, on the other
hand, seems to be an all-encompassing lustre of wisdom, born of the cessation of
the six sense-bases, which in effect, is the vision of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>This fact is further clarified in the sutta by the statement of the Buddha that
those who cling to those wrong views, based on name-and-form, keep on whirling
within the <em>saṁsāric</em> round because of those very views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sabbe te chahi phassāyatanehi phussa phussa paṭisaṁvedenti, tesaṁ
phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ,
upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā sambhavanti. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu,
channaṁ phassāyatanānaṁ samudayañca atthagamañca assādañca ādīnavañca
nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, ayaṁ imehi sabbeheva uttaritaraṁ
pajānāti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn341-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn341">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They all continue to experience feeling coming into contact again and again
with the six sense-bases, and to them dependent on contact there is feeling,
dependent on feeling there is craving, dependent on craving there is grasping,
dependent on grasping there is becoming, dependent on becoming there is birth,
and dependent on birth, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
despair come to be. But when, monks, a monk knows, as they truly are, the
arising, the going down, the satisfaction, the peril and the stepping out
concerning the six sense-bases, that monk has a knowledge which is far
superior to that of all those dogmatists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph clearly brings out the distinction between those who held on to
such speculative views and the one who wins to the vision made known by the
Buddha. The former were dependent on contact, that is, sensory contact, even if
they possessed worldly higher knowledges. Because of contact originating from
the six sense-bases there is feeling. Because of feeling they are lured into
craving and grasping which make them go round and round in <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>The emancipated monk who keeps to the right path, on the other hand, wins to
that synoptic vision of the six sense-bases, replete in its five aspects. That
is what is known as the light of wisdom. To him, all five aspects of the six
sense-bases become clear, namely the arising, the going down, the satisfaction,
the peril and the stepping out. That light of wisdom is considered the highest
knowledge, precisely because it reveals all these five aspects of the six
sense-bases.</p>
<p>The reference to the formula of dependent arising in the above passage is highly
significant. It is clear proof of the fact that the law of dependent arising is
not something to be explained with reference to a past existence. It is a law
relevant to the present moment.</p>
<p>This name-and-form is reflected on consciousness. Now as to this consciousness,
the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, which is a section dealing with
the law of dependent arising in particular, defines it in a way that includes
all the six types of consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamañca, bhikkhave, viññāṇaṁ? Chayime, bhikkhave, viññāṇakāyā –
cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, sotaviññāṇaṁ, ghānaviññāṇaṁ, jivhāviññāṇaṁ, kāyaviññāṇaṁ,
manoviññāṇaṁ, idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, viññāṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn342-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn342">43</a></sup></p>
<p>And what, monks, is consciousness? There are these six classes of
consciousness – eye- consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness,
tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness; this, monks,
is called consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the consciousness mentioned in the formula of dependent arising
is not something like a re-linking consciousness. The reference here is not to
just one consciousness. It is in dependence on name-and-form, reflected on all
six types of consciousness, that the six sense-bases get established.</p>
<p>The discrimination between an ‘internal’ and an ‘external’ is the outcome of the
inability to penetrate name-and-form, to see through it. There is an apparent
duality: I, as one who sees, and name-and-form, as the objects seen. Between
them there is a dichotomy as internal and external. It is on this very dichotomy
that the six sense-bases are ‘based’. Feeling and all the rest of it come on top
of those six sense-bases. Craving and grasping follow suit, as a result of which
those dogmatists get caught up in the vicious cycle of dependent arising and
keep running round in <em>saṁsāra</em> as the Buddha has declared.</p>
<p>So then, it becomes clear from the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em> that such a wide variety of
wrong views exist in this world due to the dogmatic involvement in name-and-form
reflected on consciousness, that is by mis-taking the reflection to be one’s
self. This, in brief, is tantamount to <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, or personality view.</p>
<p>Now let us take up a parable by way of an illustration of the distinction
between the wrong view of the dogmatists, already analysed, and the right view,
which is in complete contrast to it. It is an episode in the <em>Ummaggajātaka</em>
which more or less looks like a parable to illustrate this point.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn343-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn343">44</a></sup> In the
<em>Ummaggajātaka</em> one comes across the problem of a gem. In that story there are
in fact several such problems concerning gems, and we are taking up just one of
them.</p>
<p>The citizens of Mithilā came and informed king Videha that there is a gem in
the pond near the city gate. The king commissioned his royal adviser Senaka with
the task of taking out the gem. He went and got the people to empty the pond but
failed to find the gem there. Even the mud was taken out and the earth dug up in
a vain attempt to locate the gem.</p>
<p>When he confessed his failure to the king, the latter entrusted the job to
<em>bodhisatta</em> Mahosadha, the youngest adviser. When he went there and had a look
around, he immediately understood that the gem is actually in a crow’s nest on a
palm tree near the pond. What appeared in the pond is only its reflection. He
convinced the king of this fact by getting a man to immerse a bowl of water into
the pond, which also reflected the gem. Then the man climbed up the palm tree
and found the gem there, as predicted by Mahosadha.</p>
<p>If we take this episode as an illustration, the view of the dogmatists can be
compared to Senaka’s view. The discovery of the Buddha that name-and-form is a
mere reflection is like the solution advanced by <em>bodhisatta</em> Mahosadha to the
problem of the gem in the pond.</p>
<p>Now what is the role of personality view in this connection? It is said that the
Buddha preached the Dhamma adopting a via media between two extreme views. What
are they? The eternalist view and the nihilist view. The eternalist view is like
that attachment to the reflection.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when one sees one’s own image in water, one falls in love with it,
imagining it to be someone else, as in the case of the dog on the plank
mentioned in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn344-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn344">45</a></sup> It can sometimes arouse hate as well.
Thus there could be both self-love and self-hate.</p>
<p>Inclining towards these two attitudes, the personality view itself leads to the
two extreme views known as eternalism and nihilism, or annihilationism. It is
like Senaka’s attempt to find the gem by emptying the water and digging the
bottom of the pond. The Buddha avoids both these extremes by understanding that
this name-and-form is a reflection, owing to the reflective nature of this pond
of consciousness. It has no essence.</p>
<p>The name in this name-and-form, as we have already stated in an earlier sermon,
is merely a formal name, or an apparent name.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn345-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn345">46</a></sup> And the form here is only
a nominal form, a form only in name. There is neither an actual name nor a
substantial form here. Name is only apparent, and form is only nominal. With
this preliminary understanding one has to arouse that wisdom by building up the
ability to see through name-and-form, in order to win to freedom from this
name-and-form.</p>
<p>So, in this sermon, our special attention has been on name-and-form, on the
interrelation between name-and-form and consciousness. All this reveals to us
the importance of the first two lines of the problematic verse already quoted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>viññānaṁ anidassanaṁ anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn346-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn346">47</a></sup></p>
<p>consciousness which is non-manifestative, endless, lustrous on all sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Buddha’s vision, by fully comprehending the fact that
name-and-form is a mere image, or reflection, the non-manifestative
consciousness develops the penetrative power to see through it. But those
others, who could not understand that it is a reflection, aroused self-love and
self-hate.</p>
<p>It is as if one is trying to outstrip one’s shadow by running towards it out of
fun, while the other is trying to flee from it out of fear. Such is the nature
of the two extreme views in this world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvīhi, bhikkhave, diṭṭhigatehi pariyuṭṭhitā devamanussā olīyanti eke,
atidhāvanti eke, cakkhumanto ca passanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn347-1"><a href="sermon-09.html#fn-fn347">48</a></sup></p>
<p>Obsessed by two views, monks, are gods and men, some of whom lag behind, while
others overreach, only they do see that have eyes to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, the collection of the ‘thus said’ discourses, sums
up the situation in the world. Some fall back and lag behind, while others
overstep and overreach. It is only they that see, who have eyes to see.</p>

<p>This is the tenth sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna. With the help of a
parable based on the problem of the gem in the <em>Ummaggajātaka</em>, we made an
attempt, towards the end of our last sermon, to clarify to some extent how the
personality view arises due to the ignorance of the fact that name-and-form is
something reflected on consciousness.</p>
<p>We mentioned in brief how a certain would-be wise man took the trouble to empty
a pond and even dig out the mud under the impression that there is actually a
gem in it, simply because there appeared to be a gem in the pond.</p>
<p>Similarly, by taking to be real name-and-form, which is only an image reflected
on consciousness leading to a personality view, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, both eternalism
and nihilism, built on the two views of existence and non-existence, tended
towards two extremes. Under the influence of self love, eternalism took up the
view that there is a self, and looked forward to its perpetuation. Prompted by
self hate, annihilationism or nihilism cherished the fond hope that the release
from this self will occur at death. Both these extreme views confuse the issue
by not understanding the reflected image as such.</p>
<p>Now how did the middle path, which the Buddha introduced to the world, avoid
these two extremes? It is by offering a knowledge and vision of things as they
are, <em>yathābhūtañāṇadassana</em>, in place of those two views of existence and
non-existence. In other words, he made known to the world the true knowledge and
vision that name-and-form is merely an image reflected on consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a special significance in the word <em>yathābhūta</em>. In contradistinction
to the two words <em>bhava</em> and <em>vibhava</em>, the word <em>bhūta</em> has some peculiarity of
its own. In order to clarify the meaning of the term <em>yathābhūta</em>, we can draw
upon a discourse in the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, a few lines of which we had already quoted
at the end of the previous sermon. When presented in full, that discourse will
make it clear why the Buddha introduced the word <em>bhūta</em> in preference to the
existing usage in terms of <em>bhava</em> and <em>vibhava</em>. This is how that discourse
proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvīhi, bhikkhave, diṭṭhigatehi pariyuṭṭhitā devamanussā olīyanti eke,
atidhāvanti eke, cakkhumanto va passanti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke?
Bhavārāmā, bhikkhave, devamanussā bhavaratā bhavasammuditā, tesaṁ
bhavanirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne cittaṁ na pakkhandati na pasīdati na
santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke.</em></p>
<p><em>Kathañca, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke? Bhaveneva kho pana eke aṭṭīyamānā
harāyamānā jigucchamānā vibhavaṁ abhinandanti – yato kira, bho, ayaṁ attā
kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā ucchijjati vinassati na hoti paraṁ maraṇā, etaṁ
santaṁ etaṁ paṇītaṁ etaṁ yāthāvanti. Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke.</em></p>
<p><em>Kathañca, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto passanti? Idha bhikkhu bhūtaṁ bhūtato
passati, bhūtaṁ bhūtato disvā bhūtassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno
hoti. Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto va passantī’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn349-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn349">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Obsessed by two views, monks, are gods and men, some of whom lag behind, while
others overreach. Only they do see that have eyes to see. How, monks, do some
lag behind? Gods and men, monks, delight in existence, they are attached to
existence, they rejoice in existence. When Dhamma is being preached to them
for the cessation of existence, their minds do not reach out towards it, do
not get pleased in it, do not get steadied in it, do not rest confident with
it. It is thus that some lag behind.</p>
<p>How, monks, do some overreach? Being troubled, ashamed, and disgusted of
existence as such, some delight in non-existence – since this self, at the
breaking up of this body after death, will be annihilated and destroyed, this
is peace, this is excellent, this is how it should be. Thus, monks do some
overreach.</p>
<p>And how, monks, do those with eyes see? Herein a monk sees the become as
become. Having seen the become as become, he is treading the path towards
dejection, dispassion and cessation regarding becoming. Thus it is, monks,
that those with eyes see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage clearly brings out the extreme nature of those two views of
existence and non-existence. The two verses occurring at the end of this sutta
present the gist of the discourse even more clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye bhūtaṁ bhūtato disvā,</em> <br />
<em>bhūtassa ca atikkamaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yathābhūte vimuccanti,</em> <br />
<em>bhavataṇhā parikkhayā.</em></p>
<p><em>Sa ve bhūtapariñño so,</em> <br />
<em>vītataṇho bhavābhave,</em> <br />
<em>bhūtassa vibhavā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nāgacchati punabbhavaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Those who have seen the become as become, <br />
As well as the going beyond of whatever has become, <br />
Are released in regard to things as they are, <br />
By the exhaustion of craving for becoming.</p>
<p>That monk, who has fully comprehended the become, <br />
Who is devoid of craving for continued becoming, <br />
By the discontinuation of what has become, <br />
Will not come back again to a state of becoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is extremely clear, even from the quotation as it stands, that the Buddha
has interposed this word <em>bhūta</em> between the dichotomous terms <em>bhava</em> and
<em>vibhava</em>. In the contemporary society, these two terms were used to denote the
existence and the destruction of a soul. This usage is clearly revealed by some
discourses, in which those who held on to similar views expressed them in such
terms as <em>bhavissāmi</em> and <em>na bhavissāmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn350-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn350">3</a></sup> These expressions, meaning ‘I
will be’ and ‘I will not be’, carry with them an implication of a person or a
self.</p>
<p>The term <em>bhūta</em>, on the other hand, is not amenable to such a usage. It has the
passive sense of something that has become. Like that reflection mentioned
earlier, it conveys the idea of being produced by causes and conditions. Going
by the analogy of the reflected image mentioned above, the eternalist, because
of his narcissistic selflove, gets attached to his own self image and lags
behind. When the Buddha preaches the Dhamma for the cessation of existence, he
shrinks from fear that it would lead to the destruction of his self. It is like
the narcissistic attempt to embrace one’s own image in water out of self love.</p>
<p>The annihilationist view leads to an attitude of escapism, like that of one who
is obsessed by his own shadow. One cannot outstrip one’s own shadow. It is only
a vain attempt. So also is the fond hope of the nihilist that by simply negating
self one can be free from repeated birth. It turns out to be mere wishful
thinking, because simply by virtue of the view ‘I shall not be after death’ one
cannot win deliverance, so long as such defilements like ignorance and craving
are there. These were the two extremes towards which those two dogmatic views of
eternalism and annihilationism tended.</p>
<p>By introducing the term <em>bhūta</em> the Buddha made it known that the five groups
are the product of causes and conditions, that they are conditionally arisen. In
the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, for instance, one comes across the following significant
lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jātaṁ bhūtaṁ samuppannaṁ, kataṁ saṅkhatamaddhuvaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn351-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn351">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference here is to the five groups of grasping. They are ‘born’, ‘become’,
‘arisen’ (that is conditionally arisen), ‘made up’, ‘prepared’, and ‘unstable’.
These words are suggestive of some artificiality. The word <em>addhuvaṁ</em> brings out
their impermanence and insubstantiality. There is no eternal essence, like
<em>sat</em>, or being. It is merely a self image, a reflection. So it seems that the
word <em>bhūta</em> has connotations of being a product of causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of the scare it has aroused in the soul-theorists, Nibbāna
is not something that destroys a truly existing entity. Though Nibbāna is called
<em>bhavanirodha</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn352-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn352">5</a></sup> cessation of existence, according to the outlook of the
Buddha the worldlings have merely a craving for existence, <em>bhavataṅhā</em>, and not
a real existence. It is only a conceit of existence, the conceit ‘am’,
<em>asmimāna</em>.</p>
<p>In reality it amounts to a craving, and this is the significance of the term
<em>taṅhā ponobhāvikā</em>, craving which makes for re-becoming. Because of that
craving, which is always bent forward, worldlings keep running round in
<em>saṁsāra</em>. But on analysis a concrete situation always reveals a state of a
become, a <em>bhūta</em>, as something produced by causes and conditions.</p>
<p>A donkey drags a wagon when a carrot is projected towards it from the wagon. The
journey of beings in <em>saṁsāra</em> is something like that. So what we have here is
not the destruction of some existing essence of being or a soul. From the point
of view of the Dhamma the cessation of existence, or <em>bhavanirodha</em>, amounts to
a stopping of the process of becoming, by the removal of the causes leading to
it, namely ignorance and craving. It is, in effect, the cessation of suffering
itself.</p>
<p>Those who held on to the annihilationist view, entertained the hope that their
view itself entitled them to their cherished goal. But it was in vain, because
the ignorance, craving, and grasping within them created for them the five
groups of grasping, or this mass of suffering, again and again despite their
view, <em>uppajjati dukkham idaṁ punappunaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>So what we have here is a deep philosophy of things as they are, which follows a
certain law of causality. The Buddha’s middle path is based on this knowledge
and vision of things as they are, avoiding both extremes of self indulgence and
self mortification.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the question of existence involved in this context. The
terms <em>bhava</em> and <em>vibhava</em> are generally associated with the idea of worlds’
existence. Some seem to take <em>atthi</em>, or ‘is’, as the basic element in the
grammatical structure. Very often those upholders of dogmatic views brought up
such propositions as ‘everything exists’, <em>sabbaṁ atthi</em>, and ‘nothing exists’,
<em>sabbaṁ natthi</em>, before the Buddha, expecting him to give a categorical
answer.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn353-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn353">6</a></sup></p>
<p>But the Buddha pointed out that <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is more basic than the usage of
‘is’ and ‘is not’. The most elementary concept is <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’. Hence the
term <em>asmimāna</em>, the conceit ‘am’. In the grammatical structure, the pride of
place should be given to <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’. We sometimes tend to regard <em>atthi</em>,
or ‘is’, as the primary term. But <em>asmi</em> deserves pride of place in so far as it
is the basic element in the grammatical structure. It is like the central peg
from which all measurings and surveyings of the world start, since the word
<em>māna</em> in <em>asmimāna</em> also means ‘measuring’. Given <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’, everything
else comes to be.</p>
<p>Let us take an illustration. If, for instance, we say “there is something”,
someone will pose the question: “Where is it?” It should be either here or there
or yonder, that is, over there. It can be in one of those three places. Now, if
it is here, how does that place become a ‘here’? That is where I am. ‘There’ is
where he is, and ‘yonder’ is where you are.</p>
<p>So we have here the framework of the grammar. Here is the basic lining up for
the formation of the grammatical structure, its most elementary pattern. So,
then, ‘I am’, ‘you are’, and ‘he is’. In this way we see that one can speak of
the existence of something relative to a viewpoint represented by ‘am’ or ‘I
am’. That is why the Buddha rejected as extremes the two views of absolute
existence and absolute non-existence, based on ‘is’, <em>atthi</em>, and ‘is not’,
<em>natthi</em>.</p>
<p>Only when there is an ‘I’, can something exist relative to that I. And that
something, if it is ‘there’, it is where ‘I’ am not present, or at a distance
from me. If it is ‘yonder’, or over there, it is before you who are in front of
me. And if it is ‘here’, it is beside me. From this we can see that this conceit
‘am’ is, as it were, the origin of the whole world, the origin of the world of
grammar.</p>
<p>On a previous occasion, too, while discussing the significance of the two terms
<em>itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññathābhāva</em>, we had to make a similar statement.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn354-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn354">7</a></sup> The
Buddha draws our attention to a very important fact in this concern, namely, the
fact that the conceit ‘am’ does not arise without causes and conditions. It is
not something uncaused, and unconditioned. If it is uncaused and unconditioned,
it can never be made to cease. The notion ‘am’ arises due to certain causes and
conditions. There is a word suggestive of this causal origin, namely <em>upādāya</em>.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, we use the term <em>pañc’upādānakkhandha</em>. When we speak of the
five groups of grasping, the word <em>upādāna</em> (<em>upa + ā + dā</em>) is often rendered
by grasping. The prefix <em>upa</em> is supposed to imply the tenacity of the
hold.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn355-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn355">8</a></sup></p>
<p>One can therefore ask whether it is not sufficient to relax the hold on the five
groups. Strictly speaking, the prefix <em>upa</em> in <em>upādāna</em> conveys the sense of
proximity or nearness. Sometimes the two words <em>upeti</em> and <em>upādiyati</em> are found
in juxtaposition. <em>Upeti</em>, <em>upa + i</em>, to go, means ‘coming near’ or
‘approaching’, and <em>upādiyati</em> has the sense of ‘holding on to’, having come
close. In other words, we have here not only a case of holding, but of holding
‘on to’.</p>
<p>So the totality of existence, from the point of view of Dhamma, is dependent on
a holding on, or a grasping on. It is not something uncaused and unconditioned.
Here we may remind ourselves of the simile of the winding of a rope or a cord
which we brought up in a previous sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn356-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn356">9</a></sup> We cannot help going back to
the same simile again and again, if we are to deepen our understanding of the
Dhamma.</p>
<p>In that illustration we spoke of two persons winding up several strands to make
a rope or a cord. But both are winding in the same direction from either end.
Such an attempt at winding, however long it is continued, does not result in an
actual winding, for the simple reason that the winding from one end is
continually being unwinded from the other end. But what happens if a third
person catches hold of the rope in the middle? Due to that hold on the middle,
something like a rope appears to get winded up.</p>
<p>Now existence, too, is something similar. It is because of the hold in the
middle that the rope gets wound up. From the point of view of an outsider, the
one in the middle is holding on to a rope. But the truth is, that the semblance
of a rope is there due to that holding on itself. This, then, is the norm of
this world. “Whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to
cease,” <em>yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn357-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn357">10</a></sup></p>
<p>It is in the nature of things that every winding ends up in an unwinding. But
because of that hold in the middle, the windings get accumulated. Just because
of his hold in the middle, his hand is under stress and strain. Similarly, the
stress and strain that is existence is also due to a grasping or a holding on
to, <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, we have not given this illustration merely for the sake of a simile. We
can adduce reasons for its validity even from the discourses. This word
<em>upādāya</em> is particularly noteworthy. As we have already shown, <em>upādāna</em> does
not simply mean grasping, or grasping rigidly, but holding on to something,
having come close to it. This holding on creates a certain relationship, which
may be technically termed a relativity. The two stand relative to each other.
For instance, that rope exists relative to the grasping of the person who holds
on to it. Now <em>upādāya</em> is the absolutive form of <em>upādāna</em>, it has the
implication of something relative.</p>
<p>There is a discourse in the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>, which clearly reveals this fact.
It is a sermon preached by Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta to Venerable Ānanda.
This is the relevant paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Upādāya, āvuso Ānanda, asmīti hoti, no anupādāya. Kiñca upādāya asmīti hoti,
no anupādāya? Rūpaṁ upādāya asmīti hoti, no anupādāya; vedanaṁ upādāya asmīti
hoti, no anupādāya; saññaṁ upādāya asmīti hoti, no anupādāya; saṅkhāre upādāya
asmīti hoti, no anupādāya; viññāṇaṁ upādāya asmīti hoti, no anupādāya.
Upādāya, āvuso Ānanda, asmīti hoti, no anupādāya.</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, āvuso Ānanda, itthī vā puriso vā daharo yuvā maṇḍanakajātiko
ādāse vā parisuddhe pariyodāte acche vā udakapatte sakaṁ mukhanimittaṁ
paccavekkhamāno upādāya passeyya, no anupādāya, evam eva kho, āvuso Ānanda,
upādāya asmīti hoti, no anupādāya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn358-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn358">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us now try to get at the meaning of this important passage, which should
clarify further what we have already attempted to explain through similes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is with dependence, friend Ānanda, that the notion ‘am’ occurs, not without
dependence. With dependence on what, does the notion ‘am’ occur, and not
without dependence? With dependence on form does the notion ‘am’ occur, not
without dependence; with dependence on feeling does the notion ‘am’ occur, not
without dependence; with dependence on perception does the notion ‘am’ occur,
not without dependence; with dependence on preparations does the notion ‘am’
occur, not without dependence; with dependence on consciousness does the
notion ‘am’ occur, not without dependence.</p>
<p>Just as, friend Ānanda, a woman or a man, youthful and fond of adornment, in
looking at her or his facial image in a mirror or in a bowl filled with pure,
clear, clean water, would be seeing it with dependence and not without
dependence, even so, friend Ānanda, it is with dependence that the notion ‘am’
occurs, not without dependence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it is rather difficult to render the word <em>upādāya</em>. It means ‘in
dependence on’ something and has a relative sense. Reinforced with the emphatic
double negative, the assertion seems to imply that the notion ‘am’ is something
dependent and not independent, that it arises due to causes and conditions. In
the explanation that follows, this dictum is substantiated by bringing in the
five groups or aggregates, relative to which one posits an ‘am’.</p>
<p>The subsequent illustration serves to bring out the required nuance of the term
<em>upādāya</em>, which is more often connected with the rather gross idea of grasping.
The young woman or the young man is looking at her or his face in a mirror. They
can see their own face, or the sign of it, <em>mukhanimitta</em>, only with the help of
a mirror, that is, as an image reflected on it. They are dependent on a mirror
or a similar object for seeing their own face, not independent.</p>
<p>What Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta seems to stress, is that the notion ‘am’ is
the result of grasping or holding on to form, feeling, perception, preparations,
and consciousness. It is when one looks into a mirror that one suddenly becomes
self-conscious. Whether one has a liking or a dislike for what one sees, one
gets the notion ‘this is me’. So it is by coming close to a mirror which
reflects one’s facial image that the notion ‘am’ occurs depending on it. The
word <em>upādāya</em> therefore approximates to the idea of coming close and holding on
to.</p>
<p>That notion occurs due to a relationship arising from that holding on. Even if
one already has no such notion, the moment one looks into a mirror one is
suddenly reminded of it, as if to exclaim: “Ah, here I am!” This is the gist of
what Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta is trying to put across through this
discourse.</p>
<p>This shows that the conceit ‘am’ arises due to the five grasping groups. The
absolutive <em>upādāya</em>, though akin to <em>upādāna</em>, has a deeper significance. It is
a word suggestive of a relationship. It does not merely mean a holding on, but
also a certain necessary relationship arising out of that holding on.</p>
<p>Just as the looking into a mirror or a bowl of water gives rise to a facial
image as a reflection, here too the relationship calls forth the deluded
reflection “here I am”. Given the notion “here I am”, there follows the
corollary “things that are mine”.</p>
<p>So there is supposed to be an ‘I’ in contradistinction to things that are
‘mine’. It is the difficulty to demarcate the area of applicability between
these two concepts that has given rise to insoluble problems. “Who am I and what
is mine?” The twenty modes of personality view, <em>sakkāya diṭṭhi</em>, portray how
one is at one’s wit’s end to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Let us now see how the twenty modes of personality view are made up. For
instance, as regards form, it is fourfold as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpaṁ attato samanupassati, rūpavantaṁ vā attānaṁ, attani vā rūpaṁ, rūpasmiṁ
vā attānaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn359-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn359">12</a></sup></p>
<p>He regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or
self as in form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the same with the other four groups. In this way, the personality view is
altogether twenty-fold.</p>
<p>All this comes about due to the ignorance that name-and-form is only a
reflection, like that facial image. In grasping this self image of name-and-form
one grasps the five groups. Attachment to name-and-form amounts to a holding on
to these five groups. To many, the relationship between name-and-form and the
grasping groups appears as a big puzzle. Wherever one looks, one sees this self
image of name-and-form. But when one grasps it, what comes within the grasp is a
group of form, feeling, perception, preparations, and consciousness.</p>
<p>The magical illusion created by consciousness is so complete that it is capable
of playing a dual role, as in double acting. Because it reflects, like a mirror,
consciousness itself is grasped, just as one grasps the mirror. Not only the
reflection of the mirror, but the mirror itself is grasped. The grasping group
of consciousness represents such a predicament.</p>
<p>One can form an idea about the relation between name-and-form and consciousness
by going deeper into the implications of this discourse. In the discussion of
the interrelation between name and form, the Buddha makes use of two highly
significant terms, namely <em>adhivacanasamphassa</em> and <em>paṭighasamphassa.</em></p>
<p>How contact arises dependent on name-and-form is explained by the Buddha in the
<em>Mahānidānasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn360-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn360">13</a></sup> It is addressed to Venerable
Ānanda in the form of a catechism.</p>
<p><em>Phassa</em>, or contact, is a sort of hybrid, carrying with it the implications of
both <em>adhivacanasamphassa</em> and <em>paṭighasamphassa</em>. That is to say, it partakes
of the character of name, <em>nāma</em>, as suggested by <em>adhivacanasamphassa</em>, as well
as that of form, <em>rūpa</em>, indicated by <em>paṭighasamphassa</em>. This will be clear
from the relevant section of the catechism in the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Nāmarūpapaccayā phasso’ti iti kho panetaṁ vuttaṁ, tad’Ānanda, imināpetaṁ
pariyāyena veditabbaṁ, yathā nāmarūpapaccayā phasso. Yehi, Ānanda, ākārehi

<p><em>“No hetaṁ, bhante.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yehi, Ānanda, ākārehi yehi liṅgehi yehi nimittehi yehi uddesehi rūpakāyassa

<p><em>“No hetaṁ, bhante.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yehi, Ānanda, ākārehi yehi liṅgehi yehi nimittehi yehi uddesehi nāmakāyassa

<p><em>“No hetaṁ, bhante.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yehi, Ānanda, ākārehi yehi liṅgehi yehi nimittehi yehi uddesehi nāmarūpassa

<p><em>“Tasmātih’Ānanda, eseva hetu etaṁ nidānaṁ esa samudayo esa paccayo phassassa,

<p>“From name-and-form as condition, contact comes to be. Thus it has been said
above. And that Ānanda, should be understood in this manner, too, as to how
from name-and-form as condition, contact arises. If, Ānanda, all those modes,
characteristics, signs and exponents, by which the name-group, <em>nāma-kāya</em>, is
designated were absent, would there be manifest any verbal impression,
<em>adhivacanasamphassa</em>, in the form-group, <em>rūpa-kāya</em>?”</p>
<p>“There would not, lord.”</p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, all those modes, characteristics, signs and exponents, by which
the form-group is designated were absent, would there be manifest any
resistance-impression, <em>paṭighasamphasso</em>, in the name-group?”</p>
<p>“There would not, lord.”</p>
<p>“And if, Ānanda, all those modes, characteristics, signs and exponents, by
which there is a designation of both name-group and form-group were absent,
would there be manifest either any verbal impression or any
resistance-impression?”</p>
<p>“There would not, lord.”</p>
<p>“And if, Ānanda, all those modes, characteristics, signs and exponents, by
which there comes to be a designation of name-and-form were absent, would
there be manifest any contact?”</p>
<p>“There would not, lord.”</p>
<p>“Wherefore, Ānanda, this itself is the cause, this is the origin, this is the
condition for contact, that is to say, name-and-form.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the help of four words of allied sense, namely <em>ākāra</em>, mode, <em>liṅga</em>,
characteristic, <em>nimitta</em>, sign, and <em>uddesa</em>, exponent, the Buddha
catechetically brings out four conclusions by this disquisition. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By whatever modes, characteristics, signs and exponents the name-group,
<em>nāma-kāya</em>, is designated, in their absence no designation of verbal
impression, <em>adhivacanasamphassa</em>, in the form-group, <em>rūpa-kāya</em>, is
possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By whatever modes, characteristics, signs and exponents the form-group is
designated, in their absence no designation of resistance-impression,
<em>paṭighasamphasso</em>, in the name-group, <em>nāmakāya</em>, is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By whatever modes, characteristics, signs and exponents both name-group and
form-group are designated, in their absence no designation of verbal
impression or resistance-impression is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By whatever modes, characteristics, signs and exponents name-and-form is
designated, in their absence no designation of contact is possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All this may well appear like a riddle, but then let us consider what
name-and-form means, to begin with. The definition we gave to <em>nāma</em> in our very
first sermon happened to be different from the well known definition nowadays
given in terms of a bending.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn361-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn361">14</a></sup></p>
<p>We interpreted <em>nāma</em> in the sense of a ‘naming’. Now this term <em>adhivacana</em>
also conveys the same idea. <em>Adhivacana</em>, synonym, <em>nirutti</em>, nomenclature, and
<em>paññatti</em>, designation, are part and parcel of linguistic usage.</p>
<p>In the <em>Niruttipathasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> one comes across three
terms, <em>niruttipatha, adhivacanapatha,</em> and <em>paññattipatha</em>, pathways of
nomenclature, pathways of synonyms, pathways of designation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn362-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn362">15</a></sup> There three
terms are closely allied in meaning, in that they bring out in sharp relief
three aspects of linguistic usage.</p>
<p><em>Nirutti</em> emphasises the explanatory or expository function of language,
<em>adhivacana</em> its symbolic and metaphorical character, while <em>paññatti</em> brings
out its dependence on convention.</p>
<p>What we have here is <em>adhivacanasamphassa</em>. Its affinity to name is obvious, and
this is precisely the meaning we attributed to <em>nāma</em>. Therefore, what we have
in this concept of <em>nāmakāya</em>, or name-group, literally ‘name-body’, is a set of
first principles in linguistic usage pertaining to definition.</p>
<p>The form-group, or <em>rūpakāya</em>, literally ‘form-body’, on the other hand has
something to do with resistance, as suggested by the term <em>paṭighasamphassa</em>.
<em>Paṭigha</em> means ‘striking against’. Form, or <em>rūpa,</em> has a striking quality,
while name, or <em>nāma,</em> has a descriptive quality. <em>Phassa</em>, or contact, is a
hybrid of these two. This is what gives a deeper dimension to the above
disquisition.</p>
<p>The point that the Buddha seeks to drive home is the fact that the concept of
contact necessarily presupposes both name and form. In other words, name and
form are mutually interrelated, as already stated above. There would be no
verbal impression in the form-group, if there were no modes, characteristics,
etc., proper to name. Likewise there could be no resistant impression in the
name-group, if there were no modes, characteristics, etc., proper to form.</p>
<p>At first sight these two may appear as totally opposed to each other. But what
is implied is a case of mutual interrelation. The expression peculiar to the
name-group is a necessary condition for the form-group, while the resistance
peculiar to the form-group is a necessary condition for the name-group. Since
here we have something deep, let us go for an illustration for the sake of
clarity.</p>
<p>As we have already stated, a verbal impression in regard to the form-group is
there because of the constituents of the name-group. Now the form-group consists
of the four great primaries earth, water, fire and air. Even to distinguish
between them by their qualities of hardness and softness, hotness and coolness,
etc., feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention, which are the
constituents of the name-group, have to play their part. Thus it is with the
help of those members on the name side that the four basic elements associated
with form receive recognition.</p>
<p>Metaphor is a figure of speech, common in ornate literary language as well as in
technical terminology. Here the inanimate is animated by personification. What
is proper to the animate world is superimposed on the inanimate. Now the word
<em>adhivacana</em> is, even literally, a superimposition, and it is a term with
obvious metaphorical associations. Whereas in the literary field it has an
ornate value as a figurative expression, in technical usage it serves the
purpose of facility of expression by getting the tools to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>For instance, a carpenter might speak of two planks touching each other as if
they can actually touch and feel. The concept of touch, even when it is
attributed to inanimate objects, is the outcome of attention, in this case the
attention of the carpenter. Here, again, we are reminded of the role of
attention in the origination of things as stated in the <em>Kiṁmūlakasutta</em> and
<em>Samiddhisutta</em> discussed above.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn363-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn363">16</a></sup></p>
<p>In accordance with the dictum “Mind is the forerunner of all things”,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn364-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn364">17</a></sup>
“All things are rooted in interest, they originate with attention and arise out
of contact”, <em>chandamūlakā, āvuso, sabbe dhammā, manasikārasambhavā,
phassasamudayā</em> (etc.).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn365-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn365">18</a></sup> Wherever the carpenter’s interest went, his
attention discovered and picked up the thing, and here the thing is the fact of
two planks touching each other.</p>
<p>Interest, attention and contact together bring out some deeper implications of
the law of dependent arising. Not only with regard to inanimate objects, but
even in the case of this conscious body, the question of contact is related to
the fact of attention.</p>
<p>If, for instance I ask what I am touching now, one might say that I am touching
the palm leaf fan in my hand. This is because we usually associate the idea of
touching with the hand that holds. But suppose I put away the fan and ask again
what I am touching now, one might find it difficult to answer. It might not be
possible for another to guess by mere external observation, since it is
essentially subjective. It is dependent on my attention. It could even be my
robe that I am touching in the sense of contact, in which case I am becoming
conscious of my body as apart from the robe I am wearing.</p>
<p>Consciousness follows in the wake of attention. Whatever my attention picks up,
of that I am conscious. Though I have in front of me so many apparently visible
objects, until my attention is focussed, eye-consciousness does not come about.
The basic function of this type of consciousness, then, is to distinguish
between the eye and the object seen. It is only after the eye has become
conscious, that other factors necessary for sense perception fall into place.</p>
<p>The two things born of that basic discrimination, together with the
discriminating consciousness itself, that is eye-consciousness, make up the
concept of contact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati
phasso</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn366-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn366">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Dependent on eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises, the concurrence of the
three is contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same principle holds good in the case of the two planks touching each other.
All this goes to show that it is with the help of the factors in the name-group
that we can even metaphorically speak of a contact between inanimate things.</p>
<p>Let us now consider how resistance-impression, <em>paṭighasamphassa</em>, comes about.
It is said that the factors of the form-group have a part to play in producing
resistance-impression on the name-group. We sometimes speak of an idea ‘striking
us’, as if it were something material. Or else an idea could be ‘at the back’ of
our mind and a word ‘on the tip’ of our tongue.</p>
<p>The clearest manifestation of contact is that between material objects, where
collision is suggestive of resistance, as implied by the word <em>paṭigha</em>. This
primary sense of striking against or striking together is implicit even in the
simile given by the Buddha in the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>,
and in the <em>Phassamūlakasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, concerning two sticks
being rubbed together to kindle a fire.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn367-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn367">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Though as a gross manifestation contact is primarily associated with the
form-group, it is essentially connected with the name-group, as we have already
explained with illustrations. It is when both resistance-impression and verbal
impression come together that contact arises, dependent on name-and-form,
<em>nāmarūpapaccayā phasso</em>.</p>
<p>Another point that needs to be clarified in this connection is the exact
significance of the word <em>rūpa</em>. This word has been variously interpreted and
explained among different Buddhist sects. How did the Buddha define <em>rūpa</em>? In
ordinary usage it can mean either forms visible to the eye, or whatever is
generally spoken of as ‘material’. Its exact significance has become a subject
of controversy. What precisely do we mean by ‘<em>rūpa</em>’?</p>
<p>The Buddha himself has explained the word, giving the following etymology in the
<em>Khajjanīyasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. While
defining the five groups there, he defines the form group as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiñca, bhikkhave, rūpaṁ vadetha? Ruppatī’ti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā rūpan’ti
vuccati. Kena ruppati? Sītena pi ruppati, uṇhena pi ruppati, jighacchāya pi
ruppati, pipāsāya pi ruppati, daṁsamakasavātātapasiriṁsapasamphassena pi
ruppati. Ruppatī’ti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā rūpan’ti vuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn368-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn368">21</a></sup></p>
<p>And what, monks, do you call <em>rūpa</em>? It is affected, monks, that is why it is
called <em>rūpa</em>. Affected by what? Affected by cold, affected by heat, affected
by hunger, affected by thirst, affected by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes,
wind, sun and serpents. It is affected, monks, that is why it is called
<em>rūpa</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition seems to convey something very deep, so much so that various
Buddhist sects came out with various interpretations of this passage. The Buddha
departs from the way of approach taken up by the materialistic systems of
thought in the world in defining <em>rūpa</em> with <em>ruppati</em>, ‘being affected’.</p>
<p>It is not the inanimate trees and rocks in the world that are said to be
affected by cold and heat, but this conscious body. So this body is not
conceived of as a bundle of atoms to be animated by introducing into it a life
faculty, <em>jīvitindriya</em>. What is meant by <em>rūpa</em> is this same body, this body
with form, which, for the meditator, is a fact of experience.</p>
<p>Attempts at interpretation from a scholastic point of view created a lot of
complications. But the definition, as it stands, is clear enough. It is directly
addressed to experience. The purpose of the entire Dhamma preached by the Buddha
is not to encourage an academic dabbling in philosophical subtleties with a mere
jumble of words. The purpose is utter disenchantment, dispassion and cessation,
<em>ekantanibbidāya, virāgāya, nirodhāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn369-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn369">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore the etymology given here in terms of <em>ruppati</em>, ‘to be affected’, is
in full accord with that purpose. <em>Rūpa</em> is so called, because it is affected by
cold, heat, and the sting of gadflies, mosquitoes, etc., not because of any
atomism in it.</p>
<p>If we are to examine further the meaning of this verb <em>ruppati</em>, we can count on
the following quotation from the <em>Piṅgiyasutta</em> of the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> in the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ruppanti rūpesu janā pamattā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn370-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn370">23</a></sup></p>
<p>heedless men are affected in regard to forms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The canonical commentary <em>Cūḷaniddesa</em>, commenting on the word, brings out the
various nuances connected with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ruppantīti kuppanti pīḷayanti ghaṭṭayanti byādhitā domanassitā honti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn371-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn371">24</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Ruppanti</em> means to be adversely affected, to be afflicted, to come into
contact with, to be dis-eased and dis-pleased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely it is not the trees and rocks that are affected in this manner. It is
this animate body that is subject to all this. The pragmatic purpose of utter
detachment, dispassion and cessation is clear enough even from this commentary.</p>
<p>What is known as the form-group, <em>rūpakkhandha</em>, is one vast wound with nine
apertures.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn372-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn372">25</a></sup> This wound is affected when it is touched by cold and heat,
when gadflies and mosquitoes land on it. This wound gets irritated by them.</p>
<p>We come across yet another canonical reference in support of these nuances in
the following two lines in the <em>Uṭṭhānasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Āturānañhi kā niddā, sallaviddhāna ruppataṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn373-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn373">26</a></sup></p>
<p>For what sleep could there be for those who are afflicted, being pierced with
a dart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two lines stress the need for heedfulness for beings pierced with the
arrow of craving. Here, too, the verb <em>ruppati</em> has the sense of being affected
or afflicted. All this goes to show that the early Buddhist concept of <em>rūpa</em>
had a striking simplicity about it.</p>
<p>As we have already stated at the very outset, the teachings in the discourses
are simple enough. But there is a certain depth in this very simplicity, for it
is only when the water is lucid and limpid that one can see the bottom of a
pond. But with the passage of time there was a tendency to lose interest in
these discourses, because of the general predilection for complexity.</p>
<p>Materialistic philosophers, in particular, were carried away by this trend,
whether they were Hindus or Buddhists. Modern day scientists, too, got caught in
this trend. They pursued the materialistic overtones of the word <em>rūpa</em>, without
realizing that they are running after a mirage.</p>
<p>They went on analysing matter, until they ended up with an atomism and grasped a
heap of concepts. The analysis of matter thus precipitated a grasping of a mass
of concepts. Whether one grasps a pole or a mole, it is a grasping all the same.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s admonitions, on the contrary, point in a different direction. He
pointed out that in order to be free from the burdensome oppression of form, one
has to be free from the perception of form. What is of relevance here is the
very perception of form, <em>rūpasaññā</em>. From the point of view of Dhamma, any
attempt at analysis of the materialistic concept of form, or any microscopic
analysis of matter, would lead to a pursuit of a mirage.</p>
<p>This fact, the modern day scientist is now in a position to appreciate. He has
found that the mind with which he carries on the analysis is influencing his
findings at every level. In other words, he has been running after a mirage, due
to his ignorance of the mutual interrelation between name and form. One would
not be in such a plight, if one understands that the real problem at issue is
not that of form, but of the perception of form.</p>
<p>In an earlier sermon we happened to quote a verse which makes it extremely
clear. Let us now hark back to that verse, which occurs in the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>etthesā chijjate jaṭā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn374-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn374">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Where name and form <br />
As well as resistance and perception of form <br />
Are completely cut off, <br />
It is there that the tangle gets snapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire <em>saṁsāric</em> problem is solved when the tangle gets snapped. Name and
form, resistance and perception of form are completely cut off in that
non-manifestative consciousness mentioned in our earlier sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn375-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn375">28</a></sup> That,
in effect, is the end of the tangle within and the tangle without.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the law of dependent arising must have made it clear that
there is an interrelation between name-and-form and consciousness on the one
hand, and between name and form themselves on the other. This, then, is a case
of a tangle within and a tangle without.</p>
<p>Like the central spot of a whirlpool, the deepest point of the entire formula of
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is traceable to the interrelation that obtains between name
and form on the one hand, and between name-and-form and consciousness on the
other.</p>
<p>As far as the significance of perception of form is concerned, the true purpose
of the spiritual endeavour, according to the Buddha, is the very freedom from
this perception of form. How does perception of form come about? It is due to
that ‘striking against’, or resistance. Perception of form arises, for instance,
when gadflies and mosquitoes land on this body.</p>
<p>As we have already mentioned, even the distinctions of hard and soft, etc., with
which we recognize the four elements, is a matter of touching. We are only
trying to measure and gauge the four great primaries with this human frame. We
can never ever comprehend fully the gamut of these four great primaries. But we
are trying to understand them through this human frame in a way that is
meaningful to our lives.</p>
<p>All kinds of beings have their own specific experience of ‘touch’, in relation
to their experience of the four elements. So what we have here is entirely a
question of perception of form.</p>
<p>The true purpose, then, should be the release of one’s mind from this perception
of form. It is only when the mind is freed from resistance and the perception of
form, as well as from name-and-form, that one can win to the deliverance from
this problem of the tangle within and the tangle without that is <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>Yet another fact emerges from the above discussion. The two views of existence
and non-existence, <em>bhava / vibhava</em>, asserting an absolute existence and an
absolute non-existence, seem to have posed an insoluble problem to many
philosophers. Concerning the origin of the world, they wondered whether <em>sat</em>,
or being, came out of <em>asat</em>, or non-being, or vice versa.</p>
<p>All these problems arose out of a misunderstanding about form, or material
objects, as we may well infer from the following two lines of a verse in the
<em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpesu disvā vibhavaṁ bhavañca, vinicchayaṁ kurute jantu loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn376-1"><a href="sermon-10.html#fn-fn376">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Having seen the existence and destruction of material forms, a man in this
world comes to a conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the conclusion? That there is an absolute existence and an absolute
non-existence. One comes to this conclusion drawing an inference from the
behaviour of visible objects.</p>
<p>For instance, we could presume that this machine before us exists in an absolute
sense, ignoring the causes and conditions underlying its existence. The day this
machine is destroyed we would say: “It was, but now it is not.”</p>
<p>The Buddha has pointed out that such absolute views of existence and
non-existence are a result of an incorrect understanding about form. What
actually is involved here is the perception of form. Due to a misconception
about the perception of form, the world inclines towards the two extreme views
of absolute existence and absolute non-existence.</p>
<p>So the whole point of our discussion today has been the clarification of the
mutual interrelation between name and form, to show that name-and-form itself is
only an image, or a shadow, reflected on consciousness.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>This is the eleventh sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna. In our last
sermon, we tried to explain that contact arises dependent on name-and-form,
because form gets a verbal impression by the naming quality in name, and name
gets a resistance-impression by the striking quality in form. In the context of
this Dhamma, contact, properly so-called, is a combination of these two, namely
verbal impression and resistance-impression.</p>
<p>We also happened to mention the other day a new etymological explanation given
by the Buddha to the word <em>rūpa</em>, quoting the relevant passage from the
<em>Khajjanīyasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. He has
defined the form group with reference to ‘affectation’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ruppatī’ti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā rūpan’ti vuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn378-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn378">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It is affected, monks, that is why it is called form. By what is it affected?
By cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the sting of gadflies, mosquitoes and the
like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While analysing the implications of this ‘being affected’, we mentioned that the
form group could be compared to a wound. According to the commentarial exegesis,
too, <em>ruppati</em> means to be adversely affected, to be afflicted, to come into
conflict with, to be diseased and displeased. These are reminiscent of the
responses usually associated with the person who has an easy lacerable wound. To
say that a <em>paṭighasamphassa</em> arises because of this lacerable quality is
therefore very apt.</p>
<p>The primary sense of the word <em>paṭigha</em> is ‘striking against’. Perception of
form arises as a result of an attempt to understand through the factors on the
name side this particular striking against, which resembles the laceration of a
wound.</p>
<p>This perception of form, which follows in the wake of the feeling that arises
when something strikes against form, is like the groping of a blind man in the
dark. Generally, the worldling is in the habit of staring at the form that comes
within his grasp, to ascertain its true nature. Likewise, he touches the form he
sees with his eyes to verify it. As the saying goes: “Seeing is believing, but
touch is the real thing”.</p>
<p>But both these attempts are like the gropings of a blind man. The worldling is
unable to get rid of his delusion completely by either of these methods. It is
because he is accustomed to draw conclusions under the influence of his
perception of the compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>.</p>
<p>The fact that the two extreme views of existence and non-existence are also the
outcome of this perception of the compact in regard to form, is borne out by the
following two lines of the verse we quoted from the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> in our
previous sermon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpesu disvā vibhavaṁ bhavañca, vinicchayaṁ kurute jantu loke</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn379-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn379">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Having seen the existence and destruction of material forms, a man in this
world comes to a conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worldling has the idea that material forms have an absolute existence. This
idea is the result of his perception of form. It is a perception arising out of
his impression of that ‘striking against’. Whatever the level of this perception
of form be, it is not better than the impression of a blind man. The two extreme
views of absolute existence and non-existence in the world are based on this
kind of impression.</p>
<p>Various types of views and opinions current in the world regarding material
forms and matter in general, are the outcome of the notion that they are
absolutely real. There is a tendency in the worldling to presume that what he
grasps with his hands and sees with his eyes exists absolutely. So a thing is
said to exist for some length of time, before it gets destroyed.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion, then, is that all things in the world exist absolutely
and that at some point of time they get absolutely destroyed. This is how the
two extreme views of absolute existence and absolute non-existence have arisen
in this world. This is the outcome of a perception of form, which is tantamount
to a pursuit of a mirage. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The Buddha has declared, in the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em>, that where name-and-form as well as
resistance and perception of form are cut off and surcease, there the entire
<em>saṁsāric</em> problem, which amounts to a tangle within and a tangle without, is
also conclusively solved.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn380-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn380">4</a></sup> That this is so could be inferred to some
extent from what we have discussed so far.</p>
<p><em>Nāma</em> and <em>rūpa</em>, as well as <em>paṭigha-</em> and <em>rūpasaññā</em>, are highly significant
terms. <em>Paṭigha-</em> and <em>rūpasaññā</em> are equivalent to <em>paṭighasamphassa</em> and
<em>adhivacanasamphassa</em> respectively. Now as to this perception of form, it is
basically conditioned by contact. That is why the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> states
that contact is the cause of the two views of existence and non-existence.</p>
<p>In this <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> one finds a series of questions and answers going
deeper and deeper into the analysis of contact, step by step.</p>
<p>The question <em>phasso nu lokasmiṁ kutonidāno</em>, “what is the cause of contact in
this world?”; gets the answer <em>nāmañca rūpañca paṭicca phasso</em>, “dependent on
name-and-form is contact”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn381-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn381">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The next question is: <em>Kismiṁ vibhūte na phussanti phassā</em>, “in the absence of
what, do contacts not bring about contact”, or, “touches do not touch?” It gets
the answer: <em>Rūpe vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>, “in the absence of form, contacts
do not bring about contact”.</p>
<p>The question that comes up next, and the answer given, are extremely important.
They lead to a deep analysis of the Dhamma, so much so that both verses deserve
to be quoted in full. The question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁsametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sukhaṁ dukhaṁ vā pi kathaṁ vibhoti,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ me pabrūhi yathā vibhoti,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ jāniyāmā iti me mano ahu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn382-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn382">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To one constituted in which manner does form cease to exist, <br />
Or, how even pleasure and pain cease to exist, <br />
Do tell me how all these become non-existent, <br />
Let us know this, such a thought arose in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is couched in this extraordinary verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na saññasaññī na visaññasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>no pi asaññī na vibhūtasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn383-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn383">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this verse purports to describe is the state of a person for whom form as
also pleasure and pain has ceased to exist. He is not one with normal
perception, nor is he one with abnormal perception. He is not non-percipient,
nor has he rescinded perception. It is to one constituted in this manner that
form ceases to exist, for, <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> – whatever they may be – have
perception as their source.</p>
<p>The meaning of this verse needs to be clarified further. According to the
<em>Mahāniddesa</em>, the allusion in this verse is to one who is on the path to the
formless realms, having attained the first four absorptions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn384-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn384">8</a></sup> The
commentary is forced to that conclusion, because it takes the phrase <em>na
vibhūtasaññī</em> as negating formless realms as such. The assumption is that the
person referred to is neither conscious with normal perception, nor abnormally
unconscious, nor devoid of perception, as in the attainment of cessation, nor in
one of the formless attainments. So then, the only possibility seemed to be to
identify it with some intermediate state. That is why the <em>Mahāniddesa</em> and the
other commentaries interpret this problematic state as that of one who is on the
path to formless attainments, <em>arūpamaggasamaṅgi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn385-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn385">9</a></sup></p>
<p>However, considerations of context and presentation would lead to a different
conclusion. The extraordinary state alluded to by this verse seems to be a
surpamundane one, which goes far deeper than the so-called intermediate state.
The transcendence of form, indicated here, is more radical than the
transcendence in attaining to formless states. It is a transcendence at a
supramundane level, as we may well infer from the last line of the verse,
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em></p>
<p><em>Papañcasaṅkhā</em> is a term which has a relevance to insight meditation and the
denouement of the sutta is also suggestive of such a background.</p>
<p>The <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>, consisting of sixteen verses, is, from beginning to
end, a network of deep questions and answers leading to levels of insight. The
opening verse, for instance, states the initial problem as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kuto pahūtā kalahā vivādā,</em> <br />
<em>paridevasokā sahamaccharā ca,</em> <br />
<em>mānātimānā saha pesuṇā ca,</em> <br />
<em>kuto pahūtā te tad iṅgha brūhi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn386-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn386">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Whence do spring up contentions and disputes, <br />
Lamentations, sorrows and envies, <br />
And arrogance together with slander, <br />
Whence do they spring up, pray tell me this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in answer to this basic question that this discourse gradually unfolds
itself. In accordance with the law of dependent arising, the cause of
contentions and disputes is said to be the tendency to hold things dear,
<em>piyappahūtā kalahā vivādā</em>.</p>
<p>Then the question is about the cause of this idea of holding things dear. The
cause of it is said to be desire, <em>chandanidānāni piyāni loke.</em> Things dear
originate from desire. Desire, or interest, makes things ‘dear’.</p>
<p>The next question is: What is the origin of desire? Desire is traced to the
distinction between the pleasant and the unpleasant. It is in reply to the
question regarding the origin of this distinction between the pleasant and the
unpleasant that contact is brought in.</p>
<p>In fact, it is the question as to the origin of contact, <em>phasso nu lokasmiṁ
kuto nidāno</em>, which formed the starting point of our discussion. The answer to
that question is name-and-form, <em>nāmañca rūpañca</em>. So in this chain of causes,
the link that comes next to contact is name-and-form.</p>
<p>Now the verse in question beginning with <em>na saññasaññī</em> goes deeper than
name-and-form. Even the question about contact has a peculiar wording: <em>Kismiṁ
vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>, “When what is not there, do touches not touch?”</p>
<p>The question, then, is not just the cessation of contact as such. The answer,
too, has the same peculiarity. <em>Rūpe vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>, “It is when
form is not there that touches do not touch”. It is the subsequent question
regarding form that brings out the cryptic verse as the answer.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that the verse in question alludes to a supramundane state
far transcending the formless or any supposed intermediate stage. The
transcendence of pleasure and pain, as well as perception of form, is implied
here.</p>
<p>The verse beginning with <em>na saññasaññī</em> brings the entire analytical
disquisition to a climax. It comes as the thirteenth verse in the series.
Usually, such a disquisition leads up to a climax, highlighting Nibbāna. It is
obvious, therefore, that the reference here is to the <em>Nibbānic</em> mind.</p>
<p>We have here four negations: <em>Na saññasaññī – na visaññasaññī – no pi asaññī –
na vibhūtasaññī.</em> These four negations insinuate a strange supramundane level of
perception. In short, it is an attempt to analyse the crux of the Dhamma in
terms of perception. As to the provocation for such an approach, we may remind
ourselves of the fact that, according to the Buddha, release from materiality
amounted to a release from the perception of form. Here, we have something
really deep.</p>
<p>As it was stated in the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em>, for the disentangling of the tangle,
name-and-form, resistance and perception of form, have to be cut off. This last
mentioned perception of form, or <em>rūpasaññā</em>, is highly significant.</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Buddha the general belief, even among ascetics, was
that, in order to be free from form, one has to attain to the formless, <em>arūpa</em>,
But, as we pointed out in an earlier sermon, this kind of approach to the
question of freedom from form, is like the attempt of one who, having imagined a
ghost in the darkness of the night, runs away to escape it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn387-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn387">11</a></sup> He is simply
taking the fantasy of the ghost with him.</p>
<p>Likewise, perception of form is already implicit in the formless. What has been
done is only a pushing away of the perception of form with the help of
<em>saṅkhāras</em>. It is merely a suppression of form through the power of absorption.
It does not amount to a cessation of the perception of form.</p>
<p>What, then, is the message the Buddha gave to the world regarding the
abandonment by way of eradication? He pointed out that freedom from form can be
won only by comprehending a certain deep normative principle behind perception.</p>
<p>Till then, one keeps on going round and round in <em>saṁsāra</em>. Even if one breaks
away from form to stay for aeons in formless realms, one swings back to form at
the end of that period. Why? Because the ghost of form still haunts the
formless. It is precisely because of this fact that pre-Buddhistic ascetics
could not free themselves from the round of existence.</p>
<p>The <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> as a whole, could be regarded as an extremely deep
analysis of the basis of the two views of existence and non-existence. Our
departure from the <em>Mahāniddesa</em> in regard to the interpretation of this
discourse might sometimes be called in question. But let the wise judge its
reasonableness on its own merits.</p>
<p>According to our interpretation so far, the thirteenth verse marks the climax of
the discourse, with its allusion to Nibbāna. This is obvious from the fourteenth
verse, in which the questioner confesses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ taṁ apucchimha akittayī no, aññaṁ taṁ pucchāma tad iṅgha brūhi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn388-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn388">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever we have asked you, that you have explained to us. Now we wish to ask
you something else, pray, give us an answer to that too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question now posed is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ettāvataggaṁ nu vadanti h’eke, yakkhassa suddhiṁ idha paṇḍitāse, udāhu aññam
pi vadanti etto?</em></p>
<p>Do some, who are reckoned as wise men here, declare the highest purity of the
soul with this much alone, or else do they posit something beyond this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interlocutor is trying to get the solution restated in terms of the two
views of existence and non-existence. The term <em>yakkha</em> is used in this context
in the sense of an individual soul.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn389-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn389">13</a></sup></p>
<p>It betrays an assumption based on a wrong view. The question concerns the purity
of the individual soul. The interlocutor wants to ascertain whether wise men in
the world declare this state as the highest purity of the soul, or whether they
go beyond this in postulating something more. Here is an attempt to get the
answer already given restated in terms of the soul theory, a sort of
anti-climax. The two concluding verses that follow, give the lie to this
presumptuous question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ettāvataggaṁ pi vadanti h’eke</em> <br />
<em>yakkhassa suddhiṁ idha paṇḍitāse,</em> <br />
<em>tesaṁ paneke samayaṁ vadanti</em> <br />
<em>anupādisese kusalā vadānā.</em></p>
<p>Some, who are regarded as wise men here, <br />
Call this itself the highest purity of the individual soul, <br />
But there are again some among them, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> who speak of an annihilation, <br />
Claiming to be experts in the cessation without residue.</p>
<p><em>Ete ca ñatvā upanissitā ti</em> <br />
<em>ñatvā munī nissaye so vimaṁsī,</em> <br />
<em>ñatvā vimutto na vivādam eti</em> <br />
<em>bhavābhavāya na sameti dhīro.</em></p>
<p>Knowing that they are dependent on speculative views, <br />
The sage with discernment, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> with regard to whatever is speculative, <br />
Emancipated as he is through understanding, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> does not enter into dispute, <br />
A truly wise man does not fall back either <br />
<span class="vin"></span> on existence or on non-existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concluding verse amounts to a refutation of both these extreme views. The
truly wise sage, who is released with proper discernment of the nature of
dogmatic involvement, has no disputes with those who are at loggerheads with
each other on the issue of existence and non-existence. This, in effect, means
that Nibbāna as a goal avoids both extremes of eternalism and nihilism.</p>
<p>The <em>Upasīvasutta</em> in the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> provides further
proof of the plausibility of the above interpretation. There, Nibbāna as the
cessation of consciousness in the <em>arahant</em>, is compared to the extinction of a
flame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accī yathā vātavegena khitto</em> <br />
<em>atthaṁ paleti na upeti saṅkhaṁ</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ munī nāmakāyā vimutto</em> <br />
<em>atthaṁ paleti na upeti saṅkhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn390-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn390">14</a></sup></p>
<p>As flame flung on by force of wind, <br />
Reaches its end, comes not within reckoning, <br />
So the sage, released from name-and-form, <br />
Reaches his end, comes not within reckoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a flame goes out, it cannot be reckoned as having gone in any of the
directions, like north, east, south, and west. All what can be said about it, is
that it has gone out.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn391-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn391">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Even after the Buddha has given this reply, the brahmin youth Upasīva,
entrenched as he is in the eternalist view, raises a question which is similar
to the one already quoted. He, too, is trying to understand it in terms of the
two extreme views of existence and non-existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthaṁgato so uda vā so natthi</em> <br />
<em>udāhu ve sassatiyā arogo,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ me munī sādhu viyākarohi,</em> <br />
<em>tathā hi te vidito esa dhammo.</em></p>
<p>Has he reached his end, or is he no more, <br />
Or is he eternally well, <br />
That to me, sage, in full explain, <br />
For this Dhamma is well within your ken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the discourses we find similar instances of attempts to determine, in terms
of those two extreme views, even a conclusive statement of the Buddha on the
question of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Yet another instance is found in the <em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em> of the <em>Dīghanikāya</em>.
There the Buddha outlines the path to Nibbāna from the point of view of
perception. The discourse, therefore, is one that highlights the importance of
the term <em>saññā</em>. In that discourse, the path of training leading to Nibbāna is
introduced under the heading</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn392-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn392">16</a></sup></p>
<p>the attainment, with full awareness, to the gradual cessation of higher levels
of perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is significant in this particular context, is that the invitation for this
exposition came from the ascetics of other sects. In response to their request
to enlighten them on the subject of the cessation of higher levels of
perception, <em>abhisaññānirodha</em>, the Buddha gave quite a long account of the
course of training required for it. But at the end of that deep exposition, the
wandering ascetic Poṭṭhapāda raises the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññā nu kho purisassa attā, udāhu aññā saññā aññā attā?</em></p>
<p>Is perception a man’s soul, or is perception something and soul another?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is typical of their bigotted attitude, which prevented them from
understanding this Dhamma, free from the soul prejudice.</p>
<p>We went so far as to bring out all this evidence, because the point at issue is
fairly important. Even the attempt of the <em>Mahāniddesa</em> to explain the verse
beginning with <em>na saññasaññī</em> is far from conclusive. It is not at all likely
that the ascetics of other sects subscribed to a view that the intermediate
stage between the fourth absorption and the first formless absorption is
equivalent to the purest state of the soul. Such an interim state is of no
account.</p>
<p>As we go on, we might come across further proof of the tenability of this
interpretation. The verse beginning with <em>na saññasaññī</em> is not easily
forgotten, because of its unusual accent on the negative particle.</p>
<p>We might have to hark back to it when we come across similar discourses dealing
with Nibbāna. Till then, let us remind ourselves of two similes we have already
given, in order to get a foretaste of the significance of this problematic
verse.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Buddha’s simile of the magic show as an illustration for
consciousness in the <em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamasutta</em> – <em>māyūpamañca viññāṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn393-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn393">17</a></sup>
While describing the five groups, he compares consciousness to a magical
performance at crossroads, conducted by a magician or his apprentice. A man with
the right type of vision, watching this magic show, understands that it is
empty, hollow and void of essence. It is as if he has seen through the tricks
and deceptions of the magician.</p>
<p>While watching a magic show, the audience in general reacts to it with gaping
mouths and exclamations. But how would a man with radical attention and
penetrative wisdom, who is fully aware of the tricks of the magician, watch a
magic show? He is simply looking on with a vacant gaze.</p>
<p>This reminds us of the significance of the word <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ anantaṁ
sabbato pabhaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn394-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn394">18</a></sup> That gaze is ‘endless’, <em>anantaṁ</em>, in the sense that it
does not have the magic show as its object. It goes beyond. It is also
‘non-manifestative’, <em>anidassanaṁ</em>, since the magic show does not manifest
itself, as it has now been penetrated through with wisdom. This wisdom is
revealing in its ‘all lustrous’ nature, <em>sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, so much so that the
tricks are seen-through.</p>
<p>So this man with discernment is watching with a vacant gaze. Now how would such
a person appear to one who is deluded and enchanted by the magic show? The
latter might regard the former as an inattentive spectator who misses the magic
show. Or else, he might think that the other is out of his senses, or insensate.</p>
<p>What the riddle verse beginning with <em>na saññasaññī</em> refers to, is such a vacant
gaze. That is to say, the person referred to is not one with the ordinary
worldling’s perception, which is deluded, nor has he fainted and become
unconscious, <em>na saññasaññī na visaññasaññī</em>. He is not in a trance, devoid of
perception, <em>no pi asaññī</em>, nor has he put and end to perception, <em>na
vibhūtasaññī</em>. What these four negations highlight, is that vacant gaze of the
one who is emancipated through wisdom.</p>
<p>Somewhat on the lines of the simile used by the Buddha, we might reintroduce, as
a flashback, the simile of the cinema.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn395-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn395">19</a></sup> Though it has a modernistic
flavour, it could perhaps be more easily understood. Let us suppose that a
matinee show of a technicolour film is in progress with closed doors and
windows. Suddenly, by some technical defect, the doors and windows are flung
open. What would be the change of perspective in the spectator now? He, too,
would be looking on with a vacant gaze. Though still the show is going on, he is
no longer seeing it. A sort of ‘cessation’ has occurred, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>The theme as well as the objective of all our sermons is expressed in the
quotation beginning with “This is peaceful, this is excellent” (etc.), which
forms the rubric, as it were, for each sermon. The change that occurs in the
spectator now, is somewhat reminiscent of it. Though not all preparations, at
least those preparations connected with the film show are momentarily ‘stilled’.
Whatever assets in the form of the bundle of experiences on which the film show
is evalued, are ‘relinquished’. The craving or the desire for the show has gone
down. The colourful show has ‘faded away’, making way for detachment. The film
show has ‘ceased’ for him. It is also extinct for him, since his burning desire
has cooled off now. In this way, we can understand the four puzzling negations
in that riddle verse as an attempt to describe the vacant gaze of this
spectator, and that man with discernment at the magic show.</p>
<p>Another aspect of special significance in this riddle verse emerges from the
last line, <em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā</em>, which could be tentatively rendered
as “for [whatever are termed] <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> have perception as their source”.</p>
<p><em>Papañca</em> is a term with a deep philosophical dimension in Buddhism. In fact,
even the rise of many Buddhist sects could be put down to an insufficient
appreciation of its significance. In our own philosophical tradition, too, much
of the confusion with regard to the interpretation of Nibbāna seems to have come
about due to a lack of understanding in this particular field. Therefore we
propose to devote sufficient time and attention to clarify the significance of
this term <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>To begin with, we can bring up clear evidence of the fact that the word
<em>papañca</em> is used in the discourses to convey some deep idea. As a rule,
whenever the Buddha presents a set of ideas pertaining to some Dhamma topic, the
deepest or the most important of them is mentioned last.</p>
<p>This feature is quite evident in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, where very often a
sermon is seen to unfold itself in an ascending order, leading to a climax. In
an enumeration of items ‘the last but not the least’, happens to be the most
important. Granted that this is the general trend, we can trace as many as nine
such contexts among the suttas in which <em>papañca</em> is counted last.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn396-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn396">20</a></sup> This
itself is a clue to its importance.</p>
<p>One of the most telling instances is to be found in the Eights of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>. It is called <em>Anuruddhamahāvitakkasutta</em>. There we are told that to
Venerable Anuruddha, once meditating in solitude in Pācīnavaṁsa Park, the
following seven thoughts occurred, concerning Dhamma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Appicchassāyaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo mahicchassa; santuṭṭhassāyaṁ dhammo,
nāyaṁ dhammo asantuṭṭhassa; pavivittassāyaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo
saṅgaṇikārāmassa; āraddhaviriyassāyaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo kusītassa;
upaṭṭithasatissāyaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo muṭṭhassatissa; samāhitassāyaṁ
dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo asamāhitassa; paññavato ayaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo
duppaññassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn397-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn397">21</a></sup></p>
<p>This Dhamma is for one who wants little, not for one who wants much; this
Dhamma is for one who is contented, not for one who is discontent; this Dhamma
is for one who is secluded, not for one who is fond of society; this Dhamma is
for the energetic, not for one who is lazy; this Dhamma is for one who has set
up mindfulness, not for one who is laggard in mindfulness; this Dhamma is for
one who is composed, not for one who is flustered; this Dhamma is for one who
is wise, not for one who is unwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When these seven thoughts occurred to him, Venerable Anuruddha kept on pondering
over them for a long while, probably with some Dhamma zest. He might have even
felt confident that this is a perfect set of Dhamma thoughts, since the number
is seven and wisdom comes last.</p>
<p>However, the Buddha was monitoring his behaviour of mind from Bhesakaḷāvanae,
many leagues away, and found that this set of seven is far from complete. So he
appeared before Venerable Anuruddha through his psychic power and, having first
commended Venerable Anuruddha for those seven thoughts, calling them ‘thoughts
of a great man’, <em>mahāpurisavitakka</em>, gave him an eighth to add on to them and
ponder upon. The eighth thought of a great man is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nippapañcārāmassāyaṁ Dhammo nippapañcaratino, nāyaṁ Dhammo papañcārāmassa
papañcaratino</em>.</p>
<p>This Dhamma is for one who likes and delights in <em>nippapañca</em> and not for one
who likes and delights in <em>papañca</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the Buddha’s instructions in this concern, Venerable Anuruddha
attained <em>arahanthood</em>, and uttered two verses as a paean of joy. From the two
verses it becomes clear that the Buddha’s helpful hint regarding <em>nippapañca</em> –
whatever it may mean – was what triggered off his attainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā me ahu saṅkappo,</em> <br />
<em>tato uttari desayi,</em> <br />
<em>nippapañcarato Buddho,</em> <br />
<em>nippapañcaṁ adesayi.</em></p>
<p><em>Tassāhaṁ Dhamma maññāya,</em> <br />
<em>vihāsiṁ sāsane rato,</em> <br />
<em>tisso vijjā anuppattā,</em> <br />
<em>kataṁ Buddhassa sāsanaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn398-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn398">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever thoughts I had on my own, <br />
Going far beyond them the Lord preached to me, <br />
The Buddha, who delights in <em>nippapañca</em>, <br />
Preached <em>nippapañca</em> to me.</p>
<p>Understanding his Dhamma, <br />
I dwelt delighting in his admonishment, <br />
The three knowledges are attained, <br />
Done is the Buddha’s behest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words of Venerable Anuruddha clearly reveal the immense significance
attached to the term <em>papañca</em> and its relevance to the question of attaining
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that a number of suttas like <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>,
<em>Sakkapañhasutta</em>, <em>Cūḷasīhanādasutta</em>, and <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> give prominence
to the term <em>papañca</em> by listing it as the last.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn399-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn399">23</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most important discourses throwing light on the significance of this
term <em>papañca</em> is the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. We shall
therefore proceed to discuss this particular sutta at some length.</p>
<p>The <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> is in fact a discourse that unfolds itself in three
stages, like a three act play. It might not be inapt to say something about the
title of this discourse by way of introduction, before we get down to an
analysis of it. At the conclusion of the discourse, Venerable Ānanda makes the
following comment on its significance before the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, just as if a man overcome by hunger and exhaustion came upon a
honey-ball, and, from whatever side he goes on licking it, he would get a
sweet delectable flavour which remains unimpaired, so too, Lord, any nimble
witted monk, from whatever angle he examines with wisdom the meaning of this
discourse on the Dhamma, he would find satisfaction and gladness of mind. What
is the name of this discourse, Lord?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn400-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn400">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was then that the Buddha gave this name to the discourse, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, then, Ānanda, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as the
‘honey-ball discourse’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might not have the ability to assimilate fully the flavour of this discourse,
and in any case we might not even have sufficient time for it today. However, if
we are to make a start, we may begin with the first act, that is, where we find
the Buddha spending his noon-day siesta at Mahāvana in Kapilavatthu. The Sakyan
Daṇḍapāṇi, so called because he used to carry a staff in hand, comes to see the
Buddha and puts the following short question to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁvādī samaṇo kimakkhāyi?</em></p>
<p>What does the recluse assert, what does he proclaim?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s reply to it is rather long and winding, so much so that it is not
easy to render it clear enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathāvādi kho, āvuso, sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā
pajāya sadevamanussāya na kenaci loke viggayha tiṭṭhati, yathā ca pana kāmehi
visaṁyuttaṁ viharantaṁ taṁ brāhmaṇaṁ akathaṁkathiṁ chinnakukkuccaṁ bhavābhave
vītataṇhaṁ saññā nānusenti, evaṁvādī kho ahaṁ, āvuso, evamakkhāyī.</em></p>
<p>According to whatever doctrine, friend, one does not quarrel with anyone in
the world with its gods, its Māras and Brahmas, with the progeny of the world
comprising recluses and brahmins, gods and men, and also due to which
perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sense
pleasures, without perplexity, remorse cut off and devoid of craving for any
kind of existence, such is my doctrine, friend, thus do I proclaim it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be noted that the word brahmin in this context refers to the <em>arahant</em>.
The reply, winding as it is, goes deeper in its insinuations, touching the
presumptions of the questioner. That is to say, generally, in the world, if
anyone proclaims a doctrine, it is natural that it will come into conflict with
other doctrines.</p>
<p>Also, in proclaiming that doctrine one has to have latent perceptions relating
to it. The Buddha’s reply, however, seems to contradict these presumptions. In a
nutshell, the reply amounts to this:</p>
<p>Firstly, the Buddha’s teaching is such that he does not come into conflict with
others. Secondly, perceptions do not lie latent in him.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the term <em>saññā</em>, perception, in this context, is also
significant. We have already stressed the importance of this term. Perceptions
do not lie latent in the Buddha or in the doctrine propounded by him.</p>
<p>Daṇḍapāṇi’s response to this reply of the Buddha is also recorded in the sutta.
It is dramatic enough to substantiate our comparison of the discourse to a
three-act play. Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, wagged his tongue, raised his eyebrows
into a three-lined frown on his forehead and departed, leaning on his stick. The
Buddha’s reply did not arouse any faith in him.</p>
<p>In the next act we find the Buddha seated in the company of the monks in the
evening and telling them of his brief encounter with Daṇḍapāṇi. Then one of the
monks requested an explanation of the enigmatic reply the Buddha had given to
Daṇḍapāṇi. The Buddha’s explanation, however, took the form of an even longer
statement, no less enigmatic than the former. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yatonidānaṁ, bhikkhu, purisaṁ papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti, ettha ce
natthi abhinanditabbaṁ abhivaditabbaṁ ajjhosetabbaṁ, esevanto rāgānusayānaṁ,
esevanto paṭighānusayānaṁ, esevanto diṭṭhānusayānaṁ, esevanto
vicikicchānusayānaṁ, esevanto mānānusayānaṁ, esevanto bhavarāgānusayānaṁ,
esevanto avijjānusayānaṁ, esevanto
daṇḍādāna-satthādāna-kalaha-viggaha-vivāda-tuvaṁtuvaṁ-pesuñña-musāvādānaṁ,
etthete pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti.</em></p>
<p>From whatever source <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> beset a man, if, in regard to that,
there is nothing to be delighted in, asserted, or clung to, then this itself
is the end of the underlying tendencies to attachment, to aversion, to views,
to doubts, to conceit, to attachment towards existence, and to ignorance. This
itself is the end of taking rods and weapons, quarrels, disputes, accusations,
slander and false speech. Here these evil unskilful states cease without
remainder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After making such a long and winding statement, the Buddha rose from his seat
and went into his dwelling, as if it were the end of the second act. One can
well imagine the consternation of the monks at this dramatic turn of events. The
explanation looked even more astounding than the original statement, because of
its elliptical character. So here is a case of a puzzle within a puzzle. It is
the first few words that are most puzzling.</p>
<p>Naturally, the monks were so perplexed that they decided to approach Venerable
Mahā Kaccāna and request him to give them a detailed exposition of the Buddha’s
words, as he had been praised by the Buddha for his skill in this respect.</p>
<p>When they went to him and made the request, Venerable Mahā Kaccāna showed some
modest hesitation at first, but finally agreed to it. Now we come to the third
act, in which Venerable Mahā Kaccāna is giving the exposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati
phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, yaṁ vedeti taṁ sañjānāti, yaṁ sañjānāti taṁ
vitakketi, yaṁ vitakketi taṁ papañceti, yaṁ papañceti tatonidānaṁ purisaṁ
papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti atītānāgatapaccuppannesu cakkhuviññeyyesu
rūpesu.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only with regard to eye and forms, but also with reference to all the other
sense-faculties, including the mind, together with their respective
sense-objects, a similar statement is made. Suffice it to translate the one
quoted above as a paradigm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dependent on the eye and forms, brethren, arises eye-consciousness; the
concurrence of the three is contact; because of contact, feeling; what one
feels, one perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one reasons
about, one turns into <em>papañca</em>; what one turns into <em>papañca</em>, owing to that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<em>tatonidānaṁ,</em> which is the correlative of <em>yatonidānaṁ</em> forming the key word
in the Buddha’s brief summary above)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> beset him who directed his powers of sense-perception.
They overwhelm him and subjugate him in respect of forms cognizable by the eye
belonging to the past, the future and the present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the same with regard to the ear and sounds and the rest. Lastly, even
about mind and mind-objects Venerable Mahā Kaccāna makes a similar statement.</p>
<p>At this point, we are forced to say something about the commentarial explanation
of this particular passage. It seems that the commentarial exegesis has failed
to bring out the deeper implications of the term <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>. The main
reason for the confusion is the lack of attention on the part of the commentator
to the peculiar syntax of the formula in question.</p>
<p>The formula begins on an impersonal note,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>paṭicca</em> is reminiscent of the law of dependent arising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati phasso,</em></p>
<p>the concurrence of the three is contact.</p>
<p><em>Phassapaccayā vedanā,</em></p>
<p>conditioned by contact is feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From here onwards the formula takes a different turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ vedeti taṁ sañjānāti, yaṁ sañjānāti taṁ vitakketi, yaṁ vitakketi taṁ
papañceti,</em></p>
<p>what one feels, one perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one
reasons about, one turns into <em>papañca</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, we can distinguish three phases in this description of the process
of sense perception in Venerable Mahā Kaccāna’s exposition. It begins with an
impersonal note, but at the point of feeling it takes on a personal ending,
suggestive of deliberate activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ vedeti taṁ sañjānāti, yaṁ sañjānāti taṁ vitakketi, yaṁ vitakketi taṁ
papañceti,</em></p>
<p>what one feels, one perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one
reasons about, one turns into <em>papañca</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we render the formula in this way, the commentary explains it
differently. It ignores the significance of the personal ending and interprets
the sensory process periphrastically, for example as <em>saññā sañjānāti, vitakko
vitakketi</em>, ‘perception perceives’, ‘reasoning reasons about’, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn401-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn401">25</a></sup> It
amounts to saying that, when feeling occurs, perception comes forward and
perceives it, then reasoning takes up the task of reasoning about perception.
<em>Papañca</em> then steps in and converts that reasoning into <em>papañca</em>. This is how
the commentary explains that formula. It has left out of account the
significance of the use of the active voice in this section of the formula.</p>
<p>There is a special purpose in using the active voice in this context. It is in
order to explain how a man is overwhelmed by <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> – whatever it
may be – that Venerable Mahā Kaccāna has introduced this sequence of events in
three phases.</p>
<p>In fact, he is trying to fill in the gap in the rather elliptical statement of
the Buddha, beginning with <em>yatonidānaṁ, bhikkhu, purisaṁ papañcasaññāsaṅkhā
samudācaranti,</em> “monk, from whatever source <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> beset a man”.
The initial phase is impersonal, but then comes the phase of active
participation.</p>
<p>From feeling onwards, the person behind it takes over. What one feels, one
perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one reasons about, one
turns into <em>papañca</em>. The grossest phase is the third.</p>
<p>Venerable Mahā Kaccāna’s formula shows how the process of sense-perception
gradually assumes a gross form. This third phase is implicit in the words <em>yaṁ
papañceti tatonidānaṁ purisaṁ papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti</em>, “what one turns
into <em>papañca</em>, owing to that <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> beset that man”.</p>
<p>The word <em>purisaṁ</em> is in the accusative case here, implying that the person who
directed sense-perception is now beset with, or overwhelmed by,
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, as a result of which all the evil unskilful mental states
come to be. This itself is an index to the importance of the term <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>The course of events suggested by these three phases may be illustrated with the
legend of the three magicians. While journeying through a forest, three men,
skilled in magic, came upon a scattered heap of bones of a tiger. To display
their skill, one of them converted the bones into a complete skeleton, the
second gave it flesh and blood, and the third gave it life. The resurrected
tiger devoured all three of them. It is such a predicament that is hinted at by
the peculiar syntax of the formula in question.</p>
<p>The comparison of this discourse to a honey-ball is understandable, since it
holds the secret of the latent tendencies towards dogmatic views. It also
affords a deep insight into the nature of the linguistic medium, and words and
concepts in everyday usage.</p>
<p>We haven’t yet clarified the meaning of the term <em>papañca</em>. It is already found
in common parlance as a word suggestive of verbosity and circumlocution.</p>
<p>Etymologically, it is traceable to <em>pra + √pañc</em>, and it conveys such meanings
as ‘spreading out’, ‘expansion’, ‘diffuseness’ and ‘manifoldness’. Verbosity and
circumlocution usually lead to delusion and confusion.</p>
<p>However, the word <em>papañca</em> is sometimes used to denote a conscious elaboration
of what is already expressed in brief. In this particular sense, the cognate
term <em>vipañcitaññū</em> is used in the context of four types of persons,
distinguished according to their levels of understanding, namely <em>ugghaṭitaññū,
vipañcitaññū, neyyo,</em> and <em>padaparamo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn402-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn402">26</a></sup> Here, <em>vipañcitaññū</em> signifies
that sort of person to whom comprehension of the doctrine comes when the meaning
of what is uttered in brief is analysed in detail.</p>
<p>All in all, <em>papañca</em> in linguistic usage has the insinuation of a certain
degree of delusion brought about by verbosity and circumlocution. But here the
term has a deeper philosophical dimension. Here it is not a case of linguistic
usage, but the behaviour of the mind as such, since it concerns
sense-perception.</p>
<p>The fact that it follows in the wake of <em>vitakka</em> is suggestive of its affinity
to <em>vicāra</em>, or discursive thought, so often quoted as the twin of <em>vitakka</em>,
that is as <em>vitakkavicāra</em>.</p>
<p>The mind has the tendency to wander afar, all alone, <em>dūraṅgamaṁ
ekacaraṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn403-1"><a href="sermon-11.html#fn-fn403">27</a></sup> through the medium of thought, or <em>vitakka</em>. When <em>vitakka</em>
breaks loose and runs riot, it creates a certain deluded state of mind, which is
<em>papañca</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>This is the twelfth sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna. At the beginning
of our last sermon, we brought up the two terms <em>papañca</em> and <em>nippapañca</em>,
which help us rediscover quite a deep dimension in Buddhist philosophy, hidden
under the sense of time. In our attempt to clarify the meaning of these two
terms, initially with the help of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>, what we could
determine so far is the fact that <em>papañca</em> signifies a certain gross state in
sense-perception.</p>
<p>Though in ordinary linguistic usage <em>papañca</em> meant ‘elaboration’,
‘circumlocution’, and ‘verbosity’, the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> has shown us that in
the context of sensory perception it has some special significance. It portrays
how a person, who directed sense perception, is overwhelmed by
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> with regard to sense-objects relating to the three periods
of time, past, present, and future, as a result of his indulging in <em>papañca</em>
based on reasoning about percepts.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that <em>papañca</em> has connotations of some kind of delusion,
obsession, and confusion arising in a man’s mind due to sense perception.</p>
<p>In explaining the meaning of this term, commentators very often make use of
words like <em>pamatta</em>, ‘excessively intoxicated’, ‘indolent’, <em>pamāda</em>,
‘headlessness’, and <em>madana</em>, ‘intoxication’. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kenaṭṭhena papañco? Mattapamattākārapāpanaṭṭhena papañco</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn405-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn405">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Papañca</em> in what sense? In the sense that it leads one on to a state of
intoxication and indolence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is commented on as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>papañcitā ca honti pamattākārapattā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn406-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn406">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They are subject to <em>papañca</em>, that is, they become more or less inebriated or
indolent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or else it is explained as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>madanākārasaṇṭhito kilesapapañco.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn407-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn407">4</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Papañca</em> of a defiling nature which is of an inebriating character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, <em>papañca</em> looks like a term similar in sense to <em>pamāda</em>,
indolence, heedlessness. But there is a subtle difference in meaning between
them.</p>
<p><em>Pamāda</em>, even etymologically, conveys the basic idea of ‘excessive
intoxication’. It has a nuance of inactivity or inefficiency, due to
intoxication. The outcome of such a state of affairs is either negligence or
heedlessness.</p>
<p>But as we have already pointed out, <em>papañca</em> has an etymological background
suggestive of expansion, elaboration, verbosity and circumlocution. Therefore,
it has no connotations of inactivity and inefficiency. On the other hand, it
seems to imply an inability to reach the goal due to a deviation from the
correct path.</p>
<p>Let us try to understand the distinction in meaning between <em>pamāda</em> and
<em>papañca</em> with the help of an illustration. Suppose we ask someone to go on an
urgent errant to Colombo. If instead of going to Colombo, he goes to the nearest
tavern and gets drunk and sleeps there – that is a case of <em>pamāda</em>. If, on the
other hand, he takes to a long labyrinthine road, avoiding the shortest cut to
Colombo, and finally reaches Kandy instead of Colombo – that is <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>There is such a subtle difference in the nuances associated with these two
terms. Incidentally, there is a couplet among the Sixes of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>, which sounds like a distant echo of the illustration we have already
given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo papañcam anuyutto</em> <br />
<em>papañcābhirato mago,</em> <br />
<em>virādhayī so Nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yogakkhemaṁ anuttaraṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Yo ca papañcaṁ hitvāna,</em> <br />
<em>nippapañca pade rato,</em> <br />
<em>ārādhayī so Nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yogakkhemaṁ anuttaraṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn408-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn408">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The fool who indulges in <em>papañca</em>, <br />
Being excessively fond of it, <br />
Has missed the way to Nibbāna, <br />
The incomparable freedom from bondage.</p>
<p>He who, having given up <em>papañca</em>, <br />
delights in the path to <em>nippapañca</em>, <br />
Is well on the way to Nibbāna, <br />
The incomparable freedom from bondage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way we can understand the difference between the two words <em>papañca</em> and
<em>pamāda</em> in respect of the nuances associated with them.</p>
<p>Commentaries very often explain the term <em>papañca</em> simply as a synonym of
craving, conceit, and views, <em>taṇhādiṭṭhimānānam etaṁ adhivacanaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn409-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn409">6</a></sup> But
this does not amount to a definition of <em>papañca</em> as such. It is true that these
are instances of <em>papañca,</em> for even in the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> we came across
the three expressions <em>abhinanditabbaṁ, abhivaditabbaṁ,</em> and <em>ajjhositabbaṁ</em>,
suggestive of them.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn410-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn410">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Abhinanditabbaṁ</em> means ‘what is worth delighting in’, <em>abhivaditabbaṁ</em> means
‘what is worth asserting’, <em>ajjhositabbaṁ</em> means ‘what is worth clinging on to’.
These three expressions are very often used in the discourses to denote the
three defilements craving, conceit and views.</p>
<p>That is to say, ‘delighting in’ by way of craving with the thought ‘this is
mine’; ‘asserting’ by way of conceit with the thought ‘this am I’; and ‘clinging
on to’ with the dogmatic view ‘this is my soul’.</p>
<p>Therefore the commentarial exegesis on <em>papañca</em> in terms of craving, conceit
and views is to a great extent justifiable. However, what is particularly
significant about the term <em>papañca</em> is that it conveys the sense of
proliferation and complexity of thought, on the lines of those three basic
tendencies. That is why the person concerned is said to be ‘overwhelmed by
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn411-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn411">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Here we need to clarify for ourselves the meaning of the word <em>saṅkhā.</em>
According to the commentary, it means ‘parts’, <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā’ti ettha
saṅkhā’ti koṭṭhāso,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn412-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn412">9</a></sup> “‘<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>’, herein ‘<em>saṅkhā</em>’ means
parts”. In that case <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> could be rendered as ‘parts of <em>papañca</em>’,
which says nothing significant about <em>saṅkhā</em> itself. On the other hand, if one
carefully examines the contexts in which the terms <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> and
<em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> are used in the discourses, one gets the impression that
<em>saṅkhā</em> means something deeper than ‘part’ or ‘portion’.</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhā, samaññā</em> and <em>paññatti</em> are more or less synonymous terms. Out of them,
<em>paññatti</em> is fairly well known as a term for ‘designation’.</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhā</em> and <em>samaññā</em> are associated in sense with <em>paññatti</em>. <em>Saṅkhā</em> means
‘reckoning’ and <em>samaññā</em> is ‘appellation’. These three terms are often used in
connection with worldly usage.</p>
<p>We come across quite a significant reference, relevant to this question of
<em>papañca</em>, in the <em>Niruttipathasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya.</em> It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tayome, bhikkhave, niruttipathā, adhivacanapathā, paññattipathā asaṅkiṇṇā
asaṅkiṇṇapubbā, na saṅkīyanti, na saṅkīyissanti, appaṭikuṭṭhā samaṇehi
brāhmaṇehi viññūhi. Katame tayo? Yaṁ, bhikkhave, rūpaṁ atītaṁ niruddhaṁ
vipariṇataṁ ’ahosī’ti tassa saṅkhā, ’ahosī’ti tassa samaññā, ’ahosī’ti tassa
paññatti, na tassa saṅkhā ’atthī’ti, na tassa saṅkhā ’bhavissatī’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn413-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn413">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three pathways of linguistic usage, of synonyms and of
designation, that are not mixed up, have never been mixed up, that are not
doubted and will not be doubted, and are undespised by intelligent recluses
and brahmins. What are the three? Whatever form, monks, that is past, ceased,
transformed, ‘it was’ is the reckoning for it, ‘it was’ is its appellation,
‘it was’ is its designation, it is not reckoned as ‘it is’, it is not reckoned
as ‘it will be’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The burden of this discourse, as it proceeds in this way, is the maxim that the
three periods of time should never be mixed up or confounded. For instance, with
regard to that form that is past, a verb in the past tense is used. One must not
imagine what is past to be existing as something present. Nor should one imagine
whatever belongs to the future as already existing in the present.</p>
<p>Whatever has been, is past. Whatever is, is present. It is a common mistake to
conceive of something that is yet to come as something already present, and to
imagine whatever is past also as present. This is the confusion the world is in.
That is why those recluses and brahmins, who are wise, do not mix them up.</p>
<p>Just as the above quoted paragraph speaks of whatever is past, so the discourse
continues to make similar statements with regard to whatever is present or
future. It touches upon all the five aggregates, for instance, whatever form
that is present is reckoned as ‘it is’, and not as ‘it was’ or ‘it will be’.
Similarly, whatever form that is yet to come is reckoned as ‘it will be’, and
not as ‘it was’ or ‘it is’. This is how the <em>Niruttipathasutta</em> lays down the
basic principle of not confounding the linguistic usages pertaining to the three
periods of time.</p>
<p>Throughout this discourse, the term <em>saṅkhā</em> is used in the sense of
‘reckoning’. In fact, the three terms <em>saṅkhā, samaññā</em> and <em>paññatti</em> are used
somewhat synonymously in the same way as <em>nirutti, adhivacana</em> and <em>paññatti</em>.
All these are in sense akin to each other in so far as they represent the
problem of worldly usage.</p>
<p>This makes it clear that the intriguing term <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> has a
relevance to the question of language and modes of linguistic usages. The term
could thus be rendered as ‘reckonings born of prolific perceptions’.</p>
<p>If we are to go deeper into the significance of the term <em>saṅkhā</em>, we may say
that its basic sense in linguistic usage is connected with numerals, since it
means ‘reckoning’. As a matter of fact, numerals are more primitive than
letters, in a language.</p>
<p>To perceive is to grasp a sign of permanence in something. Perception has the
characteristic of grasping a sign. It is with the help of signs that one
recognizes. Perceptions of forms, perceptions of sounds, perceptions of smells,
perceptions of tastes, etc., are so many ways of grasping signs.</p>
<p>Just as a party going through a forest would blaze a trail with an axe in order
to find their way back with the help of notches on the trees, so does perception
catch a sign in order to be able to recognize.</p>
<p>This perception is like the groping of a blind man, fumbling in the dark. There
is a tendency in the mind to grasp a sign after whatever is felt. So it gives
rise to perceptions of forms, perceptions of sounds, etc. A sign necessarily
involves the notion of permanence. That is to say, a sign stands for permanence.
A sign has to remain unchanged until one returns to it to recognize it. That is
also the secret behind the mirage nature of perception as a whole.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn414-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn414">11</a></sup></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the word <em>saññā</em>, used to denote perception as such,
primarily means the ‘sign’, ‘symbol’, or ‘mark’, with which one recognizes. But
recognition alone is not enough. What is recognized has to be made known to the
world, to the society at large. That is why <em>saññā</em>, or perception, is followed
by <em>saṅkhā</em>, or reckoning.</p>
<p>The relationship between <em>saṅkhā, samaññā</em> and <em>paññatti</em> in this connection
could also be explained. <em>Saṅkhā</em> as ‘reckoning’ or ‘counting’ totals up or adds
up into groups of, say, five or six. It facilitates our work, particularly in
common or communal activities. So the most primitive symbol in a language is the
numeral.</p>
<p><em>Samaññā</em>, or appellation, is a common agreement as to how something should be
known. If everyone had its own may of making known, exchange of ideas would be
impossible. <em>Paññatti</em>, or designation, determines the pattern of whatever is
commonly agreed upon. This way we can understand the affinity of meaning between
the terms <em>saṅkhā, samaññā</em> and <em>paññatti</em>.</p>
<p>Among them, <em>saṅkhā</em> is the most primitive form of reckoning. It does not simply
mean reckoning or adding up in terms of numerals. It is characteristic of
language too, as we may infer from the occurrence of the expression <em>saṅkhaṁ
gacchati</em> in many discourses. There the reckoning meant is a particular
linguistic usage. We come across a good illustration of such a linguistic usage
in the <em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em>, where Venerable Sāriputta is addressing his
fellow monks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, āvuso, kaṭṭhañca paṭicca valliñca paṭicca tiṇañca paṭicca
mattikañca paṭicca ākāso parivārito agāraṁ tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati; evameva
kho, āvuso, aṭṭhiñca paṭicca nahāruñca paṭicca maṁsañca paṭicca cammañca
paṭicca ākāso parivārito rūpaṁ tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn415-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn415">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Friends, just as when space is enclosed by timber and creepers, grass and
clay, it comes to be reckoned as ‘a house’; even so, when space is enclosed by
bones and sinews, flesh and skin, it comes to be reckoned as ‘material form’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the expression <em>saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em> stands for a designation as a concept. It
is the way something comes to be known.</p>
<p>Let us go for another illustration from a sermon by the Buddha himself. It is
one that throws a flood of light on some deep aspects of Buddhist philosophy,
relating to language, grammar and logic. It comes in the <em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em> of
the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>, where the Buddha is exhorting Citta Hatthisāriputta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, Citta, gavā khīraṁ, khīramhā dadhi, dadhimhā navanītaṁ,
navanītamhā sappi, sappimhā sappimaṇḍo. Yasmiṁ samaye khīraṁ hoti, neva
tasmiṁ samaye dadhī’ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na navanītan’ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na
sappī’ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na sappimaṇḍo’ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, khīraṁ tveva
tasmiṁ samaye saṅkhaṁ gacchati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn416-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn416">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Just, Citta, as from a cow comes milk, and from milk curds, and from curds
butter, and from butter ghee, and from ghee junket. But when it is milk, it is
not reckoned as curd or butter or ghee or junket, it is then simply reckoned
as milk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We shall break up the relevant quotation into three parts, for facility of
comment. This is the first part giving the introductory simile. The simile
itself looks simple enough, though it is suggestive of something deep. The
simile is in fact extended to each of the other stages of milk formation, namely
curd, butter, ghee, and junket, pointing out that in each case, it is not
reckoned otherwise. Now comes the corresponding doctrinal point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evameva kho, Citta, yasmiṁ samaye oḷāriko attapaṭilābho hoti, neva tasmiṁ
samaye manomayo attapaṭilābho’ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na arūpo attapaṭilābho’ti
saṅkhaṁ gacchati, oḷāriko attapaṭilābho tveva tasmiṁ samaye saṅkhaṁ gacchati.</em></p>
<p>Just so, Citta, when the gross mode of personality is going on, it is not
reckoned as ‘the mental mode of personality’, nor as ‘the formless mode of
personality’, it is then simply reckoned as ‘the gross mode of personality’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three modes of personality correspond to the three planes of existence,
the sensuous, the form, and the formless. The first refers to the ordinary
physical frame, sustained by material food, <em>kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho</em>, enjoying
the sense pleasures.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn417-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn417">14</a></sup> At the time a person is in this sensual field,
possessing the gross mode of personality, one must not imagine that the mental
mode or the formless mode of personality is hidden in him.</p>
<p>This is the type of confusion the ascetics entrenched in a soul theory fell
into. They even conceived of self as fivefold, encased in concentric shells.
Whereas in the <em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em> one comes across the <em>pañcakośa</em> theory,
the reference here is to three states of the self, as gross, mental and formless
modes of personality. Out of the five selves known to <em>Upaniṣadic</em> philosophy,
namely <em>annamaya, prāṇamaya, saṁjñāmaya, vijñāṇamaya</em> and <em>ānandamaya</em>, only
three are mentioned here, in some form or other. The gross mode of personality
corresponds to <em>annamayātman</em>, the mental mode of personality is equivalent to
<em>saṁjñāmayātman</em>, while the formless mode of personality stands for
<em>vijñāṇamayātman</em>.</p>
<p>The correct perspective of understanding this distinction is provided by the
milk simile. Suppose someone gets a <em>jhāna</em> and attains to a mental mode of
personality. He should not imagine that the formless mode of personality is
already latent in him. Nor should he think that the former gross mode of
personality is still lingering in him. They are just temporary states, to be
distinguished like milk and curd. This is the moral the Buddha is trying to
drive home.</p>
<p>Now we come to the third part of the quotation, giving the Buddha’s conclusion,
which is extremely important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imā kho, Citta, lokasamaññā lokaniruttiyo lokavohārā lokapaññattiyo, yāhi
Tathāgato voharati aparāmasaṁ.</em></p>
<p>For all these, Citta, are worldly apparitions, worldly expressions, worldly
usages, worldly designations, which the Tathāgata makes use of without
tenacious grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the last word in the quotation, <em>aparāmasaṁ,</em> which is extremely
important. There is no tenacious grasping. The Buddha uses the language much in
the same way as parents make use of a child’s homely prattle, for purpose of
meditation.</p>
<p>He had to present this Dhamma, which goes against the current,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn418-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn418">15</a></sup> through
the medium of worldly language, with which the worldlings have their transaction
in defilements. That is probably the reason why the Buddha at first hesitated to
preach this Dhamma. He must have wondered how he can convey such a deep Dhamma
through the terminology, the grammar and the logic of worldlings.</p>
<p>All this shows the immense importance of the <em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em>. If the ordinary
worldling presumes that ghee is already inherent in the milk obtained from the
cow, he will try to argue it out on the grounds that after all it is milk that
becomes ghee. And once it becomes ghee, he might imagine that milk is still to
be found in ghee, in some latent form.</p>
<p>As a general statement, this might sound ridiculous. But even great philosophers
were unaware of the implications of their theories. That is why the Buddha had
to come out with this homely milk simile, to bring them to their senses. Here
lies the secret of the soul theory. It carried with it the implication that past
and future also exist in the same sense as the present.</p>
<p>The Buddha, on the other hand, uses the verb <em>atthi</em>, ‘is’, only for what exists
in the present. He points out that, whatever is past, should be referred to as
<em>ahosi</em>, ‘was’, and whatever is yet to come, in the future, should be spoken of
as <em>bhavissati</em>, ‘will be’. This is the fundamental principle underlying the
<em>Niruttipathasutta</em> already quoted. Any departure from it would give rise to
such confusions as referred to above.</p>
<p>Milk, curd, butter and ghee are merely so many stages in a certain process. The
worldlings, however, have put them into watertight compartments, by designating
and circumscribing them. They are caught up in the conceptual trap of their own
making.</p>
<p>When the philosophers started working out the logical relationship between cause
and effect, they tended to regard these two as totally unrelated to each other.
Since milk becomes curd, either the two are totally different from each other,
or curd must already be latent in milk for it to become curd. This is the kind
of dilemma their logic posed for them.</p>
<p>Indian philosophical systems reflect a tendency towards such logical subtleties.
They ended up with various extreme views concerning the relation between cause
and effect. In a certain school of Indian philosophy, known as <em>ārambhavāda</em>,
effect is explained as something totally new, unrelated to the cause. Other
schools of philosophy, such as <em>satkāriyavāda</em> and <em>satkaraṇavāda</em>, also arose
by confusing this issue. For them, effect is already found hidden in the cause,
before it comes out. Yet others took only the cause as real. Such extreme
conclusions were the result of forgetting the fact that all these are mere
concepts in worldly usage. Here we have a case of getting caught up in a
conceptual trap of one’s own making.</p>
<p>This confusion regarding the three periods of time, characteristic of such
philosophers, could be illustrated with some folk tales and fables, which
lucidly bring out a deep truth.</p>
<p>There is, for instance, the tale of the goose that lays golden eggs, well known
to the West. A certain goose used to lay a golden egg every day. Its owner, out
of excessive greed, thought of getting all the as yet ones. He killed the goose
and opened it up, only to come to grief. He had wrongly imagined the future to
be already existing in the present.</p>
<p>This is the kind of blunder the soul theorists also committed. In the field of
philosophy, too, the prolific tendency led to such subtle complications. It is
not much different from the proliferations indulged in by the ordinary worldling
in his daily life. That is why reckonings born of prolific perception are said
to be so overwhelming. One is overwhelmed by one’s own reckonings and figurings
out, under the influence of prolific perceptions.</p>
<p>An Indian poet once spotted a ruby, shining in the moon light, and eagerly
approached it, enchanted by it, only to find a blood red spittle of beetle. We
often come across such humorous stories in literature, showing the pitfalls of
prolific conceptualisation.</p>
<p>The introductory story, leading up to the <em>Dhammapada</em> verse on the rambling
nature of the mind, <em>dūraṅgamaṁ ekacaraṁ, asarīraṁ guhāsayaṁ</em>, as recorded in
the commentary to the <em>Dhammapada,</em> is very illustrative.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn419-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn419">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The pupil of venerable Saṅgharakkhita Thera, a nephew of his, indulged in a
<em>papañca</em> while fanning his teacher. In his imagination, he disrobed, got
married, had a child, and was coming in a chariot with his wife and child to see
his former teacher. The wife, through carelessness, dropped the child and the
chariot run away. So he whipped his wife in a fit of anger, only to realize that
he had dealt a blow on his teacher’s head with the fan still in his hand. Being
an <em>arahant</em> with psychic powers, his teacher immediately understood the pupil’s
state of mind, much to the latter’s discomfiture.</p>
<p>A potter in Sanskrit literature smashed his pots in a sort of business <em>papañca</em>
and was remorseful afterwards. Similarly the proud milk maid in English
literature dropped a bucket of milk on her head in a day dream of her rosy
future. In all these cases one takes as present something that is to come in the
future. This is a serious confusion between the three periods of time. The
perception of permanence, characteristic of concepts, lures one away from
reality into a world of fantasy, with the result that one is overwhelmed and
obsessed by it.</p>
<p>So this is what is meant by <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhasamudācāra</em>. So overwhelming are
reckonings born of prolific perception. As we saw above, the word <em>saṅkhā</em> is
therefore nearer to the idea of reckoning than that of part or portion.</p>
<p><em>Tathāgatas</em> are free from such reckonings born of prolific perception,
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, because they make use of worldly linguistic usages,
conventions and designation, being fully aware of their worldly origin, as if
they were using a child’s language.</p>
<p>When an adult uses a child’s language, he is not bound by it. Likewise, the
Buddhas and <em>arahants</em> do not forget that these are worldly usages. They do not
draw any distinction between the relative and the absolute with regard to those
concepts. For them, they are merely concepts and designations in worldly usage.
That is why the <em>tathāgatas</em> are said to be free from <em>papañca</em>, that is to say
they are <em>nippapañca</em>, whereas the world delights in <em>papañca.</em> This fact is
clearly expressed in the following verse in the <em>Dhammapada</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ākāse va padaṁ natthi</em> <br />
<em>samaṇo natthi bāhire,</em> <br />
<em>papañcābhiratā pajā,</em> <br />
<em>nippapañcā Tathāgatā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn420-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn420">17</a></sup></p>
<p>No track is there in the air, <br />
And no recluse elsewhere, <br />
This populace delights in prolificity, <br />
But ‘Thus-gone-ones’ are non-prolific.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is because the <em>tathāgatas</em> are non-prolific that <em>nippapañca</em> is regarded as
one of the epithets of Nibbāna in a long list of thirty-three.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn421-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn421">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Like <em>dukkhūpasama</em>, quelling of suffering, <em>papañcavūpasama,</em> ‘quelling of
prolificity’, is also recognized as an epithet of Nibbāna. It is also referred
to as <em>papañcanirodha</em>, ‘cessation of prolificity’. We come across such
references to Nibbāna in terms of <em>papañca</em> quite often.</p>
<p>The <em>tathāgatas</em> are free from <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, although they make use of
worldly concepts and designations. In the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> we come across the
dictum <em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn422-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn422">19</a></sup> according to which reckonings
through prolificity arise from perception. Now the <em>tathāgatas</em> have gone beyond
the pale of perception in attaining wisdom. That is why they are free from
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, reckonings born of prolific perception.</p>
<p>Such reckonings are the lot of those who grope in the murk of ignorance, under
the influence of perception. Since Buddhas and <em>arahants</em> are enlightened with
wisdom and released from the limitations of perception, they do not entertain
such reckonings born of prolific perception.</p>
<p>Hence we find the following statement in the <em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tena kho pana samayena Bhagavā attano papañcasaññāsaṅkhāpahānaṁ
paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn423-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn423">20</a></sup></p>
<p>And at that time the Exalted One was seated contemplating his own abandonment
of reckonings born of prolific perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The allusion here is to the bliss of emancipation. Quite a meaningful verse also
occurs in this particular context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa papañcā ṭhiti ca natthi,</em> <br />
<em>sandānaṁ palighañca vītivatto,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ nittaṇhaṁ muniṁ carantaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nāvajānāti sadevako pi loko.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn424-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn424">21</a></sup></p>
<p>To whom there are no proliferations and standstills, <br />
Who has gone beyond the bond and the deadlock, <br />
In that craving-free sage, as he fares along, <br />
The world with its gods sees nothing to decry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two words <em>papañca</em> and <em>ṭhiti</em> in juxtaposition highlight the primary sense
of <em>papañca</em> as a ‘rambling’ or a ‘straying away’. According to the
<em>Nettippakaraṇa</em>, the idiomatic standstill mentioned here refers to the
latencies, <em>anusaya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn425-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn425">22</a></sup></p>
<p>So the rambling <em>papañcas</em> and doggedly persisting <em>anusayas</em> are no longer
there. The two words <em>sanḍānaṁ</em> and <em>palighaṁ</em> are also metaphorically used in
the Dhamma. Views, <em>diṭṭhi</em>, are the bond, and ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, is the
deadlock.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn426-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn426">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The fact that <em>papañca</em> is characteristic of worldly thoughts, connected with
the household life, emerges from the following verse in the <em>Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Papañcasaññā itarītarā narā,</em> <br />
<em>papañcayantā upayanti saññino,</em> <br />
<em>manomayaṁ gehasitañca sabbaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>panujja nekkhammasitaṁ irīyati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn427-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn427">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The common run of humanity, impelled by prolific perception, <br />
Approach their objects with rambling thoughts, limited by perception as they are, <br />
Dispelling all what is mind-made and connected with the household, <br />
One moves towards that which is connected with renunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approach meant here is comparable to the approach of that imaginative poet
towards the ruby shining in moonlight, only to discover a spittle of beetle. The
last two lines of the verse bring out the correct approach of one who is aiming
at Nibbāna. It requires the dispelling of such daydreams connected with the
household as entertained by the nephew of Venerable Saṅgharakkhita Thera.</p>
<p>Worldlings are in the habit of constructing speculative views by taking too
seriously linguistic usage and grammatical structure. All pre-Buddhistic
philosophers made such blunders as the confusion between milk and curd. Their
blunders were mainly due to two reasons, namely, the persistent latency towards
perception and the dogmatic adherence to views. It is precisely these two points
that came up in the very first statement of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>, discussed
in our previous sermon.</p>
<p>That is to say, they formed the gist of the Buddha’s cursory reply to the Sakyan
Daṇḍapāṇi’s question. For the latter it was a riddle and that is why he raised
his eyebrows, wagged his tongue and shook his head. The question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does the recluse assert and what does he proclaim?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn428-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn428">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to whatever doctrine one does not quarrel or dispute with anyone in
the world, such a doctrine do I preach. And due to whatever statements,
perceptions do not underlie as latencies, such statements do I proclaim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might well appear a strange paradox. But since we have already made some
clarification of the two terms <em>saññā</em> and <em>paññā</em>, we might as well bring up
now an excellent quotation to distinguish the difference between these two. It
is in fact the last verse in the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, the
grand finale as it were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāviratassa na santi ganthā,</em> <br />
<em>paññāvimuttassa na santi mohā,</em> <br />
<em>saññañca diṭṭhiñca ye aggahesuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te ghaṭṭhayantā vicaranti loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn429-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn429">26</a></sup></p>
<p>To one unattached to percepts no bonds exist, <br />
In one released through wisdom no delusions persist, <br />
But they that cling to percepts and views, <br />
Go about rambling in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Pupphasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> one comes across the following
declaration of the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, lokena vivadāmi, loko va mayā vivadati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn430-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn430">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that is disputing with
me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks more or less like a contradictory statement, as if one would say “he
is quarrelling with me but I am not quarrelling with him”. However, the truth of
the statement lies in the fact that the Buddha did not hold on to any view. Some
might think that the Buddha also held on to some view or other. But he was
simply using the child’s language, for him there was nothing worth holding on to
in it.</p>
<p>There is a Canonical episode which is a good illustration of this fact. One of
the most well-known among the debates the Buddha had with ascetics of other
sects is the debate with Saccaka, the ascetic. An account of it is found in the
<em>Cūḷasaccakasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>The debate had all the outward appearance of a hot dispute. However, towards the
end of it, the Buddha makes the following challenge to Saccaka:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for you, Aggivessana, drops of sweat have come down from your forehead,
soaked through your upper robe and reached the ground. But, Aggivessana, there
is no sweat on my body now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So saying he uncovered his golden-hued body in that assembly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>iti bhagavā tasmiṁ parisatiṁ suvaṇṇavaṇṇaṁ kāyaṁ vivari</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn431-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn431">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in the midst of a hot debate, the Buddha had no agitation because he did
not adhere to any views. There was for him no bondage in terms of craving,
conceit and views. Even in the thick of a heated debate the Buddha was uniformly
calm and cool.</p>
<p>It is the same with regard to perception. Percepts do not persist as a latency
in him. We spoke of name-and-form as an image or a reflection. Buddhas do no
have the delusion arising out of name-and-form, since they have comprehended it
as a self-image. There is a verse in the <em>Sabhiyasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>
which puts across this idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anuvicca papañca nāmarūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattaṁ bahiddhā ca rogamūlaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sabbarogamūlabandhanā pamutto,</em> <br />
<em>anuvidito tādi pavuccate tathattā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn432-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn432">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Having understood name-and-form, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> which is a product of prolificity, <br />
And which is the root of all malady within and without, <br />
He is released from bondage to the root of all maladies, <br />
That Such-like-one is truly known as <br />
<span class="vin"></span> ‘the one who has understood’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Name-and-form is a product of <em>papañca</em>, the worldling’s prolificity. We spoke
of the reflection of a gem in a pond and the image of a dog on a plank across
the stream.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn433-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn433">30</a></sup> One’s grasp on one’s world of name-and-form is something
similar.</p>
<p>Now as for the Buddha, he has truly comprehended the nature of name-and-form.
Whatever maladies, complications and malignant conditions there are within
beings and around them, the root cause of all that malady is this <em>papañca
nāmarūpa</em>. To be free from it is to be ‘such’. He is the one who has really
understood.</p>
<p>If we are to say something in particular about the latency of perception, we
have to pay special attention to the first discourse in the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.
The advice usually given to one who picks up the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> these days is
to skip the very first sutta. Why? Because it is not easy to understand it. Even
the monks to whom it was preached could not understand it and were displeased.
“It is too deep for us, leave it alone.”</p>
<p>But it must be pointed out that such an advice is not much different from asking
one to learn a language without studying the alphabet. This is because the first
discourse of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, namely the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, enshrines an
extremely vital first principle in the entire field of Buddhist philosophy.</p>
<p>Just as much as the first discourse of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya,</em> namely the
<em>Brahmajālasutta</em>, is of great relevance to the question of views, even so the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> is extremely important for its relevance to the question of
perception.</p>
<p>Now what is the basic theme of this discourse? There is a certain pattern in the
way objects occur to the mind and are apperceived. This discourse lays bare that
elementary pattern. The Buddha opens this discourse with the declaration,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn434-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn434">31</a></sup></p>
<p>monks, I shall preach to you the basic pattern of behaviour of all mind
objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, the discourse deals with twenty-four concepts, representative of
concepts in the world. These are fitted into a schema to illustrate the attitude
of four types of persons towards them.</p>
<p>The twenty-four concepts mentioned in the sutta are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>paṭhavi, āpo, tejo, vāyo, bhūta, deva, Pajāpati, Brahma, Ābhassara,
Subhakinha, Vehapphala, abhibhū, ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ, viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ,
ākiñcañāyatanaṁ, nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ, diṭṭhaṁ, sutaṁ, mutaṁ, viññātaṁ,
ekattaṁ, nānattaṁ, sabbaṁ, Nibbānaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Earth, water, fire, air, beings, gods, Pajāpati, Brahma, the Abhassara
Brahmas, the Subhakinha Brahmas, the Vehapphala Brahmas, the overlord, the
realm of infinite space, the realm of infinite consciousness, the realm of
nothingness, the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the seen, the
heard, the sensed, the cognised, unity, diversity, all, Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discourse describes the differences of attitude in four types of persons
with regard to each of these concepts. The four persons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for the Noble Ones and is
unskilled in their Dhamma, <em>assutavā puthujjana</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A monk who is in higher training, whose mind has not yet reached the goal and
who is aspiring to the supreme security from bondage, <em>bhikkhu sekho
appattamānaso.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>arahant</em> with taints destroyed who has lived the holy life, done what has
to be done, laid down the burden, reached the goal, destroyed the fetters of
existence and who is completely liberated through final knowledge, <em>arahaṁ
khīṇāsavo</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tathāgata, accomplished and fully enlightened, <em>Tathāgato arahaṁ
sammāsambuddho</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of these, the second category comprises the Stream-winner, the Once-returner
and the Non-returner. Though there are four types, according to the analysis of
their attitudes, the last two can be regarded as one type, since their attitudes
to those concepts are the same. So we might as well speak of three kinds of
attitudes. Let us now try to understand the difference between them.</p>
<p>What is the world-view of the untaught ordinary person, the worldling? The
Buddha describes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito sañjānāti. Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito saññatvā paṭhaviṁ maññati,
paṭhaviyā maññati, paṭhavito maññati, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati, paṭhaviṁ
abhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? Apariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>He perceives earth as ‘earth’. Having perceived earth as ‘earth’, he imagines
‘earth’ as such, he imagines ‘on the earth’, he imagines ‘from the earth’, he
imagines ‘earth is mine’, he delights in earth. Why is that? I say that it is
because he has not fully comprehended it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The untaught ordinary person can do no better than to perceive earth as ‘earth’,
since he is simply groping in the dark. So he perceives earth as ‘earth’ and
goes on imagining, for which the word used here is <em>maññati</em>, methinks. One
usually methinks when a simile or a metaphor occurs, as a figure of speech. But
here it is something more than that. Here it refers to an indulgence in a
deluded mode of thinking under the influence of craving, conceit and views.
Perceiving earth as ‘earth’, he imagines earth to be substantially ‘earth’.</p>
<p>Then he resorts to inflection, to make it flexible or amenable to his
methinking. ‘On the earth’, ‘from the earth’, ‘earth is mine’, are so many
subtle ways of methinking, with which he finally finds delight in the very
concept of earth. The reason for all this is the fact that he has not fully
comprehended it.</p>
<p>Then comes the world-view of the monk who is in higher training, that is, the
<em>sekha</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhijānāti. Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ mā
maññi, paṭhaviyā mā maññi, paṭhavito mā maññi, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti mā maññi,
paṭhaviṁ mābhinandi. Taṁ kissa hetu? Pariññeyyaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>He understands through higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’. Having known through
higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’, let him not imagine ‘earth’ as such, let
him not imagine ‘on the earth’, let him not imagine ‘from the earth’, let him
not imagine ‘earth is mine’, let him not delight in earth. Why is that? I say
it is because it should be well comprehended by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the monk who is in higher training, he does not merely perceive, but
understands through higher knowledge.</p>
<p>Here we are against a peculiar expression, which is rather problematic, that is,
<em>mā maññi</em>.</p>
<p>The commentary simply glosses over with the words <em>maññatī’ti maññi</em>, taking it
to mean the same as <em>maññati</em>, ‘imagines’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn435-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn435">32</a></sup> Its only explanation for the
use of this peculiar expression in this context is that the <em>sekha</em>, or the one
in higher training, has already done away with <em>diṭṭhimaññanā</em> or imagining in
terms of views, though he still has imaginings through craving and conceit. So,
for the commentary, <em>mā maññi</em> is a sort of mild recognition of residual
imagining, a dilly-dally phrase. But this interpretation is not at all
convincing.</p>
<p>Obviously enough the particle <em>mā</em> has a prohibitive sense here, and <em>mā maññi</em>
means ‘let one not imagine’, or ‘let one not entertain imaginings’, <em>maññanā</em>.</p>
<p>A clear instance of the use of this expression in this sense is found at the end
of the <em>Samiddhisutta</em>, discussed in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn436-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn436">33</a></sup> Venerable
Samiddhi answered Venerable Sāriputta’s catechism creditably and the latter
acknowledged it with a ‘well-done’, <em>sādhu sādhu</em>, but cautioned him not to be
proud of it, <em>tena ca mā maññi</em>, “but do not be vain on account of it”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn437-1"><a href="sermon-12.html#fn-fn437">34</a></sup></p>
<p>The use of the prohibitive particle with reference to the world-view of the monk
in higher training is quite apt, as he has to train himself in overcoming the
tendency to go on imagining. For him it is a step of training towards full
comprehension. That is why the Buddha concludes with the words: “Why is that? I
say it is because it should be well comprehended by him.”</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the thirteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we attempted an exposition under the topic
<em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāya</em>, “the basic pattern of behaviour of all mind objects”,
which constitutes the theme of the very first sutta of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>,
namely the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>We happened to mention that the discourse describes three different attitudes
regarding twenty-four concepts such as earth, water, fire and air. We could
however discuss only two of them the other day, namely the world view, or the
attitude of the untaught ordinary person, and the attitude of the noble one, who
is in higher training.</p>
<p>So today, to begin with, let us bring up the third type of attitude given in the
discourse, that is, the attitude of <em>arahants</em> and that of the Tathāgata, both
being similar. It is described in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhijānāti, paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ na
maññati, paṭhaviyā na maññati, paṭhavito na maññati, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti na
maññati, paṭhaviṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? ’Pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn439-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn439">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> (as well as the Tathāgata) understands through higher knowledge
earth as ‘earth’, having understood through higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’,
he does not imagine earth to be ‘earth’, he does not imagine ‘on the earth’,
he does not imagine ‘from the earth’, he does not imagine ‘earth is mine’, he
does not delight in earth. Why is that? I say, it is because it has been well
comprehended by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us now try to compare and contrast these three attitudes, so that we can
understand them in greater detail. The attitude of the untaught ordinary person
in regard to any of the twenty-four concepts like earth, water, fire, air (the
twenty-four cited being illustrations), is so oriented that he perceives it as
such.</p>
<p>For instance in the case of earth, he perceives a real earth, that is, takes it
as earth per se. It may sometimes be only a block of ice, but because it is hard
to the touch, he grasps it as ‘earth’. Thus the ordinary person, the worldling,
relies only on perception in his pursuit of knowledge. Having perceived earth as
‘earth’, he imagines it to be ‘earth’. The peculiarity of <em>maññanā</em>, or
‘me’-thinking, is that it is an imagining in terms of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.</p>
<p>So he first imagines it as ‘earth’, then he imagines ‘on the earth’, ‘from the
earth’, ‘earth is mine’ and delights in the earth. Here we find various
flexional forms known to grammar.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, grammar itself is a product of the worldlings for purposes
of transaction in ideas bound up with defilements. Its purpose is to enable
beings, who are overcome by the personality view, to communicate with their
like-minded fellow beings. Grammar, therefore, is something that caters to their
needs. As such, it embodies certain misconceptions, some of which have been
highlighted in this context.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>paṭhaviṁ maññati</em> could be interpreted as an attempt to imagine
an earth – as a full-fledged noun or substantive. It is conceived as something
substantial. By <em>paṭhaviyā maññāti</em>, “he imagines ‘on the earth’”, the locative
case is implied; while <em>’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati</em>, “he imagines ‘earth is mine’”,
is an instance of the genitive case, expressing the idea of possession.</p>
<p>Due to such imaginings, a reality is attributed to the concept of ‘earth’ and
its existence is taken for granted. In other words, these various forms of
imaginings go to confirm the notion already aroused by the concept of ‘earth’.
Once it is confirmed one can delight in it, <em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em>. This, then,
is the worldview of the untaught ordinary person.</p>
<p>The other day we mentioned that the monk who is in higher training understands
through higher knowledge, not through perception, earth as ‘earth’. Though it is
a higher level of understanding, he is not totally free from imaginings. That is
why certain peculiar expressions are used in connection with him, such as
<em>paṭaviṁ mā maññi, paṭhaviyā mā maññi, paṭhavito mā maññi, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti mā
maññi, paṭhaviṁ mā abhinandi.</em></p>
<p>Here we have to call in question the commentarial explanation. According to the
commentary, this peculiar expression had to be used as a dilly dally phrase,
because the monk in higher training could not be said to imagine or not
imagine.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn440-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn440">3</a></sup> But it is clear enough that the particle <em>mā</em> in this context
is used in its prohibitive sense. <em>Mā maññi</em> means “do not imagine!”, and <em>mā
abhinandi</em> means “do not delight!”.</p>
<p>What is significant about the <em>sekha</em>, the monk in higher training, is that he
is in a stage of voluntary training. In fact, the word <em>sekha</em> literally means a
‘learner’. That is to say, he has obtained a certain degree of higher
understanding but has not attained as yet full comprehension.</p>
<p>It is precisely for that reason that the section about him is summed up by the
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṁ kissa hetu? Pariññeyyaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>Why is that? Because, I say, that it should be comprehended by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since he has yet to comprehend it, he is following that course of higher
training. The particle <em>mā</em> is therefore a pointer to that effect. For example,
<em>mā maññi</em> “do not imagine!”, <em>mā abhinandi</em> “do not delight!”.</p>
<p>In other words, the monk in higher training cannot help using the grammatical
structure in usage among the worldlings and as his latencies are not extinct as
yet, he has to practise a certain amount of restraint. By constant employment of
mindfulness and wisdom he makes an attempt to be immune to the influence of the
worldling’s grammatical structure.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that he would be carried away by the implications of such
concepts as earth, water, fire and air, in his communications with the world
regarding them. So he strives to proceed towards full comprehension with the
help of the higher understanding already won, keeping mindfulness and wisdom
before him. That is the voluntary training implied here.</p>
<p>The monk in higher training is called <em>attagutto</em>, in the sense that he tries to
guard himself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn441-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn441">4</a></sup> Such phrases like <em>mā maññi</em> indicate that voluntary
training in guarding himself. Here we had to add something more to the
commentarial explanation. So this is the situation with the monk in higher
training.</p>
<p>Now as to the <em>arahant</em> and the Tathāgata, the world views of both are
essentially the same. That is to say, they both have a higher knowledge as well
as a full comprehension with regard to the concept of earth, for instance.
<em>Pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi</em>, “I say it has been comprehended by him”.</p>
<p>As such, they are not carried away by the implications of the worldlings’
grammatical structure. They make use of the worldly usage much in the same way
as parents do when they are speaking in their child’s language. They are not
swept away by it. There is no inner entanglement in the form of imagining. There
is no attachment, entanglement and involvement by way of craving, conceit and
view, in regard to those concepts.</p>
<p>All this goes to show the immense importance of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>. One can
understand why this sutta came to be counted as the first among the suttas of
the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. It is as if this sutta was intended to serve as the
alphabet in deciphering the words used by the Buddha in his sermons delivered in
discursive style. As a matter of fact the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> in particular is a
text abounding in deep suttas. This way we can understand why both higher
knowledge and full comprehension are essential.</p>
<p>We have shown above that this discourse bears some relation to the grammatical
structure. Probably due to a lack of recognition of this relationship between
the modes of imagining and the grammatical structure, the commentators were
confronted with a problem while commenting upon this discourse.</p>
<p>Such phrases as <em>paṭhaviṁ maññati</em> and <em>paṭhaviyā maññati</em> occur all over this
discourse in referring to various ways of imagining. The commentator, however,
always makes it a point to interpret these ways of imagining with reference to
craving, conceit and views. So when he comes to the phrase <em>mā abhinandi</em>, he
finds it to be superfluous. That is why Venerable Buddhaghosa treats it as a
repetition and poses a possible question as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Paṭhaviṁ maññatī’ti’ eteneva etasmiṁ atthe siddhe kasmā evaṁ vuttanti ce.
Avicāritaṁ etaṁ porāṇehi. Ayaṁ pana me attano mati, desanāvilāsato vā
ādīnavadassanato vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn442-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn442">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is how the commentator poses his own problem: When the phrase <em>paṭhaviṁ
maññati</em> by itself fulfils the purpose, why is it that an additional phrase like
<em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em> is brought in? That is to say, if the imagining already
implies craving, conceit and views, what is the justification for the concluding
phrase <em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em>, “he delights in earth”, since craving already
implies a form of delighting?</p>
<p>So he takes it as a repetition and seeks for a justification. He confesses that
the ancients have not handed down an explanation and offers his own personal
opinion on it, <em>ayaṁ pana me attano mati,</em> “but then this is my own opinion”.</p>
<p>And what does his own explanation amount to? <em>Desanāvilāsato vā ādīnavadassanato
vā</em>, “either as a particular style in preaching, or by way of showing the perils
of the ways of imagining”. He treats it as yet another way of preaching peculiar
to the Buddha, or else as an attempt to emphasize the perils of imagining.</p>
<p>However, going by the explanation we have already given above, relating these
modes of imagining to the structure of grammar, we can come to a conclusion as
to why the phrase <em>mā abhinandi</em> was brought in.</p>
<p>The reason is that each of those concepts crystallized into a real thing as a
result of imagining, based on the framework of grammar. It received real object
status in the world of imagination. Once its object status got confirmed, one
can certainly delight in it. It became a thing in truth and fact. The purpose of
these ways of imagining is to mould it into a thing.</p>
<p>Let us go deeper into this problem. There is, for instance, a certain recurrent
passage in the discourses on the subject of sense restraint.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn443-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn443">6</a></sup> The gist of
that passage amounts to this: A person with defilements takes in signs and
features through all the six sense doors, inclusive of the mind.</p>
<p>Due to that grasping at signs and features, various kinds of influxes are said
to flow in, according to the passages outlining the practice of sense restraint.
From this we can well infer that the role of <em>maññanā</em>, or imagining, is to
grasp at signs with regard to the objects of the mind.</p>
<p>That is to say, the mind apperceives its object as ‘something’, <em>dhammasaññā</em>.
The word <em>dhamma</em> in the opening sentence of this sutta,
<em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi</em>, means a ‘thing’, since
every-thing is an object of the mind in the last analysis.</p>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ maññati</em>, “he imagines earth as earth”, is suggestive of a grasping at
the sign in regard to objects of the mind. Thinking in such terms as <em>paṭhaviyā
maññati, paṭhavito maññāti</em>, and <em>’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati</em>, “he imagines ‘on the
earth’, he imagines ‘from the earth’, he imagines ‘earth is mine’”, are like the
corroborative features that go to confirm that sign already grasped.</p>
<p>The two terms <em>nimitta,</em> sign, and <em>anuvyañjana</em>, feature, in the context of
sense restraint have to be understood in this way. Now the purpose of a
<em>nimitta</em>, or sign, is to give a hazy idea like ‘this may be so’.</p>
<p>It receives confirmation with the help of corroborative features, <em>anuvyañjana</em>,
all the features that are accessory to the sign. The corroboration comes, for
instance, in this manner: ‘This goes well with this, this accords with this,
therefore the sign I took is right’. So even on the basis of instructions on
sense restraint, we can understand the special significance of this <em>maññanā</em>,
or ‘me’-thinking.</p>
<p>The reason for the occurrence of these different ways of me-thinking can also be
understood. In this discourse the Buddha is presenting a certain philosophy of
the grammatical structure. The structure of grammar is a contrivance for
conducting the worldlings’ thought process, characterised by the perception of
permanence, as well as for communication of ideas arising out of that process.</p>
<p>The grammatical structure invests words with life, as it were. This mode of
hypostasizing is revealed in the nouns and substantives implying such notions as
‘in it’, ‘by it’ and ‘from it’. The last of the flexional forms, the vocative
case, <em>he paṭhavi</em>, “hey earth”, effectively illustrates this hypostasizing
character of grammar. It is even capable of infusing life into the concept of
‘earth’ and arousing it with the words “hey earth”.</p>
<p>In an earlier sermon we had occasion to refer to a legend in which a tiger was
reconstituted and resurrected out of its skeletal remains.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn444-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn444">7</a></sup> The structure
of grammar seems to be capable of a similar feat. The <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> gives
us an illustration of this fact.</p>
<p>It is because of the obsessional character of this <em>maññanā</em>, or me-thinking,
that the Buddha has presented this <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> to the world as the basic
pattern or paradigm representing three types of world views, or the world views
of three types of persons.</p>
<p>This discourse deals with the untaught ordinary person, who is obsessed by this
grammatical structure, the disciple in higher training, who is trying to free
himself from its grip, and the emancipated one, completely free from it, at the
same time giving their respective world views as well.</p>
<p>The other day we enumerated the list of twenty-four concepts, presented in that
discourse. Out of these concepts, we have to pay special attention to the fact
that Nibbāna is counted as the last, since it happens to be the theme of all our
sermons.</p>
<p>Regarding this concept of Nibbāna too, the worldling is generally tempted to
entertain some kind of <em>maññanā</em>, or me-thinking. Even some philosophers are
prone to that habit. They indulge in some sort of prolific conceptualisation and
me-thinking on the basis of such conventional usages as ‘in Nibbāna’, ‘from
Nibbāna’, ‘on reaching Nibbāna’ and ‘my Nibbāna’. By hypostasizing Nibbāna they
develop a substance view, even of this concept, just as in the case of
<em>paṭhavi</em>, or earth. Let us now try to determine whether this is justifiable.</p>
<p>The primary sense of the word Nibbāna is ‘extinction’, or ‘extinguishment’. We
have already discussed this point with reference to such contexts as
<em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn445-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn445">8</a></sup> In that discourse the Buddha explained the term
Nibbāna to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta with the help of a simile of the
extinction of a fire. Simply because a fire is said to go out, one should not
try to trace it, wondering where it has gone.</p>
<p>The term Nibbāna is essentially a verbal noun. We also came across the phrase
<em>nibbuto tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em>, “it is reckoned as ‘extinguished’”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn446-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn446">9</a></sup></p>
<p>As we have already pointed out in a previous sermon, <em>saṅkhā</em>, <em>samaññā</em> and
<em>paññatti</em>, ‘reckoning’, ‘appellation’ and ‘designation’ are more or less
synonymous.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn447-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn447">10</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em> only means “comes to be reckoned”. Nibbāna is therefore some
sort of reckoning, an appellation or designation. The word Nibbāna, according to
the <em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em>, is a designation or a concept.</p>
<p>But the commentator takes much pains to prove that the Nibbāna mentioned at the
end of the list in the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> refers not to our orthodox Nibbāna,
but to a concept of Nibbāna upheld by heretics.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn448-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn448">11</a></sup> The commentator, it
seems, is at pains to salvage our Nibbāna, but his attempt is at odds with the
trend of this discourse, because the <em>sekha</em>, or the monk in higher training,
has no need to train himself in refraining from delighting in any heretical
Nibbāna. So here too, the reference is to our orthodox Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Presumably the commentator could not understand why the <em>arahants</em> do not
delight in Nibbāna. For instance, in the section on the Tathāgata one reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nibbānaṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? Nandi dukkhassa mūlan’ti iti viditvā,
bhavā jāti, bhūtassa jarāmaraṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>He does not delight in Nibbāna. Why so? Because he knows that delighting is
the root of suffering, and from becoming comes birth and to the one become
there is decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems, then, that the Tathāgata does not delight in Nibbāna, because
delighting is the root of suffering. Now <em>nandi</em> is a form of grasping,
<em>upādāna</em>, impelled by craving. It is sometimes expressly called an <em>upādāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā vedanāsu nandi tadupādānaṁ,</em></p>
<p>whatever delighting there is in feeling, that is a grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn449-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn449">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where there is delighting, there is a grasping. Where there is grasping, there
is <em>bhava</em>, becoming or existence. From becoming comes birth, and to the one who
has thus come to be there is decay-and-death.</p>
<p>It is true that we project the concept of Nibbāna as an objective to aim at in
our training. But if we grasp it like the concept of earth and start indulging
in me-thinkings or imaginings about it, we would never be able to realize it.
Why? Because what we have here is an extraordinary path leading to an
emancipation from all concepts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nissāya nissāya oghassa nittharaṇā,</em></p>
<p>“crossing over the flood with relative dependence”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn450-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn450">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever is necessary is made use of, but there is no grasping in terms of
craving, conceits and views. That is why even with reference to the Tathāgata
the phrase <em>Nibbānaṁ nābhinandati</em>, “he does not delight in Nibbāna”, occurs in
this discourse.</p>
<p>One might ask: “What is wrong in delighting in Nibbāna?” But then we might
recall a pithy dialogue already quoted in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn451-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn451">14</a></sup> A deity
comes and accosts the Buddha: “Do you rejoice, recluse?” And the Buddha
responds: “On getting what, friend?” Then the deity asks: “Well then, recluse,
do you grieve?” And the Buddha retorts: “On losing what, friend?” The deity now
mildly remarks: “So then, recluse, you neither rejoice nor grieve!” And the
Buddha confirms it with the assent: “That is so, friend.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn452-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn452">15</a></sup></p>
<p>This then is the attitude of the Buddha and the <em>arahants</em> to the concept of
Nibbāna. There is nothing to delight in it, only equanimity is there.</p>
<p>Seen in this perspective, the word Nibbāna mentioned in the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>
need not be taken as referring to a concept of Nibbāna current among heretics.
The reference here is to our own orthodox Nibbāna concept. But the attitude
towards it must surely be changed in the course of treading the path to it.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, one grasps it tenaciously and takes it to be substantial,
presuming that the word is a full fledged noun, and goes on to argue it out on
the basis of logic and proliferate on it conceptually, it will no longer be our
Nibbāna. There one slips into wrong view. One would never be able to extricate
oneself from wrong view that way. Here then is an issue of crucial importance.</p>
<p>Many philosophers start their exposition with an implicit acceptance of
conditionality. But when they come to the subject of Nibbāna, they have recourse
to some kind of instrumentality. “On reaching Nibbāna, lust and delight are
abandoned.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn453-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn453">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Commentators resort to such explanations under the influence of <em>maññanā</em>. They
seem to imply that Nibbāna is instrumental in quenching the fires of defilement.
To say that the fires of defilements are quenched by Nibbāna, or on arriving at
it, is to get involved in a circular argument. It is itself an outcome of
<em>papañca</em>, or conceptual prolificity, and betrays an enslavement to the syntax.</p>
<p>When one says ‘the river flows’, it does not mean that there is a river quite
apart from the act of flowing. Likewise the idiom ‘it rains’ should not be taken
to imply that there is something that rains. It is only a turn of speech,
fulfilling a certain requirement of the grammatical structure.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion we happened to discuss some very important aspects of the
<em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn454-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn454">17</a></sup> We saw how the Buddha presented a philosophy of
language, which seems so extraordinary even to modern thinkers. This
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> also brings out a similar attitude to the linguistic medium.</p>
<p>Such elements of a language as nouns and verbs reflect the worldling’s mode of
thinking. As in the case of a child’s imagination, a noun appears as a must. So
it has to rain for there to be rain. The implicit verbal sense becomes obscured,
or else it is ignored. A periphrastic usage receives acceptance. So the rain
rains, and the river flows. A natural phenomenon becomes mystified and
hypostasized.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism is a characteristic of the pre-historic man’s philosophy of
life. Wherever there was an activity, he imagined some form of life. This
animistic trend of thought is evident even in the relation between the noun and
the verb. The noun has adjectives as attributes and the verb has adverbs to go
with it. Particles fall in between, and there we have what is called grammar. If
one imagines that the grammar of language must necessarily conform to the
grammar of nature, one falls into a grievous error.</p>
<p>Now the commentators also seem to have fallen into such an error in their
elaborate exegesis on Nibbāna, due to a lack of understanding of this philosophy
of language. That is why the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> now finds itself relegated,
though it is at the head of the suttas of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of concepts that nouns are invested with a certain amount of
permanence. Even a verbal noun, once it is formed, gets a degree of permanence
more or less superimposed on it. When one says ‘the river flows’, one somehow
tends to forget the flowing nature of the so-called river. This is the result of
the perception of permanence.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, perception as such carries with it the notion of
permanence, as we mentioned in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn455-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn455">18</a></sup> To perceive is to
grasp a sign. One can grasp a sign only where one imagines some degree of
permanence.</p>
<p>The purpose of perception is not only to recognize for oneself, but also to make
it known to others. The Buddha has pointed out that there is a very close
relationship between recognition and communication. This fact is expressly
stated by the Buddha in the following quotation from the Sixes of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vohāravepakkaṁ ahaṁ, bhikkhave, saññaṁ vadāmi. Yathā yathā naṁ sañjānāti,
tathā tathā voharati, evaṁ saññī ahosin’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn456-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn456">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I say that perception has linguistic usage as its result. In whatever
way one perceives, so one speaks out about it, saying: ‘I was of such a
perception’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>vepakka</em> is a derivative from the word <em>vipāka</em>, which in the context
of <em>kamma</em>, or ethically significant action, generally means the result of that
action. In this context, however, its primary sense is evident, that is, as some
sort of a ripening. In other words, what this quotation implies is that
perception ripens or matures into verbal usage or convention.</p>
<p>So here we see the connection between <em>saññā</em>, perception, and <em>saṅkhā</em>,
reckoning. This throws more light on our earlier explanation of the last line of
a verse in the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā,</em></p>
<p>for reckonings born of prolificity have perception as their source.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn457-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn457">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we are in a better position to appreciate the statement that linguistic
usages, reckonings and designations are the outcome of perception. All this goes
to show that an insight into the philosophy of language is essential for a
proper understanding of this Dhamma. This is the moral behind the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Beings are usually dominated by these reckonings, appellations and designations,
because the perception of permanence is inherent in them. It is extremely
difficult for one to escape it. Once the set of such terms as milk, curd and
butter comes into vogue, the relation between them becomes an insoluble problem
even for the great philosophers.</p>
<p>Since we have been talking about the concept of Nibbāna so much, one might ask:
“So then, Nibbāna is not an absolute, <em>paramattha</em>?” It is not a <em>paramattha</em> in
the sense of an absolute. It is a <em>paramattha</em> only in the sense that it is the
highest good, <em>parama attha</em>.</p>
<p>This is the sense in which the word was used in the discourses,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn458-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn458">21</a></sup> though
it has different connotations now. As exemplified by such quotations as
<em>āraddhaviriyo paramatthapattiyā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn459-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn459">22</a></sup> “with steadfast energy for the
attainment of the highest good”, the suttas speak of Nibbāna as the highest good
to be attained.</p>
<p>In later Buddhist thought, however, the word <em>paramattha</em> came to acquire
absolutist connotations, due to which some important discourses of the Buddha on
the question of worldly appellations, worldly expressions and worldly
designations fell into disuse. This led to an attitude of dwelling in the
scaffolding, improvised just for the purpose of constructing a building.</p>
<p>As a postscript to our exposition of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> we may add the
following important note: This particular discourse is distinguished from all
other discourses in respect of one significant feature. That is, the concluding
statement to the effect that the monks who listened to the sermon were not
pleased by it.</p>
<p>Generally we find at the end of a discourse a more or less thematic sentence
like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>attamanā te bhikkhū Bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinanduṁ,</em></p>
<p>those monks were pleased and they rejoiced in the words of the
Exalted One.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn460-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn460">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in this sutta we find the peculiar ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>idaṁ avoca Bhagavā, na te bhikkhū Bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinanduṁ,</em></p>
<p>the Exalted One said this, but those monks did not rejoice in the words of the
Exalted One.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn461-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn461">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commentators seem to have interpreted this attitude as an index to the
abstruseness of the discourse.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn462-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn462">25</a></sup> This is probably why this discourse came
to be neglected in the course of time.</p>
<p>But on the basis of the exposition we have attempted, we might advance a
different interpretation of the attitude of those monks. The declaration that
none of the concepts, including that of Nibbāna, should be egoistically
imagined, could have caused displeasure in monks, then as now. So much, then,
for the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>The Buddha has pointed out that this <em>maññanā</em>, or egoistic imagining, or
me-thinking, is an extremely subtle bond of Māra.</p>
<p>A discourse which highlights this fact comes in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> under the
title <em>Yavakalāpisutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn463-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn463">26</a></sup> In this discourse the Buddha brings out this
fact with the help of a parable. It concerns the battle between gods and demons,
which is a theme that comes up quite often in the discourses.</p>
<p>In a war between gods and demons, the gods are victorious and the demons are
defeated. The gods bind Vepacitti, the king of the demons, in a fivefold
bondage, that is, hands and feet and neck, and bring him before Sakka, the king
of the gods.</p>
<p>This bondage has a strange mechanism about it. When Vepacitti thinks “gods are
righteous, demons are unrighteous, I will go to the <em>deva</em> world”, he
immediately finds himself free from that bondage and capable of enjoying the
heavenly pleasures of the five senses.</p>
<p>But as soon as he slips into the thought “gods are unrighteous, demons are
righteous, I will go back to the <em>asura</em> world”, he finds himself divested of
the heavenly pleasures and bound again by the fivefold bonds.</p>
<p>After introducing this parable, the Buddha comes out with a deep disquisition of
Dhamma for which it serves as a simile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ sukhumaṁ kho, bhikkhave, Vepacittibandhanaṁ. Tato sukhumataraṁ
Mārabandhanaṁ. Maññamāno kho, bhikkhave, baddho Mārassa, amaññamāno mutto
pāpimato.</em></p>
<p><em>Asmī’ti, bhikkhave, maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’ayaṁ ahaṁ asmī’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ,
’bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’na bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’rūpī
bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’arūpī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’saññī
bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’asaññī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ,
’nevasaññīnāsaññī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Maññitaṁ, bhikkhave, rogo, maññitaṁ gaṇḍo, maññitaṁ sallaṁ. Tasmātiha,
bhikkhave, ’amaññamānena cetasā viharissāmā’ti evañhi vo, bhikkhave,
sikkhitabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p>So subtle, monks, is the bondage of Vepacitti. But more subtle still is the
bondage of Māra. Imagining, monks, one is bound by Māra, not imagining one is
freed from the Evil One.</p>
<p>‘Am’, monks, is an imagining, ‘this am I’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be’ is an
imagining, ‘I shall not be’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be one with form’ is an
imagining, ‘I shall be formless’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be percipient’ is
an imagining, ‘I shall be non-percipient’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is an imagining.</p>
<p>Imagining, monks, is a disease, imagining is an abscess, imagining is a barb,
therefore, monks, should you tell yourselves: ‘We shall dwell with a mind free
from imaginings, thus should you train yourselves’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, let us try to get at the meaning of this exhortation. The opening
sentence is an allusion to the simile given above. It says that the bondage in
which Vepacitti finds himself is of a subtle nature, that is to say, it is a
bondage connected with his thoughts. Its very mechanism is dependent on his
thoughts.</p>
<p>But then the Buddha declares that the bondage of Māra is even subtler. And what
is this bondage of Māra? “Imagining, monks, one is bound by Māra, not imagining
one is freed from that Evil One.” Then comes a list of nine different ways of
imaginings.</p>
<p>In the same discourse the Buddha goes on to qualify each of these imaginings
with four significant terms, namely: <em>iñjitaṁ</em> agitation, <em>phanditaṁ</em>
palpitation, <em>papañcitaṁ</em> proliferation and <em>mānagataṁ</em> conceit.</p>
<p><em>Iñjitaṁ</em> is an indication that these forms of imaginings are the outcome of
craving, since <em>ejā</em> is a synonym for <em>taṇhā</em>, or craving.</p>
<p><em>Phanditaṁ</em> is an allusion to the fickleness of the mind, as for instance
conveyed by the first line of a verse in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, <em>phandanaṁ capalaṁ
cittaṁ</em>, “the mind, palpitating and fickle”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn464-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn464">27</a></sup> The fickle nature of the
mind brings out those imaginings.</p>
<p>They are also the products of proliferation, <em>papañcita</em>. We have already
discussed the meaning of the term <em>papañca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn465-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn465">28</a></sup> We happened to point out
that it is a sort of straying away from the proper path.</p>
<p><em>Mānagataṁ</em> is suggestive of a measuring. <em>Asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is the most
elementary standard of measurement. It is the peg from which all measurements
take their direction. As we pointed out in an earlier sermon, the grammatical
structure of language is based on this peg ‘am’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn466-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn466">29</a></sup></p>
<p>In connection with the three persons, first person, second person and third
person, we happened to mention that as soon as one grants ‘I am’, a ‘here’ is
born. It is only after a ‘here’ is born, that a ‘there’ and a ‘yonder’ come to
be. The first person gives rise to the second and the third person, to complete
the basic framework for grammar.</p>
<p>So <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is itself a product of proliferation. In fact, the deviation
from the proper path, implied by the proliferation in <em>papañca</em>, is a result of
these multifarious imaginings.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of these imaginings that as soon as an imagining or a
me-thinking occurs, a thing is born as a matter of course. And with the birth of
a thing as ‘something’, impermanence takes over. That is to say, it comes under
the sway of impermanence.</p>
<p>This is a very strange phenomenon. It is only after becoming a ‘something’ that
it can become ‘another thing’. <em>Aññathābhāva</em>, or otherwiseness, implies a
change from one state to another. A change of state already presupposes some
state or other, and that is what is called a ‘thing’.</p>
<p>Now where does a ‘thing’ arise? It arises in the mind. As soon as something gets
hold of the mind, that thing gets infected with the germ of impermanence.</p>
<p>The modes of imagining listed above reveal a double bind. There is no freedom
either way. Whether one imagines ‘I shall be with form’ or ‘I shall be
formless’, one is in a dichotomy. It is the same with the two ways of imagining
‘I shall be percipient’, ‘I shall be non-percipient’.</p>
<p>We had occasion to refer to this kind of dichotomy while explaining the
significance of quite a number of discourses. The root of all this duality is
the thought ‘am’.</p>
<p>The following two verses from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> throw light on some
subtle aspects of <em>maññanā</em>, or imagining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti,</em> <br />
<em>tato taṁ hoti aññathā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ hi tassa musā hoti,</em> <br />
<em>mosadhammaṁ hi ittaraṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Amosadhammaṁ Nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā saccato vidū,</em> <br />
<em>te ve saccābhisamayā,</em> <br />
<em>nicchātā parinibbutā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn467-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn467">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In whatever way they imagine, <br />
Thereby it turns otherwise, <br />
That itself is the falsity <br />
Of this puerile deceptive thing.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is unfalsifying in its nature, <br />
That they understood as the truth, <br />
And indeed by the higher understanding of that truth <br />
They have become hungerless and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first verse makes it clear that imagining is at the root of <em>aññathābhāva</em>,
or otherwiseness, in so far as it creates a thing out of nothing. As soon as a
thing is conceived in the mind by imagining, the germ of otherwiseness or change
enters into it at its very conception.</p>
<p>So a thing is born only to become another thing, due to the otherwiseness in
nature. To grasp a thing tenaciously is to exist with it, and birth, decay and
death are the inexorable vicissitudes that go with it.</p>
<p>The second verse says that Nibbāna is known as the truth, because it is of an
unfalsifying nature. Those who have understood it are free from the hunger of
craving. The word <em>parinibbuta</em> in this context does not mean that those who
have realized the truth have passed away. It only conveys the idea of full
appeasement or a quenching of that hunger.</p>
<p>Why is Nibbāna regarded as unfalsifying? Because there is no ‘thing’ in it. It
is so long as there is a thing that all the distress and misery follow. Nibbāna
is called <em>animitta</em>, or the signless, precisely because there is no-thing in
it.</p>
<p>Because it is signless, it is unestablished, <em>appaṇihita</em>. Only where there is
an establishment can there be a dislodgement. Since it is not liable to
dislodgement or disintegration, it is unshakeable. It is called <em>akuppā
cetovimutti</em>, unshakeable deliverance of the mind,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn468-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn468">31</a></sup> because of its
unshaken and stable nature. Due to the absence of craving there is no
directional apsiration, or <em>paṇidhi</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly <em>suññata</em>, or voidness, is a term implying that there is no essence in
Nibbāna in the substantial sense in which the worldlings use that term. As
mentioned in the <em>Mahāsāropamasutta</em>, deliverance itself is the essence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn469-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn469">32</a></sup>
Apart from that, there is nothing essential or substantial in Nibbāna. In short,
there is no thing to become otherwise in Nibbāna.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion, too, we had to mention the fact that there is quite a
lot of confusion in this concern.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn470-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn470">33</a></sup> <em>Saṅkhata</em>, the compounded, is
supposed to be a thing. And <em>asaṅkhata</em>, or the uncompounded, is also a thing.
The compounded is an impermanent thing, while the uncompounded is a permanent
thing. The compounded is fraught with suffering, and the uncompounded is
blissful. The compounded is not self, but the uncompounded is … At this point
the line of argument breaks off.</p>
<p>Some of those who attempt this kind of explanation find themselves in a quandary
due to their lack of understanding of the issues involved. The two verses quoted
above are therefore highly significant.</p>
<p>Because of <em>maññanā</em>, worldlings tend to grasp, hold on and adhere to
mind-objects. The Buddha has presented these concepts just for the purpose of
crossing over the flood,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>desitā nissāya nissāya oghassa nittharaṇā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn471-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn471">34</a></sup></p>
<p>the process of crossing over the flood with relative dependence has been
preached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the <em>dhammas</em> that have been preached are for a practical purpose, based on
an understanding of their relative value, and not for grasping tenaciously, as
illustrated by such discourses like the <em>Rathavinītasutta</em> and the
<em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn472-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn472">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Let alone other concepts, not even Nibbāna as a concept is to be grasped. To
grasp the concept of Nibbāna is to slip into an error. So from the couplet
quoted above we clearly understand how subtle this <em>maññanā</em> is and why it is
called an extremely subtle bondage of Māra.</p>
<p>It might be recalled that while discussing the significance of the
<em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> we mentioned that the non-manifestative consciousness
described in that discourse does not partake of the earthiness of earth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn473-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn473">36</a></sup>
That is to say, it is not under the sway of the earth quality of earth.</p>
<p>In fact as many as thirteen out of the twenty-four concepts mentioned in the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> come up again in the <em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em>. The
implication therefore is that the non-manifestative consciousness is not subject
to the influence of any of those concepts. It does not take any of those
concepts as substantial or essential, and that is why it is beyond their power.</p>
<p>For the same reason it is called the non-manifestative consciousness.
Consciousness as a rule takes hold of some object or other. This consciousness,
however, is called non-manifestative in the sense that it is devoid of the
nature of grasping any such object. It finds no object worthy of grasping.</p>
<p>What we have discussed so far could perhaps be better appreciated in the light
of another important sutta in the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, namely the
<em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em>. A key to the moral behind this discourse is to be
found in the following dictum occurring in it:
<em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ abhinivesāya,</em>
“nothing is worth entering into dogmatically”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn474-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn474">37</a></sup></p>
<p>The word <em>abhinivesa</em>, suggestive of dogmatic adherence, literally means
‘entering into’. Now based on this idea we can bring in a relevant metaphor.</p>
<p>We happened to mention earlier that as far as concepts are concerned, the
<em>arahants</em> have no dogmatic adherence. Let us take, for instance, the concept of
‘a house’. <em>Arahants</em> also enter a house, but they do not enter into the concept
of ‘a house’. This statement might appear rather odd, but what we mean is that
one can enter a house without entering into the concept of ‘a house’.</p>
<p>Now leaving this as something of a riddle, let us try to analyse a certain fairy
tale-like episode in the <em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em>, somewhat as an interlude.</p>
<p>The main theme of the <em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em> is as follows: Once Sakka, the
king of the gods, came to see the Buddha when he was staying at Pubbārāma and
asked the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How does a monk attain deliverance by the complete destruction of craving?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quintessence of the Buddha’s brief reply to that question is the above
mentioned dictum,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ abhinivesāya,</em></p>
<p>“nothing is worth entering into dogmatically.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka rejoiced in this sermon approvingly and left. Venerable Mahā Moggallāna,
who was seated near the Buddha at that time, had the inquisitive thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did Sakka rejoice in this sermon having understood it, or did he rejoice
without understanding it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being curious to find this out he vanished from Pubbārāma and appeared in the
Tāvatiṁsa heaven as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm and
bend back his outstretched arm.</p>
<p>At that time Sakka was enjoying heavenly music. On seeing Venerable Mahā
Moggallāna coming at a distance he stopped the music and welcomed the latter,
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Come good sir Moggallāna, welcome good sir Moggallāna! It is a long time,
good sir Moggallāna, since you found an opportunity to come here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered a high seat to Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and took a low seat at one
side. Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked Sakka what sort of a sermon the
Buddha had preached to him on his recent visit, saying that he himself is
curious on listening to it.</p>
<p>Sakka’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good sir Moggallāna, we are so busy, we have so much to do, not only with our
own business, but also with the business of other gods of Tāvatiṁsa. So it is
not easy for us to remember such Dhamma discussions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Sakka goes on to relate some other episode, which to him seems more
important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After winning the war against the <em>asuras</em>, I had the Vejayanti palace built.
Would you like to see it, good sir Moggallāna?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably as a part of etiquette, binding on a visitor, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna
agreed and Sakka conducted him around the Vejayanti palace in the company of his
friend, king Vessavaṇa. It was a wonderful palace with hundreds of towers.
Sakka’s maids, seeing Venerable Mahā Moggallāna coming in the distance, were
embarrassed out of modest respect and went into their rooms. Sakka was taking
Venerable Mahā Moggallāna around, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See, good sir, how lovely this palace is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Mahā Moggallāna also courteously responded, saying that it is a
fitting gift for his past merit. But then he thought of arousing a sense of
urgency in Sakka, seeing how negligent he has become now. And what did he do? He
shook the Vejayanti palace with the point of his toe, using his supernormal
power.</p>
<p>Since Sakka had ‘entered into’ the Vejayanti palace with his craving, conceit
and views, he also was thoroughly shaken, along with the palace. That is to say,
a sense of urgency was aroused in him, so much so that he remembered the sermon
the Buddha had preached to him.</p>
<p>It was then that Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked Sakka pointedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How did the Exalted One state to you in brief the deliverance through the
destruction of craving?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka came out with the full account, creditably.</p>
<p>So after all it seems that the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna took all this trouble
to drive home into Sakka the moral of the sermon <em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ
abhinivesāya</em>, “nothing is worth clinging onto”.</p>
<p>If one goes through this discourse ignoring the deeper aspects of it, it appears
merely as a fairy tale. Even as those heavenly maidens entered their rooms,
Sakka also had entered into this Vejayanti palace of his own creation, while
showing his distinguished visitor around, like a rich man these days after
building his mansion.</p>
<p>So from this we can see the nature of these worldly concepts. For instance, in
the case of the concept of ‘a house’, entering the house physically does not
necessarily mean that one is ‘in it’. Only if one has entered into the concept
of a house is he ‘in it’.</p>
<p>Let us take a simply analogy. Little children sometimes build a little hut, out
of fun, with a few sticks and shady leaves. They might even invite their mother
for the house-warming. When the mother creeps into the improvised hut, she does
not seriously entertain the concept of ‘a house’ in it, as the children
would do.</p>
<p>It is the same in the case of Buddhas and <em>arahants.</em> To the Emancipated Ones,
who have fully understood and comprehended the true meaning of concepts like
‘house’, ‘mansion’ and ‘palace’, the sandcastles of adults appear no better than
the playthings of little children. We have to grant it, therefore, that
<em>tathāgatas</em>, or Such-like Ones, cannot help making use of concepts in worldly
usage.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, once a certain deity even raised the question whether the
emancipated <em>arahant</em> monks, when they use such expressions as ‘I speak’ and
‘they speak to me’, do so out of conceit. The Buddha’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo hoti bhikkhu arahaṁ katāvī,</em> <br />
<em>khīṇāsavo antimadehadhārī,</em> <br />
<em>’ahaṁ vadāmī’ti pi so vadeyya,</em> <br />
<em>’mamaṁ vadantī’ti pi so vadeyya</em> <br />
<em>loke samaññaṁ kusalo viditvā,</em> <br />
<em>vohāramattena so vohareyyā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn475-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn475">38</a></sup></p>
<p>That monk, who is an <em>arahant,</em> who has finished his task, <br />
Whose influxes are extinct and who bears his final body, <br />
Might still say ‘I speak’, <br />
He might also say ‘they speak to me’, <br />
Being skilful, knowing the world’s parlance, <br />
He uses such terms merely as a convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of an <em>arahant</em>, who has accomplished his task and is influx-free, a
concept like ‘house’, ‘mansion’, or ‘palace’ has no influence by way of craving,
conceit and views. He might say ‘I speak’ or ‘I preach’, he might even say ‘they
speak to me’, but since he has understood the nature of worldly parlance, he
uses such expressions as mere turns of speech. Therefore the Buddhas and
<em>arahants</em>, though they may enter a house, do not entertain the concept of ‘a
house’ in it.</p>
<p>Some might think that in order to destroy the concept of ‘a house’, one has to
break up the tiles and bricks into atoms. But that is not the way to
deliverance. One has to understand according to the law of dependent arising
that not only is a house dependent on tiles and bricks, but the tiles and bricks
are themselves dependent on a house. Very often philosophers forget about the
principle of relativity involved here.</p>
<p>Tiles and bricks are dependent on a house. This is a point worth considering.
One might think that a house is made up of tiles and bricks, but tiles and
bricks themselves come to be because of a house. There is a mutual relationship
between them.</p>
<p>If one raises the question: “What is a tile?”, the answer will be: “It is an
item used for building the roof of a house”. Likewise a brick is an item used in
building a wall. This shows the relativity between a house and a tile as well as
between a house and a brick. So there is no need to get down to an atomistic
analysis like nuclear physicists. Wisdom is something that enables one to see
this relativity penetratively, then and there.</p>
<p>Today we happened to discuss some deep sections of the Dhamma, particularly on
the subject of <em>maññanā</em>. A reappraisal of some of the deep suttas preached by
the Buddha, now relegated into the background as those dealing with conventional
truth, will be greatly helpful in dispelling the obsessions created by
<em>maññanā</em>. What the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> offers in this respect is of utmost
importance.</p>
<p>In fact, the Buddha never used a language totally different from the language of
the worldlings. Now, for instance, chemists make use of a certain system of
symbolic formulas in their laboratories, but back at home they revert to another
set of symbols. However, both are symbols. There is no need to discriminate
between them as higher or lower, so long as they serve the purpose at hand.</p>
<p>Therefore it is not proper to relegate some sermons as discursive or
conventional in style. Always it is a case of using concepts in worldly
parlance. In the laboratory one uses a particular set of symbols, but on
returning home he uses another. In the same way, it is not possible to earmark a
particular bundle of concepts as absolute and unchangeable.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em>, already discussed, all these concepts are
worldly appellations, worldly expressions, worldly usages, worldly designations,
which the Tathāgata makes use of without tenacious grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn476-1"><a href="sermon-13.html#fn-fn476">39</a></sup> However
philosophical or technical the terminology may be, the <em>arahants</em> make use of it
without grasping it tenaciously.</p>
<p>What is of importance is the function it fulfils. We should make use of the
conceptual scaffolding only for the purpose of putting up the building. As the
building comes up, the scaffolding has to leave. It has to be dismantled. If one
simply clings onto the scaffolding, the building would never come up.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the fourteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we gave a description of the forms of imaginings or
methinkings, which the Buddha had compared to an extremely subtle bondage of
Māra.</p>
<p>The <em>Yavakalāpisutta</em> of the <em>Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> has
shown us that all kinds of thoughts concerning existence that stem from this
subtle conceit ‘am’, <em>asmimāna</em>, are mere imaginings or methinkings, and that
they are called a bondage of Māra, because they have the power to keep beings
shackled to existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn478-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn478">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We have seen how they follow a dichotomy, even like the dilemma posed by the
fivefold bondage of Vepacitti, the king of demons. Whether one thinks ‘I shall
be’ or ‘I shall not be’, one is in bondage to Māra. Whether one thinks ‘I shall
be percipient’ or ‘I shall be non-percipient’, or ‘I shall be
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’, one is still in bondage to Māra.</p>
<p>There is a dichotomy involved here. The fact that these imaginings, which follow
a dichotomy, must be transcended completely, as well as the way to transcend
them, has been preached by the Buddha to Venerable Pukkusāti in the
<em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>There is a pithy passage, forming the grand finale of this discourse, in which
the Buddha gives a resume. We propose to quote this passage at the very outset
as it scintillates with a majestic fervour of the Dhamma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti, maññussave kho pana nappavattamāne
muni santo ti vuccatīti, iti kho pan’etaṁ vuttaṁ. Kiñ c’etaṁ paṭicca vuttaṁ?</em></p>
<p><em>Asmīti bhikkhu maññitam etaṁ, ayam aham asmīti maññitam etaṁ, bhavissan’ti
maññitam etaṁ, na bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ, rūpī bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ,
arūpī bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ, saññī bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ, asaññī
bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ, nevasaññīnāsaññī bhavissan’ti maññitam etaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Maññitaṁ, bhikkhu, rogo, maññitaṁ gaṇḍo, maññitaṁ sallaṁ. Sabbamaññitānaṁ
tveva, bhikkhu, samatikkamā muni santo ti vuccati.</em></p>
<p><em>Muni kho pana, bhikkhu, santo na jāyati na jiyyati na miyyati na kuppati na
piheti. Tam pi’ssa bhikkhu natthi yena jāyetha, ajāyamāno kiṁ jiyyissati,
ajiyyamāno kiṁ miyyissati, amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati, akuppamāno kissa
pihessati?</em></p>
<p><em>Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti, maññussave kho pana nappavattamāne
muni santo ti vuccatīti, iti yaṁ taṁ vuttaṁ, idam etaṁ paṭicca
vuttaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn479-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn479">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> we find the Buddha presenting some points as the
theme and gradually developing it, analysing, clarifying, and expatiating, as
the discourse proceeds. The opening sentence in the above paragraph is a
quotation of a part of that original statement of the Buddha, which forms the
theme. Here is the rendering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Steadied whereon the tides of imaginings no longer occur in him, and when the
tides of imaginings occur no more in him, he is called a sage stilled’, so it
was said. And with reference to what was this said?</p>
<p>‘Am’, monk, is something imagined; ‘I am this’ is something imagined; ‘I shall
be’ is something imagined; ‘I shall not be’ is something imagined; ‘I shall be
possessed of form’ is something imagined; ‘I shall be formless’ is something
imagined; ‘I shall be percipient’ is something imagined; ‘I shall be
non-percipient’ is something imagined; ‘I shall be
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is something imagined.</p>
<p>The imagined is a disease, the imagined is an abscess, the imagined is a dart.
It is with the surmounting of all what is imagined, monk, that a sage is
called ‘stilled’.</p>
<p>The sage who is stilled is not born, nor does he age, nor does he die, nor is
he shaken, and he has no longing. Even that is not in him whereby he might be
born. Not being born, how shall he age? Not aging, how shall he die? Not
dying, how shall he be shaken? Being unshaken, what shall he long for?</p>
<p>So it was with reference to this, that it was said ‘steadied whereon the tides
of imaginings no longer occur in him, and when the tides of imagining occur no
more in him, he is called a sage stilled’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this goes to show how relevant the question of imaginings is to the path
leading to Nibbāna. This pithy passage, which brings the discourse to a climax,
portrays how the sage is at peace when his mind is released by stemming the
tides of imaginings. He attains release from birth, decay and death, here and
now, because he has realized the cessation of existence in this very world.</p>
<p>It is in this light that we have to interpret the above statement “even that is
not in him whereby he might be born”.</p>
<p>Dependent on existence is birth. Due to whatever postulate of existence one can
speak of a ‘birth’, even that existence is not in him. Not being born, how can
he age? How can he grow old or decay? This is because of the implicit
interrelation between conditions.</p>
<p>Here we can flash back to our analogy of a tree, mentioned earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn480-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn480">4</a></sup> In
order to explain the mutual interrelation between the concepts of birth, decay
and death, we brought up a simile, which however is not canonical. That is to
say, supposing there is some kind of a tree, the buds, the leaves, the flowers,
the fruits and the wood of which could be sold for making one’s livelihood.</p>
<p>If five men trading in those items respectively are made to line up at some
particular stage in the growth of this tree and asked whether the tree is too
young or too old, the answers given might differ according to the individual
standpoint grasped in each case.</p>
<p>It turns out to be a difference of viewpoint. For instance, the man who makes
his living by selling the buds would reply that the tree is too old when the
buds turn into leaves. Similarly, when it is the season for the leaves to fall
and the flowers to bloom, one who trades in leaves might say that the tree is
too old. And when flowers turn into fruits, the florist’s viewpoint would be
similar. In this way one can understand how this concept changes according to
what one grasps – that there is an implicit relativity about it.</p>
<p>Now, as for this sage, he has given up everything that he had grasped. Grasping
has been given up completely. Imagining, too, has been abandoned. Hence, not
being ‘born’, how shall he age? The sage has no postulate of existence. Since
there is no existence, there is no ‘birth’. Because there is no birth, there is
no decay.</p>
<p>It is a well known fact that the term <em>jarā</em> implies both growth and decay. It
is after setting a limit that we speak of a process of ‘decay’, after ‘growth’.
This limit, however, varies according to our individual standpoint grasped –
according to our point of view. That is what we have tried to illustrate by this
analogy.</p>
<p>Then we have the statement “not aging, how shall he die?” Since decay is an
approach to death, where there is no decay, there is no death. The fact that
there is no death we have already seen in our exposition of the significance of
the verses quoted above from the <em>Adhimutta Theragāthā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn481-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn481">5</a></sup> When the
bandits got round to kill the Venerable Adhimutta, he declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na me hoti ahosin’ti,</em> <br />
<em>bhavissan’ti na hoti me,</em> <br />
<em>saṅkhārā vibhavissanti,</em> <br />
<em>tattha kā paridevanā?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn482-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn482">6</a></sup></p>
<p>It does not occur to me ‘I was’, <br />
Nor does it occur to me ‘I shall be’, <br />
Mere preparations will get destroyed, <br />
What is there to lament?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declaration exemplifies the above statement. When all graspings are given
up, there is no ‘decay’ or ‘death’.</p>
<p><em>Amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati,</em> “not dying, how shall he be shaken?” The verb
<em>kuppati</em> does not necessarily mean ‘getting annoyed’. Here it means to be
‘shaken up’ or ‘moved’. When one holds on to a standpoint, one gets shaken up if
someone else tries to dislodge him from that standpoint.</p>
<p>The deliverance in Nibbāna is called <em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>, the unshakeable
deliverance of the mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn483-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn483">7</a></sup> All other deliverances of the mind, known to
the world, are shakeable, <em>kuppa</em>. They are unsteady. They shake before the pain
of death. Only Nibbāna is called <em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>, the unshakeable
deliverance of the mind.</p>
<p>So this peaceful sage, the <em>arahant</em>, established in that concentration of the
fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>, <em>arahatta phalasamādhi</em>, which is known as the
influx-free deliverance of the mind, <em>anāsavā cetovimutti</em>, and is endowed with
the wisdom proper to <em>arahanthood</em>, <em>paññāvimutti</em>, ‘deliverance through
wisdom’, is unshaken before death. His mind remains unshaken. That is why the
<em>arahant</em> Thera Venerable Adhimutta fearlessly made the above declaration to the
bandits.</p>
<p>Now as to the significance of the Buddha’s statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati, akuppamāno kissa pihessati,</em></p>
<p>not dying, how shall he be shaken, and being unshaken, what shall he long
for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When there is no shock, no agitation or trembling, what does one long for?
<em>Pihā</em> means longing, desiring for something or other. In this context it refers
to that longing which arises at the moment of death in one who has not destroyed
craving.</p>
<p>It is as a consequence of that longing that he enters some form of existence,
according to his <em>kamma</em>. That longing is not there in this sage, for the simple
reason that he is unshaken before death. He has nothing to look forward to. No
desires or longings. <em>Akuppamāno kissa pihessati</em>, “being unshaken, what shall
he long for?”</p>
<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the concepts of birth, decay and death become
meaningless to this sage. That is precisely why he is at peace, having
transcended all imaginings.</p>
<p>All this goes to show, that Nibbāna is a state beyond decay and death. We can
clearly understand from this discourse why Nibbāna is known as a decayless,
deathless state, realizable in this very world. That sage has conquered decay
and death here and now, because he has realized the cessation of existence, here
and now.</p>
<p>This is something extremely wonderful about the <em>arahant</em>. He realizes the
cessation of existence in his attainment to the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>. How does
he come to realize the cessation of existence? Craving is extinct in him, hence
there is no grasping. Where there is no grasping, there is no existence. Because
there is no existence, birth, decay and death, along with sorrow and
lamentation, cease altogether.</p>
<p>From the foregoing we could well infer that all those concepts like birth,
decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, come about as a
result of a heap of pervert perceptions, pervert thoughts and pervert views,
based on the conceit of an existence, the conceit ‘am’.</p>
<p>These three kinds of perversions known as <em>saññāvipallāsa</em>, <em>cittavipallāsa</em> and
<em>diṭṭhivipallāsa</em> give rise to a mass of concepts of an imaginary
nature.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn484-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn484">8</a></sup> The entire mass of suffering, summed up by the terms birth,
decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, are basically of a
mental origin.</p>
<p>For an illustration of this fact, we can go back to our analogy of winding some
strands into a rope, mentioned earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn485-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn485">9</a></sup> We pointed out that in the case
of some strands that are being mistakenly wound in the same direction, it is the
grasp in the middle that gives at least a semblance of a rope to it. So long as
there is no such grasping, the strands do not become knotty or tense, as they go
round and round.</p>
<p>It is only when someone grasps it in the middle that the strands begin to get
winded up, knotty and tense. What is called existence, or becoming, <em>bhava</em>,
follows the same norm.</p>
<p>True to the law of impermanence, everything in the world changes. But there is
something innocent in this change. Impermanence is innocuous in itself. We say
it is innocuous because it means no harm to anyone. It is simply the nature of
this world, the suchness, the norm. It can do us harm only when we grasp, just
as in the case of that quasi rope.</p>
<p>The tenseness between winding and unwinding, arising out of that grasp in the
middle, is comparable to what is called <em>bhavasaṅkhāra</em>, ‘preparations for
existence’. <em>Saṅkhārā</em>, or preparations, are said to be dependent on <em>avijjā</em>,
or ignorance.</p>
<p>Now we can form an idea of the relationship between these two even from this
analogy of the rope. The grasp in the middle creates two ends, giving rise to a
dilemma. In the case of existence, too, grasping leads to an antinomian
conflict. To become a thing, is to disintegrate into another thing.</p>
<p>On a previous occasion we happened to discuss the significance of the term
<em>maññanā</em>, me-thinking or imagining, with reference to the verse:</p>
<p><em>Yena yena hi
maññati, tato taṁ hoti aññathā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn486-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn486">10</a></sup> <em>Maññanā</em> itself gives rise to a
‘thing’, which from its very inception goes on disintegrating into another
thing.</p>
<p>Just as much as grasping leads to the concept of two ends, to become a thing is
to start changing into another thing, that is, it comes under the sway of the
law of impermanence. Illustrations of this norm are sometimes to be met with in
the discourses, but their significance is often ignored.</p>
<p>The idea of the two ends and the middle sometimes finds expression in references
to an ‘above’, ‘below’ and ‘across in the middle’, <em>uddhaṁ, adho, tiriyaṁ
majjjhe</em>; or in the terms ‘before’, ‘behind’ and ‘middle’, <em>pure, pacchā,
majjhe</em>. Such references deal with some deep aspects of the Dhamma, relating to
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>As a good illustration, we may take up the following two verses from the
<em>Mettagūmāṇavapucchā</em> in the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci sampajānāsi,</em> <br />
<em>uddhaṁ adho tiriyaṁ cāpi majjhe,</em> <br />
<em>etesu nandiñca nivesanañca</em> <br />
<em>panujja viññāṇaṁ bhave na tiṭṭhe.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ vihārī sato appamatto,</em> <br />
<em>bhikkhu caraṁ hitvā mamāyitāni,</em> <br />
<em>jātijaraṁ sokapariddavañca</em> <br />
<em>idh’eva vidvā pajaheyya dukkhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn487-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn487">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever you may know to be <br />
Above, below and across in the middle, <br />
Dispel the delight and the tendency to dwell in them, <br />
Then your consciousness will not remain in existence.</p>
<p>A monk, endowed with understanding, <br />
Thus dwelling mindful and heedful, <br />
As he fares along giving up all possessions, <br />
Would abandon even here and now <br />
Birth, decay, sorrow, lamentation and suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>idh’eva</em> occurring in the second verse is highly significant, in that
it means the abandonment of all those things here and now, not leaving it for an
existence to come.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mahāviyūhasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> also a similar emphasis is laid
on this idea of ‘here and now’. About the <em>arahant</em> it is said that he has no
death or birth here and now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cutūpapāto idha yassa natthi,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn488-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn488">12</a></sup></p>
<p>to whom, even here, there is no death or birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this very world he has transcended them by making those two concepts
meaningless.</p>
<p>The word <em>nivesanaṁ</em>, occurring in the first verse, is also significant. It
means ‘dwelling’. In consciousness there is a tendency to ‘dwell in’. That is
why in some contexts it is said that form is the abode or dwelling place of
consciousness,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>rūpadhātu kho, gahapati, viññāṇassa oko,</em></p>
<p>the form element, householder, is the abode of consciousness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn489-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn489">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terms <em>oka, niketa</em> and <em>nivesana</em> are synonymous, meaning ‘abode’, ‘home’,
or ‘dwelling place’.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness in general is to abide or dwell in. That
non-manifestative consciousness, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>, however, has got rid of
the tendency to abide or dwell in.</p>
<p>Now we can revert to the passage in the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>, which speaks of an
occurrence of tides of imaginings. The passage actually begins with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti</em>,</p>
<p>steadied whereon the tides of imaginings occur no more in him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind this occurrence of tides of imaginings is quite often
represented by the concept of <em>āsava</em>, influx. Sensuality, <em>kāma</em>, existence,
<em>bhava</em>, views, <em>diṭṭhi</em> and ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, are referred to as ‘influxes’,
<em>āsavā</em>, or ‘floods’, <em>oghā</em>. These are the four kinds of <em>saṁsāric</em> habits that
continuously flow into the minds of beings.</p>
<p>The above mentioned sutta passage refers to a place steadied whereon the tides
of imaginings do not occur or flow in, a place that is free from their
‘influence’. This is none other than Nibbāna, for which one of the epithets used
is <em>dīpa</em>, or island.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn490-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn490">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Since Nibbāna is called an island, some might take it literally to mean some
sort of a place in this world. In fact, this is the general concept of Nibbāna
some are prone to uphold in their interpretation of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>But why it is called an island is clearly explained for us by a discourse in the
<em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, namely the <em>Kappamāṇavapucchā</em>. In this
sutta, the Brahmin youth Kappa poses the following question to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ</em> <br />
<em>oghe jāte mahabbhaye</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparetānaṁ</em> <br />
<em>dīpaṁ pabrūhi, mārisa.</em> <br />
<em>Tvañca me dīpam akkhāhi</em> <br />
<em>yathayidaṁ nāparaṁ siyā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn491-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn491">15</a></sup></p>
<p>To them that stand midstream, <br />
When the frightful floods flow forth, <br />
To them in decay and death forlorn, <br />
An island, sire, may you proclaim. <br />
An island which none else excels, <br />
Yea, such an isle, pray tell me sire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the Buddha’s reply to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ dīpaṁ anāparaṁ</em> <br />
<em>‘nibbānam’ iti naṁ brūmi</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn492-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn492">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Owning naught, grasping naught, <br />
The isle is this, none else besides, <br />
Nibbāna – that is how I call that isle, <br />
Wherein Decay is decayed and Death is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s reply makes it clear that the term Nibbāna stands for the
extinction of craving and grasping. The ideal of owning naught and grasping
naught is itself Nibbāna, and nothing else. If the term had any other
connotation, the Buddha would have mentioned it in this context.</p>
<p>It is indubitably clear, then, that the epithet <em>dīpaṁ</em>, or island, has to be
understood in a deeper sense when it refers to Nibbāna. It is that owning
nothing and grasping nothing, that puts an end to decay and death.</p>
<p>Though we have yet to finish the discussion of the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>, the
stage is already set now to understand the significance of a certain brief
discourse in the <em>Udāna</em>, which is very often quoted in discussions on Nibbāna.
For facility of understanding, we shall take it up now, as it somehow fits into
the context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi, bhikkhave, ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ. No ce taṁ, bhikkhave,
abhavissa ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ, nayidha jātassa bhūtassa katassa
saṅkhatassa nissaraṇaṁ paññāyetha. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, atthi ajātaṁ
abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ, tasmā jātassa bhūtassa katassa saṅkhatassa
nissaraṇaṁ paññāyati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn493-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn493">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there is a not-born, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded. Monks,
if that not-born, not-become, not-made, not-compounded were not, there would
be no stepping out here from what is born, become, made and compounded. But
since, monks, there is a not-born, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded,
therefore there is a stepping out from what is born, become, made and
compounded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terms <em>ajātaṁ</em>, not-born, <em>abhūtaṁ</em>, not-become, <em>akataṁ</em>, not-made, and
<em>asaṅkhataṁ</em>, not-compounded, are all epithets for Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The Buddha declares that if not for this not-born, not-become, not-made,
not-compounded, there would be no possibility of stepping out or release here,
that is, in this very world, from the born, the become, the made and the
compounded.</p>
<p>The second half of the passage rhetorically reiterates and emphasises the same
fact. Now as to the significance of this profound declaration of the Buddha, we
may point out that the terms not-born, not-become, not-made, not-compounded,
suggest the emancipation of the <em>arahant’s</em> mind from birth, becoming and
preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>. They refer to the cessation of birth, becoming and
preparations realized by the <em>arahant</em>. So then the significance of these terms
is purely psychological.</p>
<p>But the commentator, the Venerable Dhammapāla, pays little attention to the word
<em>idha</em>, ‘here’, in this passage, which needs to be emphasized.</p>
<p>The fact that there is a possibility here and now, of stepping out from the
state of being born, become, made and compounded, surely deserves emphasis,
since, until then, release from decay and death was thought to be possible only
in another dimension of existence, that is, after death.</p>
<p>The prospect of stepping out from decay and death here and now in this very
world has to be asserted for its novelty, which is why the declaration opens
with the word <em>atthi</em>, ‘there is’.</p>
<p>However, most of the scholars who tried to interpret this passage in their
discussion on Nibbāna, instead of laying stress on the word <em>idha,</em> ‘here’,
emphasize the opening word <em>atthi</em>, ‘there is’, to prove that Nibbāna is some
form of reality absolutely existing somewhere.</p>
<p>As that passage from the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> on <em>maññanā</em>, which we discussed,
has shown us, the terms <em>ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ</em> and <em>asaṅkhataṁ</em> have to be
understood in a deeper sense.</p>
<p>Existence is a conceit deep rooted in the mind, which gives rise to a heap of
pervert notions. Its cessation, therefore, has also to be accomplished in the
mind and by the mind. This is the gist of the Buddha’s exhortation.</p>
<p>Let us now come back to the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> to discuss another facet of it.
We started our discussion with the grand finale of that discourse, because of
its relevance to the question of <em>maññanā</em>.</p>
<p>However, as a matter of fact, this discourse preached by the Buddha to the
Venerable Pukkusāti is an exposition of a systematic path of practice for the
emancipation of the mind from imaginings or <em>maññanā</em>.</p>
<p>The discourse begins with the declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>chadhāturo ayaṁ, bhikkhu, puriso</em></p>
<p>monk, man as such is a combination of six elements.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn494-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn494">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worldling thinks that a being, <em>satta</em> (Sanskrit <em>sattva</em>), exists at a
higher level of reality than inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Now what did the Buddha do to explode this concept of a being in his discourse
to Venerable Pukkusāti? He literally thrashed out that concept, by breaking up
this ‘man’ into his basic elements and defining him as a bundle of six elements,
namely earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness.</p>
<p>As the discourse proceeds, he explains in an extremely lucid manner how one can
detach one’s mind from each of these elements. We happened to mention at the
very outset that the depth of the Dhamma has to be seen through lucidity and not
through complicated over-drawings. In fact, this discourse exhibits such
lucidity.</p>
<p>The meditation subject of elements, which grew in complexity at the hands of
later Buddhist philosophers, who took to atomistic analysis of a speculative
sort, is presented here in this <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> with a refreshing clarity
and lucidity. Here it is explained in such a way that one can directly
experience it.</p>
<p>For instance in describing the earth element, the Buddha gives as examples of
the internal earth element such parts of the body as head hairs, body hairs,
nails and teeth. Because the external earth element hardly needs illustration,
nothing in particular has been mentioned as to that aspect. Anyone can easily
understand what is meant by it. There is no attempt at atomistic analysis.</p>
<p>However, the Buddha draws special attention to a certain first principle of great significance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā c’eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu, yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu,
paṭhavīdhātur ev’esā. Taṁ netaṁ mama, neso ’ham asmi, na me so attā ti evam
etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ. Evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
disvā paṭhavīdhātuyā nibbindati, paṭhavīdhātuyā cittaṁ virājeti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn495-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn495">19</a></sup></p>
<p>That which is the internal earth element, and that which is the external earth
element, they are both just the earth element itself. And that should be seen
as it is with right wisdom, thus: ‘this is not mine’, ‘I am not this’, ‘this
is not my self’. Having seen thus with right wisdom as it is, he becomes
dejected with the earth element, he detaches his mind from the earth element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this first principle that is truly important and not any kind of atomic
theory. This resolution of the internal/external conflict has in it the secret
of stopping the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex of reiterated becoming, <em>saṁsāravaṭṭa</em>. It is
due to the very discrimination between an ‘internal’ and an ‘external’ that this
<em>saṁsāric</em> vortex is kept going.</p>
<p>Now in the case of a vortex, what is found inside and outside is simply water.
But all the same there is such a vehement speed and activity and a volley of
changes going on there.</p>
<p>So it is the case with this ‘man’. What is found in his body is the earth
element. What is to be found outside is also the earth element. And yet, the
ordinary person sees quite a wide disparity between the two. Why is that? That
is because of the illusory nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>We have devoted a number of sermons to explain the relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form. We happened to speak of name-and-form as a
reflection or a self-image.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn496-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn496">20</a></sup> Even as one who comes before a mirror, on
seeing his reflection on it, would say: ‘this is mine’, ‘this am I’, ‘this is my
self’, the worldling is in the habit of entertaining cravings, conceits and
views.</p>
<p>In fact the purpose of cravings, conceits and views is to reinforce the
distinction between an internal and an external. Already when one says ‘this is
mine’, one discriminates between the ‘this’ and ‘I’, taking them to be separate
realities. ‘This am I’ and ‘this is my self’ betray the same tacit assumption.</p>
<p>Just as by looking at a mirror one may like or dislike the image appearing on
it, these three points of view give rise to various pervert notions. All this
because of the perpetuation of the distinction between an internal and an
external, which is the situation with the ordinary worldling.</p>
<p>Since cravings, conceits and views thus reinforce the dichotomy between an
internal and an external, the Buddha has upheld this principle underlying the
meditation on the four elements, to resolve this conflict.</p>
<p>The fact that with the resolution of this conflict between the internal and the
external concerning the four elements the mind becomes emancipated is put across
to us in the following verse in the <em>Tālapuṭa Theragāthā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kadā nu kaṭṭhe ca tiṇe latā ca</em> <br />
<em>khandhe ime ‘haṁ amite ca dhamme</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattikān’ eva ca bāhirāni ca</em> <br />
<em>samaṁ tuleyyaṁ, tad idaṁ kadā me?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn497-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn497">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse gives expression to Venerable Tālapuṭa Thera’s aspiration to become
an <em>arahant</em>. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When shall I weigh as equal all these <br />
Limitless things both internal and external, <br />
Twigs, grass, creepers and these aggregates, <br />
O! when shall that be for me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is at the stage of <em>arahanthood</em> that the internal and the external appear
alike. That is precisely why the Venerable Adhimutta Thera, whom we quoted
earlier, uttered the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yadā paññāya passati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn498-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn498">22</a></sup></p>
<p>When one sees through wisdom, <br />
The world to be comparable to grass and twigs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comparison is between the internal world of the five aggregates, or this
conscious body, and the inanimate objects outside.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of the four elements earth, water, fire and air, the Buddha
pointed out a way of liberating one’s mind from the space element with the help
of similar illustrations. In explaining the space element, too, he gave easily
intelligible examples.</p>
<p>The internal space element is explained in terms of some apertures in the body
that are well known, namely those in the ears, nose and the mouth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn499-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn499">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from such instances, he did not speak of any microscopic space element, as
in scientific explanations, probably because it is irrelevant. Such an analysis
is irrelevant for this kind of reflection.</p>
<p>Here we have to bear in mind the fact that perception as such is a
mirage.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn500-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn500">24</a></sup> However far one may go on analysing, form and space are relative
to each other like a picture and its background. A picture is viewed against its
background, which is relative to it. So also are these two concepts of form and
space. Consciousness provides the framework for the entire picture.</p>
<p>By way of clarification we may allude to the pre-Buddhistic attempts of Yogins
to solve this problem, solely through the method of serenity, <em>samatha</em>,
ignoring the method of insight, <em>vipassanā</em>. The procedure they followed was
somewhat on these lines:</p>
<p>They would first of all surmount the concept of form or matter through the first
four mental absorptions, or <em>jhānas</em>. Then as they inclined towards the
formless, what confronted them first was space. A very appropriate illustration
in this context would be the method of removing the sign of the <em>kasiṇa</em> and
attending to the space left by that removal as ‘infinite’ or ‘boundless’, in
order to arouse the base of infinity of space.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn501-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn501">25</a></sup></p>
<p>This mode of contemplation of space betrays the fact that space is also
something made up, or prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>. Whatever is prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>, is
thought out and mind made, <em>abhisaṅkhataṁ abhisañcetayitaṁ.</em></p>
<p>The Buddha proclaimed that there is only one <em>asaṅkhata</em>, unprepared, that is
Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn502-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn502">26</a></sup> But later philosophers confounded the issue by taking space
also to be <em>asaṅkhata</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn503-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn503">27</a></sup> They seem to have ignored its relation to the
mind in regarding causes and conditions as purely external things.</p>
<p>Here we see the relativity between form and space. Like the picture and its
background, form and space stand relative to each other. All this is presented
to us by attention,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>manasikārasambhavā sabbe dhammā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn504-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn504">28</a></sup></p>
<p>all things originate from attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the later speculations about the nature of the space element are not in
consonance with the basic principles outlined in the Dhamma. Such confusion
arose probably due to a lack of understanding of the term <em>asaṅkhata</em>.</p>
<p>Now if we are to say something more about this particular discourse, what
remains after detaching one’s mind from these five elements, namely earth,
water, fire, air and space, is a consciousness that is extremely pure.</p>
<p>The basic function of consciousness is discrimination. It distinguishes between
the bitter and the sweet, for instance, to say: ‘this is bitter’, ‘this is
sweet’. Or else it distinguishes between the pleasant, the unpleasant and the
neutral with regard to feelings: ‘this is pleasant’, ‘this is unpleasant’, ‘this
is neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant’.</p>
<p>Now that the five elements earth, water, fire, air and space, which create
discrete objects as the outward manifestations of consciousness, have been
totally removed, the residual function of consciousness amounts to a
discrimination between the three grades of feelings.</p>
<p>The sage who has arrived at this stage of progress on the path to Nibbāna takes
the next step by observing these three kinds of feelings, pleasant, unpleasant
and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, as they arise and cease dependent on
specific contacts, thereby gradually bringing the mind to equanimity.</p>
<p>He brings his mind to a stage of radiant equanimity. But even this equanimity he
does not grasp by way of me-thinking or imagining. The phrase used in this
connection is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>visaṁyutto naṁ vedeti,</em></p>
<p>being detached he experiences it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn505-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn505">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a detachment, an aloofness, even in going through those sensations.
This is clearly expressed in that context.</p>
<p>For instance, in the case of a pleasant feeling, it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>aniccā ti pajānāti, anajjhositā ti pajānāti, anabhinanditā ti pajānāti,</em></p>
<p>he understands it to be impermanent, he understands it to be uninvolved, he
understands it to be unrejoiced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the understanding of impermanence, conceit goes down. The non-involvement
does away with the views. The absence of rejoicing suggests the extinction of
craving.</p>
<p>So the attainment of <em>arahanthood</em> is in effect the cessation of that
consciousness itself. That consciousness is divested of its most primary
function of discriminating between the three grades of feeling, pleasant,
unpleasant and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant.</p>
<p>The term <em>visaṁyutto</em> connotes disjunction, suggestive of dispassion and
detachment. In this way, the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> clearly brings out the
relevance of the question of <em>maññanā</em> to the path leading to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In some contexts, this practice of desisting from me-thinking or imagining is
called <em>atammayatā</em>, non-identification. This is the term used by the Buddha
throughout the <em>Sappurisasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. For instance we read
there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati:
nevasaññā-nāsaññāyatana-samāpattiyā pi kho atammayatā vuttā Bhagavatā. Yena yena
hi maññanti, tato taṁ hoti aññathā ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn506-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn506">30</a></sup></p>
<p>The good man reflects thus: the principle of non-identification has been
recommended by the Buddha even with regard to the attainment of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception thus: in whatever way they imagine about
it, thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘good man’ referred to here is the noble disciple on the supramundane path.</p>
<p>This term <em>tammaya</em> needs to be clarified in order to understand the
significance of this statement. It is derived from <em>tad</em> <em>maya</em>, literally ‘made
of that’ or ‘of that stuff’. It is on a par with such terms as <em>sovaṇṇamaya</em>,
golden, and <em>rajatamaya</em>, silvery.</p>
<p>When one has cravings, conceits and views about something, he practically
becomes one with it due to that very grasping. In other words, he identifies
himself with it. That is why the person who has imaginings about the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which he has attained, thinks “I am one
who has attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception”.</p>
<p>He thereby has conceit, which is a defilement in itself. As a result, when he
loses his mastery of that attainment, he becomes disconcerted. It is for that
reason that the Buddha had enjoined that one should cultivate the attitude of
<em>atammayatā</em>, or non-identification, even with regard to the attainment of the
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> is called <em>atammayo</em> in the sense that he does not identify
himself with anything. An <em>arahant</em> cannot be identified with what he appears to
possess. This is well expressed by the following verse in the <em>Devadūtavagga</em> of
the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pasayha Māraṁ abhibhuyya antakaṁ</em> <br />
<em>yo ca phusī jātikkhayaṁ padhānavā</em> <br />
<em>sa tādiso lokavidū sumedho</em> <br />
<em>sabbesu dhammesu atammayo muni.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn507-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn507">31</a></sup></p>
<p>That ardent sage who has touched the extinction of birth, <br />
Having overpowered Māra and conquered the Ender, <br />
That Such-like one, the wise sage, the knower of the world, <br />
Is aloof in regard to all phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of this aloofness can be presented in another way, that is as
detachment from the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized, <em>diṭṭha, suta,
muta, viññāta</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most important suttas that merits discussion in this respect is the
<em>Bāhiyasutta</em> in the <em>Bodhivagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>. It is generally acclaimed as
an extremely profound discourse.</p>
<p>The ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya came all the way from far off Suppāraka to see the
Buddha. When he reached Jetavana monastery at Sāvatthī, he heard that the Buddha
had just left on his alms-round. Due to his extreme eagerness, he ran behind the
Buddha and, on meeting him, fell prostrate before him and begged: “May the
Exalted One preach to me the Dhamma.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, however, seemed not so responsive, when he remarked: “Now it is
untimely, Bāhiya, we are on our alms-round.”</p>
<p>Some might be puzzled by this attitude of the Buddha. But most probably it is
one of those skilful means of the Buddha, suggestive of his great compassion and
wisdom. It served to tone down the overenthusiastic haste of Bāhiya and to
arouse a reverential respect for the Dhamma in him.</p>
<p>Bāhiya repeated his request for the second time, adding: “I do not know whether
there will be a danger to the Exalted One’s life or to my own life.” For the
second time the Buddha refused.</p>
<p>It was when Bāhiya made his request for the third time that the Buddha acceded
to it by giving a terse discourse, <em>saṅkhitta Dhammadesanā</em>, of extraordinary
depth. The exhortation, brief and deep as it is, was quite apt, since Bāhiya
Dārucīriya belonged to that rare category of persons with quick understanding,
<em>khippābhiññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn508-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn508">32</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha te, Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ: diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute
sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ
bhavissati. Evaṁ hi te, Bāhiya,, sikkhitabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Yato kho te, Bāhiya, diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ
bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati, tato
tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena. Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha.
Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev’idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantarena. Es’ev’anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn509-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn509">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sooner had the Buddha finished his exhortation, the ascetic Bāhiya attained
<em>arahanthood</em> then and there. Let us now try to unravel the meaning of this
abstruse discourse.</p>
<p>The discourse starts off abruptly, as if it had been wrested from the Buddha by
Bāhiya’s repeated requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>well then, Bāhiya, you had better train yourself thus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what is that training?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
be just the cognized. Thus, Bāhiya, should you train yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is as if the Buddha had addressed the ascetic Bāhiya in the terminology of
the <em>ariyans</em> and established him on the path to Nibbāna. Here the term <em>muta</em>,
or ‘sensed’, stands for whatever is experienced through the tongue, the nose,
and the body.</p>
<p>The basic principle in this training seems to be the discipline to stop short at
bare awareness, <em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ, sute sutamattaṁ</em>, etc. The latter half of
the discourse seems to indicate what happens when one goes through that
training. The entire discourse is a presentation of the triple training of
morality, concentration and wisdom in a nutshell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when to you, Bāhiya, there will be in the seen just the seen, in the heard
just the heard, in the sensed just the sensed, in the cognized just the
cognized, then, Bāhiya, you are not by it. And when you are not by it, you are
not in it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not in it, then, Bāhiya, you are neither
here, nor there, nor in between. This itself is the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a literal translation this appears cryptic enough to demand an explanation.
Let us first of all give a few clues to unravel the puzzle.</p>
<p>The terms ‘by it’, <em>tena</em>, and ‘in it’, <em>tattha</em>, are rather elliptical. Though
unexpressed, they seem to imply the relevance of <em>maññanā</em> to the whole problem.</p>
<p>As we happened to mention earlier, imaginings or methinkings by way of craving,
conceit and views, lead to an identification, for which the term used is
<em>tammayatā</em>. Such an identification makes one unsteady, for when the thing
identified with is shaken, one also gets shaken up.</p>
<p>This kind of imagining ‘in terms of’ is indicated by the elliptical <em>tena</em>, for
we get a clear proof of it in the following two lines from the <em>Jarāsutta</em> in
the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dhono na hi tena maññati</em> <br />
<em>yad idaṁ diṭṭhasutaṁ mutesu vā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn510-1"><a href="sermon-14.html#fn-fn510">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Dhona</em> is a term for the <em>arahant</em> as one who has ‘shaken off’ all defilements.
So these lines could be rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>arahant</em>, the one who has shaken off, <br />
Does not imagine ‘in terms of’ <br />
Whatever is seen, heard and sensed.</p>

<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the fifteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our last sermon we happened to quote a brief exhortation on
Dhamma from the <em>Udāna</em>, which enabled the ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya to liberate
his mind from imaginings and attain the state of non-identification,
<em>atammayatā</em>, or <em>arahanthood</em>. In order to attempt an exposition of that
exhortation of the Buddha, which was pithy enough to bring about instantaneous
<em>arahanthood</em>, let us refresh our memory of that brief discourse to Bāhiya.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha te, Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ: diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute
sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ
bhavissati. Evaṁ hi te, Bāhiya, sikkhitabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Yato kho te, Bāhiya, diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ
bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati, tato
tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena. Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha.
Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev’idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantarena. Es’ev’anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn512-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn512">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, then, Bāhiya, you had better train yourself thus: In the seen there will
be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the heard, in the sensed
there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will be just the
cognized. Thus, Bāhiya, should you train yourself.</p>
<p>And when to you, Bāhiya, there will be in the seen just the seen, in the heard
just the heard, in the sensed just the sensed, in the cognized just the
cognized, then, Bāhiya, you will not be by it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not
by it, then, Bāhiya, you are not in it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not in it,
then, Bāhiya, you are neither here nor there nor in between. This, itself, is
the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a clue to an exegesis of this discourse, we made an attempt, the other day,
to unravel the meaning of the two puzzling terms in the text, namely, <em>na tena</em>
and <em>na tattha</em>. These two terms are apparently unrelated to the context. To get
at their significance, we brought up a quotation of two lines from the
<em>Jarāsutta</em> of the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dhono na hi tena maññati</em> <br />
<em>yadidaṁ diṭṭhasutaṁ mutesu vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn513-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn513">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Dhona</em> is a term for the <em>arahant</em> in the sense that he has ‘shaken off’ the
dust of defilements. So then, these two lines imply that the <em>arahant</em> does not
imagine thereby, namely <em>yadidaṁ</em>, in terms of whatever is seen, heard or
sensed. These two lines are, as it were, a random exegesis of our riddle terms
in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>The first line itself gives the clue to the rather elliptical term <em>na tena</em>,
which carries no verb with it. Our quotation makes it clear that the implication
is <em>maññanā</em>, or imagining. <em>Dhono na hi tena maññati</em>, the <em>arahant</em> does not
imagine ‘by it’ or ‘thereby’.</p>
<p>Although the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> makes no mention of the word <em>maññanā</em>, this
particular expression seems to suggest that what is implied here is a form of
imagining.</p>
<p>By way of further proof we may allude to another quotation, which we had to
bring up several times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti, tato taṁ hoti aññathā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn514-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn514">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In whatever terms they imagine it, thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We came across another expression, which has a similar connotation: <em>tena ca mā
maññi,</em> “do not be vain thereby”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn515-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn515">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The first thing we can infer, therefore, from the above quoted two lines of the
verse, is that what is to be understood by the elliptical expression <em>na tena</em>
in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> is the idea of imagining, or in short, <em>na tena maññati</em>,
“does not imagine thereby”.</p>
<p>Secondly, as to what precisely is implied by the word <em>tena</em>, or ‘by it’, can
also be easily inferred from those two lines.</p>
<p>In fact, the second line beginning with the word <em>yadidaṁ</em>, which means ‘namely’
or ‘that is’, looks like a commentary on the first line itself. The <em>dhono</em>, or
the <em>arahant</em>, does not imagine ‘thereby’, namely by whatever is seen, heard and
sensed.</p>
<p>The verse in question mentions only the three terms <em>diṭṭha, suta</em> and <em>muta</em>,
whereas the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> has as its framework the four terms <em>diṭṭha, suta,
muta</em> and <em>viññata</em>. Since what precedes the term <em>na tena</em> in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>
is the fourfold premise beginning with <em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati</em>, “when
to you, Bāhiya, there will be in the seen just the seen”, it stands to reason
that what the Buddha meant by the term <em>na tena</em> is the attitude of not thinking
‘in terms of’ whatever is seen, heard, sensed or cognized. That is to say, not
imagining ‘thereby’.</p>
<p>This same attitude of not imagining ‘thereby’ is what is upheld in the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, which we discussed at length on a previous
occasion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn516-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn516">6</a></sup> There we explained the word <em>maññanā</em>, ‘me-thinking’,
‘imagining’, taking as a paradigm the first term <em>paṭhavi</em>, occurring in the
list of twenty-four terms given there. Among the twenty-four terms, we find
mentioned the four relevant to our present problem, namely <em>diṭṭha, suta, muta</em>
and <em>viññāta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn517-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn517">7</a></sup></p>
<p>We are now used to the general schema of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, concerning the
attitude of the three categories of persons mentioned there. Let us, for
instance, take up what is said in that context with regard to the <em>sekha</em>, or
the monk in higher training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ mā maññi, paṭhaviyā mā maññi, paṭhavito
mā maññi, paṭhaviṁ me ti mā maññi, paṭhaviṁ mā abhinandi.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how the attitude of the <em>sekha</em> is described with regard to <em>paṭhavi</em>,
or earth. Suppose we substitute <em>diṭṭha</em>, or the seen, in place of <em>paṭhavi</em>.
This is what we should get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhaṁ diṭṭhato abhiññāya diṭṭhaṁ mā maññi, diṭṭhasmiṁ mā maññi, diṭṭhato mā
maññi, diṭṭhaṁ me ti mā maññi, diṭṭhaṁ mā abhinandi.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the <em>sekha</em> has before him is a step of training, and this is how he has to
train in respect of the four things, the seen, the heard, the sensed and the
cognized. He should not imagine in terms of them.</p>
<p>For instance, he understands through higher knowledge, and not through the
ordinary perception of the worldling, the seen as ‘seen’. Having thus understood
it, he has to train in not imagining the seen as a thing, by objectifying it.
<em>Diṭṭhaṁ mā maññi</em>, let him not imagine a ‘seen’. Also, let him not imagine ‘in
the seen’, or ‘from the seen’. We have already pointed out the relationship
between these imaginings and the grammatical structure.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn518-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn518">8</a></sup></p>
<p>This objectification of the seen gives rise to acquisitive tendencies, to
imagine the seen as ‘mine’. <em>Diṭṭhaṁ me ti mā maññi,</em> let him not imagine ‘I
have seen’ or ‘I have a seen’.</p>
<p>This acquisition has something congratulatory about it. It leads to some sort of
joy, so the monk in higher training has to combat that too. <em>Diṭṭhaṁ mā
abhinandi</em>, let him not delight in the seen.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that the Buddha has addressed the ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya in
the language of the <em>ariyans</em>, for the very first instruction given to him was
“in the seen there will be just the seen”. So highly developed in wisdom and
quick witted was <em>Bāhiya</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn519-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn519">9</a></sup> that the Buddha promptly asked him to stop
short at the seen, by understanding that in the seen there is just the seen.</p>
<p>Not to have imaginings or me-thinkings about the seen is therefore the way to
stop short at just the seen. If one does not stop short at just the seen, but
goes on imagining in terms of ‘in the seen’, ‘from the seen’, etc., as already
stated, one will end up with an identification, or <em>tammayatā</em>.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we brought up the term <em>tammayatā</em>. When one starts imagining
in such terms about something, one tends to become one with it, <em>tammayo</em>, even
as things made out of gold and silver are called golden, <em>suvaṇṇamaya</em>, and
silvery, <em>rajatamaya</em>. It is as if one who grasps a gem becomes its owner and if
anything happens to the gem he is affected by it. To possess a gem is to be
possessed by it.</p>
<p>When one gets attached and becomes involved and entangled in the seen through
craving, conceit and views, by imagining egoistically, the result is
identification, <em>tammayatā</em>, literally ‘of-that-ness’.</p>
<p>In this present context, however, the Buddha puts Bāhiya Dārucīriya on the path
to non-identification, or <em>atammayatā</em>. That is to say, he advises Bāhiya not to
indulge in such imaginings. That attitude leads to non-identification and
detachment. When one has no attachments, involvements and entanglements
regarding the seen, one does not have the notion of being in the seen.</p>
<p>Once we spoke about a children’s hut into which the mother was invited.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn520-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn520">10</a></sup>
When she crept into that plaything of a hut, she did not seriously entertain the
thought of being ‘in’ it. Similarly if one does not indulge in imaginings, one
has no notion of being ‘in’ the seen.</p>
<p>This, then, is the significance of the words <em>na tattha</em>, ‘not in it’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha.</em></p>
<p>When, Bāhiya, you are not by it, then, Bāhiya, you are not in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, when for instance Bāhiya does not imagine ‘by the seen’, he is
not ‘in the seen’. Likewise, he is not in the heard, sensed or cognized. From
this we can deduce the meaning of what follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev’idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantarena</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At whatever moment you neither imagine ‘by the seen’ nor entertain the notion of
being ‘in the seen’, which is tantamount to projecting an ‘I’ into the seen,
then you are neither here nor there nor in between.</p>
<p>In a number of earlier sermons we have sufficiently explained the significance
of the two ends and the middle as well as the above, the below and the across in
the middle. What do they signify?</p>
<p>As we happened to point out on an earlier occasion, it is by driving the peg of
the conceit ‘am’ that a world is measured out, construed or postulated.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn521-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn521">11</a></sup>
We also pointed out that the grammatical structure springs up along with it.
That is to say, together with the notion ‘am’ there arises a ‘here’. ‘Here’ am
I, he is ‘there’ and you are ‘yon’ or in front of me. This is the basic ground
plan for the grammatical structure, known to grammar as the first person, the
second person and the third person.</p>
<p>A world comes to be measured out and a grammatical structure springs up. This,
in fact, is the origin of proliferation, or <em>papañca</em>. So it is the freedom from
that proliferation that is meant by the expression <em>nev’idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantarena</em>, “neither here nor there nor between the two”. The notion of
one’s being in the world, or the bifurcation as ‘I’ and ‘the world’, is no
longer there. <em>Es’ev’anto dukkhassa</em>, this, then, is the end of suffering,
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The fundamental first principles underlying this short exhortation of the Buddha
could thus be inferred to some extent. We could perhaps elicit something more
regarding the significance of the four key terms in question.</p>
<p>In the section of the fours in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> we come across four modes
of noble usages, <em>cattāro ariya vohārā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn522-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn522">12</a></sup> namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhavāditā</em></li>
<li><em>sute sutavāditā</em></li>
<li><em>mute mutavāditā</em></li>
<li><em>viññāte viññātavāditā</em></li>
</ol>
<p>These four are:</p>
<ol>
<li>asserting the fact of having seen in regard to the seen,</li>
<li>asserting the fact of having heard in regard to the heard,</li>
<li>asserting the fact of having sensed in regard to the sensed,</li>
<li>asserting the fact of having cognized in regard to the cognized.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, these four noble usages stand for the principle of
truthfulness. In some discourses, as well as in the <em>Vinayapiṭaka</em>, these terms
are used in that sense. They are the criteria of the veracity of a statement in
general, not so much in a deep sense.</p>
<p>However, there are different levels of truth. In fact, truthfulness is a
question of giving evidence that runs parallel with one’s level of experience.
At higher levels of experience or realization, the evidence one gives also
changes accordingly.</p>
<p>The episode of Venerable Mahā Tissa Thera is a case in view.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn523-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn523">13</a></sup> When he met
a certain woman on his way, who displayed her teeth in a wily giggle, he simply
grasped the sign of her teeth. He did not totally refrain from grasping a sign,
but took it as an illustration of his meditation subject. Later, when that
woman’s husband, searching for her, came up to him and asked whether he had seen
a woman, he replied that all he saw was a skeleton. Now that is a certain level
of experience.</p>
<p>Similarly the concept of truthfulness is something that changes with levels of
experience. There are various degrees of truth, based on realization. The
highest among them is called <em>paramasacca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn524-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn524">14</a></sup> As to what that is, the
<em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> itself provides the answer in the following statement of
the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Etañhi, bhikkhu, paramaṁ ariyasaccaṁ yadidaṁ amosadhammaṁ Nibbānaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn525-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn525">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Monk, this is the highest noble truth, namely Nibbāna, that is of a
non-falsifying nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All other truths are falsified when the corresponding level of experience is
transcended. But Nibbāna is the highest truth, since it can never be falsified
by anything beyond it.</p>
<p>The fact that it is possible to give evidence by this highest level of
experience comes to light in the <em>Chabbisodhanasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.
In this discourse we find the Buddha instructing the monks as to how they should
interrogate a fellow monk who claims to have attained <em>arahanthood</em>. The
interrogation has to follow certain criteria, one of which concerns the four
standpoints <em>diṭṭha, suta, muta</em> and <em>viññāta</em>, the seen, the heard, the sensed
and the cognized.</p>
<p>What sort of answer a monk who rightly claims to <em>arahanthood</em> would give is
also stated there by the Buddha. It runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhe kho ahaṁ, āvuso, anupāyo anapāyo anissito appaṭibaddho vippamutto
visaṁyutto vimariyādikatena cetasā viharāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn526-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn526">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, is the highest mode of giving evidence in the court of Reality as an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends, with regard to the seen, I dwell unattracted, unrepelled,
independent, uninvolved, released, unshackled, with a mind free from barriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is unattracted, <em>anupāyo</em>, by lust and unrepelled, <em>anapāyo</em>, by hate. He is
not dependent, <em>anissito</em>, on cravings, conceits and views. He is not involved,
<em>appaṭibaddho</em>, with desires and attachments and is released, <em>vippamutto</em>, from
defilements. He is no longer shackled, <em>visaṁyutto</em>, by fetters and his mind is
free from barriers.</p>
<p>What these barriers are, we can easily infer. They are the bifurcations such as
the internal and the external, <em>ajjhatta bahiddhā</em>, which are so basic to what
is called existence, <em>bhava</em>. Where there are barriers, there are also
attachments, aversions and conflicts. Where there is a fence, there is defence
and offence.</p>
<p>So the <em>arahant</em> dwells with a mind unpartitioned and barrierless,
<em>vimariyādikatena cetasā</em>. To be able to make such a statement is the highest
standard of giving evidence in regard to the four noble usages.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> the Buddha has presented the
triple training of higher morality, higher concentration and higher wisdom,
<em>adhisīla, adhicitta</em> and <em>adhipaññā</em>, through these four noble usages. The
commentary, too, accepts this fact.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn527-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn527">17</a></sup> But this is a point that might need
clarification. How are we to distinguish between morality, concentration and
wisdom in this brief exhortation?</p>
<p>Now how does the exhortation begin? It opens with the words <em>tasmātiha te,
Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ</em>, “well then, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus.”
This is an indication that the Buddha introduced him to a course of training,
and this is the preliminary training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ
bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati.</em></p>
<p>In the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
be just the cognized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is hinted at by this initial instruction is the training in higher
morality, <em>adhisīlasikkhā</em>. The most important aspect of this training is the
morality of sense-restraint, <em>indriya saṁvara sīla</em>. The first principles of
sense-restraint are already implicit in this brief instruction.</p>
<p>If one stops short at just the seen in regard to the seen, one does not grasp a
sign in it, or dwell on its details. There is no sorting out as ‘this is good’,
‘this is bad’. That itself conduces to sense-restraint.</p>
<p>So we may conclude that the relevance of this brief instruction to the morality
of sense-restraint is in its enjoining the abstention from grasping a sign or
dwelling on the details. That is what pertains to the training in higher
morality, <em>adhisīlasikkha</em>.</p>
<p>Let us see how it also serves the purpose of training in higher concentration.
To stop at just the seen in the seen is to refrain from discursive thought,
which is the way to abandon mental hindrances. It is discursive thought that
brings hindrances in its train. So here we have what is relevant to the training
in higher concentration as well.</p>
<p>Then what about higher wisdom, <em>adhipaññā</em>? Something more specific has to be
said in this concern. What precisely is to be understood by higher wisdom in
this context? It is actually the freedom from imaginings, <em>maññanā</em>, and
proliferation, <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>If one stops short at just the seen in the seen, such ramifications as mentioned
in discourses like the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> do not come in at all. The tendency
to objectify the seen and to proliferate it as ‘in it’, ‘from it’ and ‘it is
mine’ receives no sanction. This course of training is helpful for the
emancipation of the mind from imaginings and proliferations.</p>
<p>The Buddha has compared the six sense-bases, that is eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body and mind, to a deserted village.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suññaṁ idaṁ attena vā attaniyena vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn528-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn528">18</a></sup></p>
<p>This is void of a self or anything belonging to a self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these sense-bases are devoid of a self or anything belonging to a self.
Therefore they are comparable to a deserted village, a village from which all
inhabitants have fled.</p>
<p>The dictum “in the seen there will be just the seen” is an advice conducive to
the attitude of regarding the six sense-bases as a deserted village. This is
what pertains to higher wisdom in the Buddha’s exhortation.</p>
<p><em>Papañca</em>, or prolific conceptualisation, is a process of transaction with
whatever is seen, heard, sensed, etc. So here there is no process of such
transaction. Also, when one trains oneself according to the instruction “in the
seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the heard, in
the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will be just the
cognized”, that identification implied by the term <em>tammayatā</em> will no longer be
there.</p>
<p>Egotism, the conceit ‘am’ and all what prompts conceptual proliferation will
come to an end. This kind of training uproots the peg of the conceit ‘am’,
thereby bringing about the cessation of prolific conceptualisation, the
cessation of becoming and the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>We can therefore conclude that the entire triple training is enshrined in this
exhortation. What happens as a result of this training is indicated by the
riddle like terms <em>na tena, na tattha, nev’idha na huraṁ na ubhayamantarena</em>.</p>
<p>When the wisdom of the ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya had sufficiently matured by
following the triple course of training, the Buddha gave the hint necessary for
realization of that cessation of becoming, which is Nibbāna, in the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, Bāhiya, you will not be by it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not by it,
then, Bāhiya, you are not in it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not in it, then,
Bāhiya, you are neither here nor there nor in between. This, itself, is the
end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sermon, therefore, is one that succinctly presents the quintessence of the
<em>Saddhamma</em>. It is said that the mind of the ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya was
released from all influxes immediately on hearing this exhortation.</p>
<p>Now let us come back to the sequence of events in the story as mentioned in the
<em>Udāna</em>. It was after the Buddha had already set out on his alms round that this
sermon was almost wrenched from him with much insistence. When it had proved its
worth, the Buddha continued with his alms round. Just then a cow with a young
calf gored the <em>arahant</em> Bāhiya Dārucīriya to death.</p>
<p>While returning from his alms round with a group of monks, the Buddha saw the
corpse of the <em>arahant</em> Bāhiya. He asked those monks to take the dead body on a
bed and cremate it. He even told them to build a cairn enshrining his relics,
saying: “Monks, a co-celibate of yours has passed away.”</p>
<p>Those monks, having carried out the instructions, came back and reported to the
Buddha. Then they raised the question: “Where has he gone after death, what is
his after death state?” The Buddha replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, Bāhiya Dārucīriya was wise, he lived up to the norm of the Dhamma, he
did not harass me with questions on Dhamma. Monks, Bāhiya Dārucīriya has
attained <em>Parinibbāna</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, the Buddha uttered the following verse of uplift:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>na tattha sukkā jotanti,</em> <br />
<em>ādicco nappakāsati,</em> <br />
<em>na tattha candimā bhāti,</em> <br />
<em>tamo tattha na vijjati.</em></p>
<p><em>Yadā ca attanāvedi,</em> <br />
<em>muni monena brāhmaṇo,</em> <br />
<em>atha rūpā arūpā ca,</em> <br />
<em>sukhadukkhā pamuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn529-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn529">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, the verse seems to imply something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where water, earth, fire and air <br />
Do not find a footing, <br />
There the stars do not shine, <br />
And the sun spreads not its lustre, <br />
The moon does not appear resplendent there, <br />
And no darkness is to be found there.</p>
<p>When the sage, the brahmin with wisdom, <br />
Understands by himself, <br />
Then is he freed from form and formless, <br />
And from pleasure and pain as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary to the <em>Udāna</em>, <em>Paramatthadīpanī</em>, gives a strange
interpretation to this verse. It interprets the verse as a description of the
destination of the <em>arahant</em> Bāhiya Dārucīriya after he attained <em>Parinibbāna</em>,
the place he went to.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn530-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn530">20</a></sup> Even the term <em>Nibbānagati</em> is used in that
connection, the ‘place’ one goes to in attaining <em>Parinibbāna</em>. That place,
according to the commentary, is not easily understood by worldlings. Its
characteristics are said to be the following:</p>
<p>The four elements, earth, water, fire and air, are not there. No sun, or moon,
or stars are there. The reason why the four elements are negated is supposed to
be the fact that there is nothing that is compounded in the uncompounded Nibbāna
element, into which the <em>arahant</em> passes away.</p>
<p>Since no sun, or moon, or stars are there in that mysterious place, one might
wonder why there is no darkness either. The commentator tries to forestall the
objection by stating that it is precisely because one might think that there
should be darkness when those luminaries are not there, that the Buddha
emphatically negates it. So the commentarial interpretation apparently leads us
to the conclusion that there is no darkness in the Nibbāna element, even though
no sun or moon or stars are there.</p>
<p>The line of interpretation we have followed throughout this series of sermons
allows us to depart from this commentarial trend. That place where earth, water,
fire and air do not find a footing is not where the <em>arahant</em> Bāhiya Dārucīriya
had ‘gone’ when he passed away. The commentator seems to have construed this
verse as a reply the Buddha gave to the question raised by those monks. Their
question was: “Where has he gone after death, what is his after death state?”
They were curious about his borne.</p>
<p>But when we carefully examine the context, it becomes clear that they raised
that question because they did not know that the corpse they cremated was that
of an <em>arahant</em>. Had they known it, they would not have even asked that
question. That is precisely the reason for the Buddha’s declaration that Bāhiya
attained <em>Parinibbāna</em>, a fact he had not disclosed before. He added that Bāhiya
followed the path of Dhamma without harassing him with questions and attained
<em>Parinibbāna</em>.</p>
<p>Now that is the answer proper. To reveal the fact that Bāhiya attained
<em>Parinibbāna</em> is to answer the question put by those inquisitive monks.
Obviously they knew enough of the Dhamma to understand then, that their question
about the borne and destiny of Venerable Bāhiya was totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>So then the verse uttered by the Buddha in conclusion was something extra. It
was only a joyous utterance, a verse of uplift, coming as a grand finale to the
whole episode.</p>
<p>Such verses of uplift are often to be met with in the <em>Udāna</em>. As we already
mentioned, the verses in the <em>Udāna</em> have to be interpreted very carefully,
because they go far beyond the implications of the story concerned.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn531-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn531">21</a></sup> They
invite us to take a plunge into the ocean of Dhamma. Just one verse is enough.
The text is small but deep. The verse in question is such a spontaneous
utterance of joy. It is not the answer to the question, “Where did he go?”</p>
<p>Well, in that case, what are we to understand by the word <em>yattha</em>, ‘where’?</p>
<p>We have already given a clue to it in our seventh sermon with reference to that
non-manifestative consciousness, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>. What the Buddha describes
in this verse, is not the place where the Venerable <em>arahant</em> Bāhiya went after
his demise, but the non-manifestative consciousness he had realized here and
now, in his concentration of the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>, or
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>Let us hark back to the four lines quoted in the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn532-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn532">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Consciousness which is non-manifestative, <br />
Endless, lustrous on all sides, <br />
It is here that water, earth, <br />
Fire and air no footing find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two lines of the verse in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>, beginning with the
correlative <em>yattha</em>, ‘where’, find an answer in the last two lines quoted above
from the <em>Kevaḍḍhasutta</em>.</p>
<p>What is referred to as ‘it is here’, is obviously the non-manifestative
consciousness mentioned in the first two lines. That problematic place indicated
by the word <em>yattha</em>, ‘where’, in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>, is none other than this
non-manifestative consciousness.</p>
<p>We had occasion to explain at length in what sense earth, water, fire and air
find no footing in that consciousness. The ghostly elements do not haunt that
consciousness. That much is clear.</p>
<p>But how are we to understand the enigmatic reference to the sun, the moon and
the stars? It is said that the stars do not shine in that non-manifestative
consciousness, the sun does not spread its lustre and the moon does not appear
resplendent in it, nor is there any darkness. How are we to construe all this?</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the Buddha’s declaration amounts to the revelation that the sun,
the moon and the stars fade away before the superior radiance of the
non-manifestative consciousness, which is infinite and lustrous on all sides.</p>
<p>How a lesser radiance fades away before a superior one, we have already
explained with reference to the cinema in a number of earlier sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn533-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn533">23</a></sup>
To sum up, the attention of the audience in a cinema is directed to the narrow
beam of light falling on the screen. The audience, or the spectators, are seeing
the scenes making up the film show with the help of that beam of light and the
thick darkness around.</p>
<p>This second factor is also very important. Scenes appear not simply because of
the beam of light. The thickness of the darkness around is also instrumental in
it. This fact is revealed when the cinema hall is fully lit up. If the cinema
hall is suddenly illuminated, either by the opening of doors and windows or by
some electrical device, the scenes falling on the screen fade away as if they
were erased. The beam of light, which was earlier there, becomes dim before the
superior light. The lesser lustre is superseded by a greater lustre.</p>
<p>We might sometimes be found fault with for harping on this cinema simile, on the
ground that it impinges on the precept concerning abstinence from enjoying
dramatic performances, song and music. But let us consider whether this cinema
is something confined to a cinema hall.</p>
<p>In the open air theatre of the world before us, a similar phenomenon of
supersedence is occurring. In the twilight glow of the evening the twinkling
stars enable us to faintly figure out the objects around us, despite the growing
darkness. Then the moon comes up. Now what happens to the twinkling little
stars? They fade away, their lustre being superseded by that of the moon.</p>
<p>Then we begin to enjoy the charming scenes before us in the serene moonlit
night. The night passes off. The day light gleam of the sun comes up. What
happens then? The soft radiance of the moon wanes before the majestic lustre of
the sun. The moon gets superseded and fades away. Full of confidence we are now
watching the multitude of technicoloured scenes in this massive theatre of the
world. In broad daylight, when sunshine is there, we have no doubt about our
vision of objects around us.</p>
<p>But now let us suppose that the extraneous defilements in the mind of a noble
disciple, treading the noble eightfold path, get dispelled, allowing its
intrinsic lustre of wisdom to shine forth. What happens then? The stars, the
moon and the sun get superseded by that light of wisdom. Even the forms that one
had seen by twilight, moonlight and sunlight fade away and pale into
insignificance. The umbra of form and the penumbra of the formless get fully
erased.</p>
<p>In the previous sermon we happened to mention that form and space are related to
each other, like the picture and its background. Now all this is happening in
the firmament, which forms the background. We could enjoy the scenes of the
world cinema, because of that darkness. The twilight, the moonlight and the
sunlight are but various levels of that darkness.</p>
<p>The worldling thinks that one who has eyes must surely see if there is sunshine.
He cannot think of anything beyond it. But the Buddha has declared that there is
something more radiant than the radiance of the sun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Natthi paññāsamā ābhā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn534-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn534">24</a></sup></p>
<p>there is no radiance comparable to wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us hark back to a declaration by the Buddha we had already quoted in a
previous sermon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Catasso imā, bhikkhave, pabhā. Katamā catasso? Candappabhā, sūriyappabhā,
aggippabhā, paññappabhā, imā kho, bhikkhave, catasso pabhā. Etadaggaṁ,
bhikkhave, imāsaṁ catunnaṁ pabhānaṁ, yad idaṁ paññappabhā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn535-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn535">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these four lustres. What four? The lustre of the moon, the
lustre of the sun, the lustre of fire, the lustre of wisdom. These, monks, are
the four lustres. This, monks, is the highest among these four lustres, namely
the lustre of wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, we can now understand why the form and the formless fade away. This
wisdom has a penetrative quality, for which reason it is called <em>nibbedhikā
paññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn536-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn536">26</a></sup></p>
<p>When one sees forms, one sees them together with their shadows. The fact that
one sees shadows there, is itself proof that darkness has not been fully
dispelled. If light comes from all directions, there is no shadow at all. If
that light is of a penetrative nature, not even form will be manifest there.</p>
<p>Now it is mainly due to what is called ‘form’ and ‘formless’, <em>rūpa/arūpa</em>, that
the worldling experiences pleasure and pain in a world that distinguishes
between a ‘pleasure’ and a ‘pain’.</p>
<p>Though we have departed from the commentarial path of exegesis, we are now in a
position to interpret the cryptic verse in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> perhaps more
meaningfully. Let us now recall the verse in question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>na tattha sukkā jotanti,</em> <br />
<em>ādicco nappakāsati,</em> <br />
<em>na tattha candimā bhāti,</em> <br />
<em>tamo tattha na vijjati.</em></p>
<p><em>Yadā ca attanāvedi,</em> <br />
<em>muni monena brāhmaṇo,</em> <br />
<em>atha rūpā arūpā ca,</em> <br />
<em>sukhadukkhā pamuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn537-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn537">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse can be fully explained along the lines of interpretation we have
adopted. By way of further proof of the inadequacy of the commentarial
explanation of the references to the sun, the moon and the stars in this verse,
we may draw attention to the following points.</p>
<p>According to the commentary the verse is supposed to express that there are no
sun, moon or stars in that mysterious place called <em>anupādisesa Nibbānadhātu</em>,
which is incomprehensible to worldlings.</p>
<p>We may, however, point out that the verbs used in the verse in this connection
do not convey the sense that the sun, the moon and the stars are simply non
existent there. They have something more to say.</p>
<p>For instance, with regard to the stars it is said that there the stars do not
shine, <em>na tattha sukkā jotanti</em>. If in truth and fact stars are not there, some
other verb like <em>na dissanti</em>, ‘are not seen’, or <em>na vijjanti</em>, ‘do not exist’,
could have been used.</p>
<p>With reference to the sun and the moon, also, similar verbs could have been
employed. But what we actually find here, are verbs expressive of spreading
light, shining, or appearing beautiful:</p>
<p><em>Na tattha sukkā jotanti,</em> “there the stars do not shine”;</p>
<p><em>ādicco nappakāsati,</em> “the sun spreads not its lustre”;</p>
<p><em>na tattha candimā bhāti,</em> “the moon does not appear resplendent there”.</p>
<p>These are not mere prosaic statements. The verse in question is a joyous
utterance, <em>Udānagāthā</em>, of extraordinary depth. There is nothing recondite
about it.</p>
<p>In our earlier assessment of the commentarial interpretation we happened to lay
special stress on the words ‘even though’. We are now going to explain the
significance of that emphasis. For the commentary, the line <em>tamo tattha na
vijjati,</em> “no darkness is to be found there”, is a big riddle. The sun, the moon
and the stars are not there. Even though they are not there, presumably, no
darkness is to be found there.</p>
<p>However, when we consider the law of superseding, we have already mentioned, we
are compelled to give a totally different interpretation. The sun, the moon and
the stars are not manifest, precisely because of the light of that
non-manifestative consciousness. As it is lustrous on all sides, <em>sabbato
pabha</em>, there is no darkness there and luminaries like the stars, the sun and
the moon do not shine there.</p>
<p>This verse of uplift thus reveals a wealth of information relevant to our topic.
Not only the exhortation to Bāhiya, but this verse also throws a flood of light
on the subject of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>That extraordinary place, which the commentary often identifies with the term
<em>anupādisesa Nibbānadhātu</em>, is this mind of ours. It is in order to indicate the
luminosity of this mind that the Buddha used those peculiar expressions in this
verse of uplift.</p>
<p>What actually happens in the attainment to the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>? The
worldling discerns the world around him with the help of six narrow beams of
light, namely the six sense-bases. When the superior lustre of wisdom arises,
those six sense-bases go down. This cessation of the six sense-bases could also
be referred to as the cessation of name-and-form, <em>nāmarūpanirodha</em>, or the
cessation of consciousness, <em>viññāṇanirodha</em>.</p>
<p>The cessation of the six sense-bases does not mean that one does not see
anything. What one sees then is voidness. It is an in-‘sight’. He gives
expression to it with the words <em>suñño loko</em>, ‘void is the world’.</p>
<p>What it means is that all the sense-objects, which the worldling grasps as real
and truly existing, get penetrated through with wisdom and become non-manifest.</p>
<p>If we are to add something more to this interpretation of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> by
way of review, we may say that this discourse illustrates the six qualities of
the Dhamma, namely <em>svākkhāto</em>, well proclaimed, <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em>, visible here and
now, <em>akāliko</em>, timeless, <em>ehipassiko</em>, inviting to come and see, <em>opanayiko</em>,
leading onward and <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi</em>, to be realized by the wise
each one by himself. These six qualities are wonderfully exemplified by this
discourse.</p>
<p>In a previous sermon we had occasion to bring up a simile of a dewdrop, dazzling
in the morning sunshine.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn538-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn538">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The task of seeing the spectrum of rainbow colours through a tiny dewdrop
hanging from a creeper or a leaf is one that calls for a high degree of
mindfulness. Simply by standing or sitting with one’s face towards the rising
sun, one will not be able to catch a glimpse of the brilliant spectrum of
rainbow colours through the dewdrop. It requires a particular viewpoint. Only
when one focuses on that viewpoint, can one see it.</p>
<p>So it is with the spectrum of the six qualities of the Dhamma. Here, too, the
correct viewpoint is a must, and that is right view. Reflection on the meaning
of deep discourses helps one to straighten up right view.</p>
<p>Where right view is lacking, morality inclines towards dogmatic attachment to
rituals, <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>. Concentration turns out to be wrong concentration,
<em>micchā samādhi</em>.</p>
<p>Like the one who sits facing the sun, one might be looking in the direction of
the Dhamma, but right view is not something one inherits by merely going to
refuge to the Buddha. It has to be developed with effort and proper attention.
View is something that has to be straightened up. For <em>diṭṭhujukamma</em>, the act
of straightening up one’s view is reckoned as one of the ten skilful deeds,
<em>kusalakamma</em>.</p>
<p>So however long one may sit with folded legs, gazing at the Buddha sun, one
might not be able to see the six rainbow colours of the Dhamma. One may be short
of just one-hundredth of an inch as the proper adjustment for right view. Yet it
is a must. Once that adjustment is made, one immediately, then and there,
<em>tavad’eva</em>, catches a glimpse of the spectrum of the Dhamma that the Buddha has
proclaimed.</p>
<p>We have stressed the importance of right view in particular, because many are
grappling with a self created problem, concerning the proper alignment between
the triple training and the right view of the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>Now as to the triple training, morality, concentration and wisdom, we find
wisdom mentioned last. It seems, then, that we have to perfect morality first,
then develop concentration, and only lastly wisdom. One need not think of wisdom
before that.</p>
<p>But when we come to the noble eightfold path, we find a different order of
values. Here right view takes precedence. As a matter of fact, in the
<em>Mahācattārīsakasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> we find the Buddha repeatedly
declaring emphatically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tatra, bhikkhave, sammā diṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā</em>,</p>
<p>monks, therein right view takes precedence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn539-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn539">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in a context where the subject is morality, we find a similar statement. So
how are we to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>In the noble eightfold path, pride of place is given to right view, which is
representative of the wisdom group. As the well-known definition goes, right
view and right thoughts belong to the wisdom group; right speech, right action
and right livelihood come under the morality group; and right effort, right
mindfulness and right concentration belong to the concentration group.</p>
<p>So in this way, in the noble eightfold path, wisdom comes first, then morality
and lastly concentration.</p>
<p>But in the context of these three groups, firstly comes morality, secondly
concentration and lastly wisdom. Here, too, the answer given by the
<em>arahant-nun</em> Venerable Dhammadinnā to the lay disciple Visākha comes to our
aid.</p>
<p>The lay disciple Visākha poses the following question to Venerable Dhammadinnā:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ariyena nu kho ayye aṭṭhaṅgikena maggena tayo khandhā saṅgahitā, udāhu tīhi
khandhehi ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo saṅgahito?</em></p>
<p>Good lady, are the three groups morality, concentration and wisdom, included
by the noble eightfold path, or is the noble eightfold path included by the
three groups?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn540-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn540">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even at that time there may have been some who raised such questions. That is
probably the reason for such a query. Then the <em>arahant-nun</em> Dhammadinnā
answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na kho āvuso Visākha ariyena aṭṭhaṅgikena maggena tayo khandhā saṅgahitā,
tīhi ca kho āvuso Visākha khandhehi ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo saṅgahito</em>.</p>
<p>Friend Visākha, it is not that the threefold training is included by the noble
eightfold path, but the noble eightfold path is included by the threefold
training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this appears to be something of a tangle, let us try to illustrate the
position with some other kind of tangle. Suppose someone is trying to climb up a
long rope, made up of three strands. As he climbs up, his fingertips might come
now in contact with the first strand, now with the second and now with the
third. He is not worried about the order of the three strands, so long as they
are well knit. One can safely climb up, holding onto the three strands, only
when they are firmly wound up into a sturdy rope.</p>
<p>All these questions seem to have arisen due to an attitude of taking too
seriously the numerical order of things. To the noble disciple climbing up the
rope of the noble eightfold path, there need not be any confusion between the
numerical order of the triple training and that of the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>But if someone taking the cue from the order of the triple training neglects
right view or ignores its prime import, he might end up confused.</p>
<p>All in all, we are now in a position to correctly assess the deep significance
of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>. Here we have the quintessence of the entire <em>Saddhamma</em>.
We are not confronted with heaps of perceptual data, which we are told today are
essential requisites for admission into the ‘city’ of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>For the ordinary worldling, amassing a particular set of percepts or concepts
seems a qualification for entering Nibbāna. But what we have here, is a way of
liberating the mind even from latencies to percepts. See <em>saññā nānusenti</em>,
<em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>, “perceptions do not lie latent.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn541-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn541">31</a></sup> There is no
heaping up anew.</p>
<p>What are called ‘extraneous taints’, <em>āgantukā upakkilesā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn542-1"><a href="sermon-15.html#fn-fn542">32</a></sup> are not
confined to the well known defilements in the world. They include all the rust
and dust we have been collecting throughout this long <em>saṁsāra</em>, with the help
of the influxes, <em>āsavā</em>. They include even the heap of percepts which the world
calls ‘knowledge’. Even numerals are part of it.</p>
<p>The Buddha has briefly expressed here the mode of practice for disabusing the
mind from all such taints. Therefore there is no reason for underestimating the
value of this discourse, by calling it <em>vohāra desanā</em>, conventional teaching.
This discourse in the <em>Udāna</em> is one that is truly ‘up’-lifting.</p>
<p>It indeed deserves a paean of joy.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the sixteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the course of our discussion of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> in our last sermon, we drew
attention to the wide gap that exists between the sensory experience of the
worldling and that experience the <em>arahant</em> gets through the eye of wisdom.</p>
<p>It is the same gap that obtains between the two terms <em>papañca</em> and
<em>nippapañca</em>. In sensory experience, which is based on worldly expressions,
worldly usages and worldly concepts, there is a discrimination between a thing
to be grasped and the one who grasps, or, in other words, a subject-object
relationship.</p>
<p>There is always a bifurcation, a dichotomy, in the case of sensory perception.
If there is a seen, there has to be something seen and the one who sees. That is
the logic. In the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>, beginning with “in the seen there will be just
the seen”, the Buddha proclaimed to the ascetic Bāhiya a brief exhortation on
Dhamma which enables one to transcend the above narrow view point and attain the
state of non-proliferation or <em>nippapañca</em>.</p>
<p>There is nothing to see, no one to see, only ‘a seen’ is there. The cause of all
these conceptual proliferation, or <em>papañca</em>, in the world is contact. The
<em>arahants</em> understood this by their insight into the fact that the seen, the
heard, the sensed and the cognized are simply so many collocations of conditions
which come together for a moment due to contact, only to break up and get
dispersed the next moment.</p>
<p>What is called the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized are for the
worldling so many ‘things’. But to the wisdom eye of the <em>arahants</em> they appear
as mere conglomerations of conditions, dependent on contact, which momentarily
come together and then get dispersed. This insight into the dependence on
contact, <em>phassam paṭicca</em>, is the very essence of the law of dependent arising,
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. It is equivalent to seeing the law of dependent arising
itself.</p>
<p>In order to transcend the narrow point of view limited to the bases of sense
contact or the six sense spheres and realize the state of Nibbāna indicated by
the words <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn544-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn544">2</a></sup> “consciousness
which is non-manifestative, endless, lustrous on all sides”, one has to see the
cessation of contact.</p>
<p>In a certain discourse in the <em>Mucalindavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>, the Buddha has
declared in a verse of uplift that the cessation of contact comes about only by
doing away with that which brings about contact. The wandering ascetics of other
sects grew jealous of the Buddha and his congregation of monks, because of their
own loss of gain and honour, and began to hurl abuse on monks in the village and
in the forest.</p>
<p>A group of monks came and reported this to the Buddha. The Buddha’s response to
it was only a paean of joy. <em>Udāna</em> actually means a spontaneous utterance of
joy, and the verse he uttered was such a one. But it embodied an instruction on
Dhamma and a norm of Dhamma as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gāme araññe sukhadukkhaphuṭṭho,</em> <br />
<em>nev’attato no parato dahetha,</em> <br />
<em>phusanti phassā upadhiṁ paṭicca,</em> <br />
<em>Nirūpadhiṁ kena phuseyyum phassā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn545-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn545">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first two lines we get an instruction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touched by pain in village or in forest, <br />
Think not in terms of oneself or others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for it is given in the norm of Dhamma which follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touches can touch one, because of assets, <br />
How can touches touch him, who is asset-less?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all what the Buddha uttered. From this we can glean another aspect of
the significance of the terms <em>sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga</em>, relinquishment of all
assets, and <em>nirupadhi</em>, the asset-less, used with reference to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In a number of previous sermons we happened to explain the concept of <em>upadhi</em>
to some extent, as and when the terms <em>upadhi</em> and <em>paṭinissagga</em> came
up.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn546-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn546">4</a></sup> To refresh our memory, we may summarize all that now. What is the
concept of <em>upadhi</em>, or ‘assets’, recognized by the world?</p>
<p>Whatever that bolsters up the ego, be it gold, silver, pearls, gems, money,
house and property, deposits and assets. All these are reckoned as <em>upadhi</em> in
general. But when considered from the point of view of Dhamma, <em>upadhi</em> in a
deeper sense stands for this fivefold grasping groups, <em>pañcupādānakkhandha</em>.</p>
<p><em>Upādānakkhandha</em> literally means ‘groups of grasping’. Groups of grasping do
not necessarily imply that there are material objects to be grasped. But the
worldling, overcome by that triple proliferation of cravings, conceits and
views, and carried away by the worldly conventions, imagines those groups of
grasping as things grasped and deposited.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>upadhi</em> as assets has arisen as a result of this tendency to
think of groups of grasping as things grasped and deposited. So it turns out to
be a question of viewpoint.</p>
<p>Cravings, conceits and views prompt one to look upon all what one has grasped so
far and what one hopes to grasp in the future as things one is grasping right
now. One thinks of them as things deposited in a safe. The worldlings are
holding on to such a mass of assets.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is the relinquishment of all such assets, accumulated in the mind. In
order to relinquish these assets there must be some kind of understanding – an
enlightenment. The vanity of all these assets has to be seen through by the
light of wisdom. It is only by seeing their vanity that the assets are
relinquished. In fact it is not so much a deliberate giving up of assets, as a
sequential liquidation.</p>
<p>In a previous sermon we gave an illustration of the situation that precipitates
relinquishment. Let us bring it up again. We found the cinema quite helpful as
an illustration. In explaining the phenomenon of relinquishment of assets with
reference to the cinema, we described how the assets accumulated in the minds of
the audience, that is, the assets proper to the cinema world woven around the
story that is filmed, are automatically abandoned when the cinema hall gets lit
up.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn547-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn547">5</a></sup> Then one understands the illusory nature of what has been going on.
It is that understanding, that enlightenment, which precipitates the giving up
or relinquishment of assets.</p>
<p>To go a step further in this illustration, when lights came on the <em>saṅkhāras</em>
or preparations pertaining to the film show got exposed for what they are. In
fact, <em>saṅkhāra</em> is a word that has associations with the dramatic tradition in
its relation to the acting of actors and actresses down to their make-up, which
is so artificial and spurious.</p>
<p>When the cinema hall gets lit up all of a sudden, one who has been enjoying the
film show is momentarily thrown out of the cinema world, because those
preparations are pacified or nullified, <em>sabba saṅkhārasamatho</em>. As a
consequence of it, the heap of experiences which he had hitherto regarded as
real and genuine, lose their sanction. Those assets get liquidated or
relinquished, <em>sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga</em>.</p>
<p>In their absence, that craving necessary for the appreciation or enjoyment of
the scenes to come becomes extinct, <em>taṇhakkhayo</em>. When craving is gone, the
floridity of the scenes to come also fades away, <em>virāga</em>. With that fading away
or decolouration, the film show ceases for the person concerned, <em>nirodha</em>,
though technically the movie is going on. Because of that cessation all the
fires of defilements proper to the cinema world, with which he was burning, get
extinguished, Nibbāna.</p>
<p>So here we have the full gamut of the cinema simile as an illustration for
Nibbāna. This kind of awakening in the cinema world gives us a clue to the fact
that the assets, <em>upadhi</em>, are relinquished through an understanding born of
enlightenment in the light of wisdom. This in fact is something that should be
deeply ingrained in our minds. Therefore we shall endeavour to give some more
illustrations to that effect.</p>
<p>In our everyday life, too, we sometimes see and hear of instances where assets
get relinquished due to understanding. Someone heaps up a huge bundle of
currency notes of the highest denomination, deposits it in his safe and keeps
watch and ward over it day and night. One fine morning he wakes up to hear that
for some reason or other that currency note has been fully devalued by law the
previous night. How does he look upon the wads of notes in his safe now? For
him, it is now a mere heap of papers.</p>
<p>The craving, conceit and view he had earlier in regard to the notes are
completely gone. The bank notes are no longer valid. He might as well make a
bonfire of it. So this is some sort of relinquishment of assets in the world,
however temporary it may be.</p>
<p>Another person gets a sudden transfer and is getting ready to leave for his new
station. His immovable assets he is forced to leave behind, but his movable
assets he hurriedly gathers up to take with him. The vehicle has already come
and is tooting impatiently, signalling delay. It is well past time, but his
‘preparations’ are not finished. Time-pressed, in hot haste, he is running here
and there.</p>
<p>At last, when he can delay no longer, he grabs the utmost he can take
and darts to the doorstep. Just then, he wakes up. It was only a dream! The
transfer came in a dream. No real vehicle, no real preparation, only a panting
for nothing!</p>
<p>So here we have an ‘awakening’ peculiar to the dream world. This is an instance
of letting go of assets connected with a dream. We go through such experiences
quite often. Of course, we take it for granted that when we pass from the dream
world to the real world, the assets proper to the dream world drop off. But are
we sure that in leaving the dream world we are entering a real world? Is
awakening from a dream a true awakening when considered from the point of view
of the Dhamma? Do we actually open our eyes, when we awaken from a dream?</p>
<p>Terms like Buddha, <em>bodhi</em> and <em>sambodhi</em> convey the sense of awakening as well
as understanding. Sometimes in the Dhamma the emphasis is on the sense of
awakening. Here then is a kind of awakening.</p>
<p>Expressions like <em>dhammacakkhu</em>, ‘Dhamma-eye’, <em>paññācakkhu</em>, ‘Wisdom-eye’, and
<em>cakkhuṁ udapādi</em>, ‘the eye arose’, bespeak of an arising of some sort of an
eye. We already have eyes, but an eye is said to arise. All this goes to show
that in the context of Nibbāna, where we are concerned with the deeper aspects
of the Dhamma, the awakening from a dream is not a true awakening. It is only a
passage from one dream world to another.</p>
<p>But let us see how the concept of <em>upadhi</em>, or assets, goes deeper. What lies
before us is the dream of <em>saṁsāra</em>. In order to awaken from this dream, we have
to understand somehow the vanity of all assets connected with the dream that is
<em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>The fact that this understanding also comes through some illumination we have
already explained the other day in our discussion of the paean of joy at the end
of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn548-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn548">6</a></sup> As we pointed out then, the world of the six
sense-bases which the worldlings regard as ‘their world’, when examined against
the background of that <em>Udāna</em> verse reveals itself to be no more than six
narrow beams of light, appearing through a solidly thick curtain, namely the
darkness of delusion.</p>
<p>We happened to mention the other day that the sun, the moon and the stars shine
precisely because of the presence of darkness. In the non-manifestative
consciousness which is infinite and lustrous all round, <em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,
anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, sun, moon and stars are not manifest, because there is
absolutely no darkness for them to shine forth. Even the formless, which is the
penumbra of form, disappears in that penetrative lustre of wisdom.</p>
<p>So the relinquishment of all assets, Nibbāna, is not like the other temporary
awakenings already mentioned. Those three instances of awakening are of a
temporary nature. The awakening in the cinema world is extremely short lived.
That film fan, although he became disenchanted with the scenes because of the
unexpected sudden illumination of the cinema hall, when it is dark again,
influxes of sensuality, existence and ignorance so overwhelm him that he gets
engrossed in the cinema world as before.</p>
<p>The case of the devalued currency note is also like that. Though the cravings,
conceits and views about the devalued note are gone, one still runs after notes
that are valid. As for the awakening from a dream, we all know that it is
temporary. When again we go to sleep, we have dreams.</p>
<p>But the awakening in Nibbāna is not of such a temporary character. Why? Because
all the influxes that lead one into the <em>saṁsāric</em> slumber with its dreams of
recurrent births are made extinct in the light of that perfect knowledge of
realization. That is why the term <em>āsavakkhaya</em>, extinction of influxes, is used
in the discourses as an epithet of Nibbāna. The <em>arahants</em> accomplish this feat
in the concentration on the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>, <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>Though there are enough instances of references to this <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>
in the discourses, they are very often interpreted differently. As we have
already seen in the context of that verse of uplift in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>, some
discourses alluding to the nature of an <em>arahant’s</em> mind have been
misinterpreted, so much so that there is a lot of confusion in regard to the
concept of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, that concentration peculiar to an <em>arahant</em> is of an
extraordinary type. It baffles the worldling’s powers of understanding. This can
well be inferred from the following verse of the <em>Ratanasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ Buddhaseṭṭho parivaṇṇayī suciṁ,</em> <br />
<em>samādhim ānantarikaññam āhu,</em> <br />
<em>samādhinā tena samo na vijjati,</em> <br />
<em>idampi Dhamme ratanaṁ paṇītaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etena saccena suvatthi hotu</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn549-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn549">7</a></sup></p>
<p>That pure concentration, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> which the Supremely Awakened One extolled, <br />
That concentration which the Noble Ones call ‘immediate’, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> (<em>ānantarika</em>) <br />
There is no concentration comparable to it, <br />
This is the excellent jewel nature of the Dhamma, <br />
By the power of this truth may there be well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This incomparable and extraordinary concentration has given rise to many
problems concerning the concept of Nibbāna. The extraordinariness of this
concentration of the <em>arahant</em> is to some extent connected with the term
<em>ānantarika</em>, referred to above. Now let us turn our attention to the
significance of this term.</p>
<p>The verse says that the concentration of the <em>arahant</em> is also known as
<em>ānantarika</em>. The term <em>ānantarika</em> is suggestive of an extraordinary aspect of
the realization of Nibbāna. Immediately after the extinction of the defilements
through the knowledge of the path of <em>arahanthood</em> one realizes Nibbāna, the
cessation of existence or the cessation of the six sense-bases. As we mentioned
earlier, it is as if the results are out as soon as one has written for an
examination.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn550-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn550">8</a></sup> One need not wait for the results. Realization is
immediate.</p>
<p>There is a special term to denote this experience of realization, namely,
<em>aññā</em>. It is a highly significant term, derived from <em>ājānāti</em>, ‘to know
fully’. <em>Aññā</em> is ‘full comprehension’.</p>
<p>The concentration of the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em> is also called
<em>aññāphalasamādhi</em> and <em>aññāvimokkha</em>.</p>
<p><em>Aññā</em> carries with it a high degree of importance. We come across in the sutta
terminology a number of terms derived from the root <em>ñā</em>, ‘to know’, namely
<em>saññā, viññāṇa, paññā, ñāṇa, abhiññā, pariññā, aññā</em>.</p>
<p><em>Saññā</em> is ‘perception’, <br />
<em>viññāṇa</em> is, radically, ‘discriminative knowledge’, <br />
<em>paññā</em> is ‘distinctive knowledge’, <br />
<em>ñāṇa</em> is ‘knowledge’ as such, <br />
<em>abhiññā</em> is ‘specialized knowledge’, <br />
<em>pariññā</em> is ‘comprehensive knowledge’, <br />
<em>aññā</em> is that ‘final knowledge’ of certitude through realization.</p>
<p>The high degree of importance attached to <em>aññā</em> is revealed by the following two verses in the <em>Itivuttaka</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sekhassa sikkhamānassa</em> <br />
<em>ujumaggānusārino</em> <br />
<em>khayasmiṁ paṭhamaṁ ñāṇaṁ</em> <br />
<em>tato aññā anantarā</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tato aññā vimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>ñāṇaṁ ve hoti tādino</em> <br />
<em>akuppā me vimuttī’ti</em> <br />
<em>bhavasaṁyojanakkhaye.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn551-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn551">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the disciple in higher training, as he fares along <br />
Training according to the straight path, <br />
There arises first the knowledge of extinction, <br />
And then immediately the final knowledge of certitude.</p>
<p>And to that steadfast such-like-one, <br />
Thus released by final knowledge of certitude, <br />
There arises the thought: <br />
<span class="vin"></span> ‘Unshakeable is my deliverance’, <br />
Upon the destruction of fetters of existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident from these two verses that the realization referred to is in many
ways final and complete. In point of fact, these two verses have been presented
by the Buddha in this context by way of defining three things relevant to the
realization of Nibbāna. These three are called faculties, <em>indriya</em>. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>anaññātaññāssāmīt’indriya</em></li>
<li><em>aññindriya</em></li>
<li><em>aññātāvindriya</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The term <em>aññā</em> is implicit even in the faculty called
<em>anaññātaññāssāmīt’indriya</em>. <em>Anaññātaññāssāmi</em> means “I shall know what has not
been fully known”.</p>
<p>This is the definition of what in the verse is referred to as <em>khayasmiṁ
paṭhamaṁ ñāṇaṁ</em>, “first there is the knowledge of extinction”. The knowledge of
the extinction of the defilements is called <em>anaññātaññāssāmīt’indriya</em> in this
context.</p>
<p>The words <em>tato aññā anantarā</em>, “and then immediately the final knowledge of
certitude”, refer to that faculty of final knowledge, or <em>aññindriya</em>. The
knowledge that prompts the conviction “unshakeable is my deliverance” is the
knowledge and vision of deliverance, which is defined as <em>aññātāvindriya.</em> It
refers to one who is endowed with the final knowledge of certitude.</p>
<p>The difference between <em>aññindriya</em> and <em>aññātāvindriya</em> is a subtle one. For
instance, the expression <em>bhuttāvī pavārito</em>, one has finished eating and made a
sign of refusal, decisively shows that one has had one’s fill.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn552-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn552">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, it is that <em>aññātāvindriya</em> (note the past active participle), which
prompts the words “unshakeable is my deliverance”, <em>akuppā me vimutti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn553-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn553">11</a></sup>
The knowledge and vision of deliverance is reassuring to that extent.</p>
<p>As the above quoted verse from the <em>Ratanasutta</em> makes it clear, this unique and
extraordinary concentration has been extolled by the Buddha in various
discourses. But for some reason or other, the commentators have simply glossed
over references to it, though they sometimes expatiate on a particle of mere
grammatical interest. Let us now take up for comment a few such discourses.</p>
<p>In the section of the Elevens in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> there comes a discourse
called <em>Sandhasutta</em>. There the Buddha gives to Venerable Sandha a description
of a level of concentration characteristic of an excellent thoroughbred of a
man. It is a strange type of concentration. One who has that concentration is
described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So neva paṭhaviṁ nissāya jhāyati, na āpaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na tejaṁ nissāya
jhāyati, na vāyaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na
viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na idhalokaṁ nissāya jhāyati, na
paralokaṁ nissāya jhāyati, yam p’idaṁ diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ
pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā, tam pi nissāya na jhāyati, jhāyati ca pana.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ jhāyiṁ ca pana, Sandha, bhadraṁ purisājānīyaṁ sa-indā devā sabrahmakā
sapajapatikā ārakā’va namassanti:</em></p>
<p><em>Namo te purisājañña,</em> <br />
<em>namo te purisuttama,</em> <br />
<em>yassa te nābhijānāma,</em> <br />
<em>yampi nissāya jhāyasi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn554-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn554">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this discourse, the Buddha gives, as an illustration, the musing of a
thoroughbred of a horse, which we shall drop for brevity’s sake. The musing of
an excellent thoroughbred of a man is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He muses not dependent on earth, water, fire, air, the sphere of infinite
space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he muses not dependent on
this world or on the world beyond, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,
attained, sought after, traversed by the mind, dependent on all that he muses
not – and yet he does muse.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sandha, to him thus musing the <em>devas</em> with <em>Indra,</em> with Brahmā
and with Pajāpati even from afar bow down, saying:</p>
<p>“Homage to you, O thoroughbred of a man, <br />
Homage to you, O most excellent of men, <br />
For what it is on which you go on musing, <br />
We are at a loss to comprehend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though all possible objects of concentration are negated, the Buddha affirms
that he does muse. Venerable Sandha, out of curiosity inquires:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then how, Lord, does that thoroughbred of a man muse?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha explains that while in that state of concentration, the perception of
earth in earth, for instance, is gone for him, <em>pathaviyā pathavīsaññā vibhūtā
hoti</em>. So also in the case of other objects of the senses, such as water, fire,
air, down to whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after
and traversed by the mind.</p>
<p>The verb <em>vibhūtā</em>, repeatedly used in this connection, is however differently
interpreted in the commentary. It is paraphrased by <em>pākaṭā</em>, which means
‘clearly manifest’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn555-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn555">13</a></sup> This interpretation seems to distort the meaning of
the entire passage.</p>
<p>It is true that in certain contexts <em>vibhūta</em> and <em>avibhūta</em> are taken to mean
‘manifest’ and ‘unmanifest’, since <em>vibhava</em> is a word which seems to have
undergone some semantic development. However, its primary sense is sufficiently
evident in the sutta terminology.</p>
<p>For instance, the twin term <em>bhava/vibhava</em> stands for ‘existence’ and
‘non-existence’. In this context, too, <em>vibhūta</em> seems to have a negative sense,
rather than the sense of being manifest. Hence our rendering: “The perception of
earth is gone for him”.</p>
<p>It is obvious enough by the recurrent negative particle in the first part of the
sutta (<em>neva paṭhaviṁ nissāya jhāyati, na āpaṁ nissāya jhāyati</em>, etc.) that all
those perceptions are negated and not affirmed as manifest. The commentator
seems to have missed the true import of the sutta when he interprets <em>vibhūta</em>
to mean ‘manifest’.</p>
<p>If further proof is required, we may quote instances where the word <em>vibhūta</em> is
used in the suttas to convey such senses as ‘gone’, ‘departed’ or ‘transcended’.</p>
<p>In one of the verses we happened to quote earlier from the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>,
there was the question posed: <em>Kismiṁ vibhūte na phusanti phassā?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn556-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn556">14</a></sup> “When
what is not there, do touches not touch?”</p>
<p>The verse that follows gives the answer: <em>Rūpe vibhūte na phusanti
phassā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn557-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn557">15</a></sup> “When form is not there, touches do not touch.” In this
context, too, <em>vibhūta</em> implies absence.</p>
<p>A clearer instance comes in the <em>Posālamāṇavapucchā</em> of the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> in
the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, namely the term <em>vibhūtarūpasaññissa</em>, occurring in one of
the verses there.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn558-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn558">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The canonical commentary <em>Cūḷaniddesa</em>, which the commentator often draws upon,
also paraphrases the term with the words <em>vigatā, atikkantā, samatikkantā,
vītivattā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn559-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn559">17</a></sup> “gone, transcended, fully transcended, and superseded”.</p>
<p>So the word <em>vibhūta</em> in the passage in question definitely implies the absence
of all those perceptions in that concentration. This, then, is a unique
concentration. It has none of the objects which the worldlings usually associate
with a level of concentration.</p>
<p>We come across a number of instances in the discourses, in which the Buddha and
some other monks have been interrogated on the nature of this extraordinary
concentration. Sometimes even Venerable Ānanda is seen to confront the Buddha
with a question on this point.</p>
<p>In a discourse included in the section of the Elevens in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>,
Venerable Ānanda questions on the possibility of attaining to such a
concentration with an air of wonderment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Siyā nu kho, bhante, bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā neva
pathaviyaṁ pathavīsaññī assa, na āpasmiṁ āposaññī assa, na tejasmiṁ tejosaññī
assa, na vāyasmiṁ vāyosaññī assa, na ākāsānañcāyatane ākāsānañcāyatanasaññī
assa, na viññāṇañcāyatane viññāṇancāyatanasaññī assa, na ākiñcaññāyatane
ākiñcaññāyatanasaññī assa, na nevasaññānāsaññāyatane
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasaññī assa, na idhaloke idhalokasaññī assa, na paraloke
paralokasaññī assa, yam p’idaṁ diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ pariyesitaṁ
anuvicaritaṁ manasā tatrāpi na saññī assa, saññī ca pana assa?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn560-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn560">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Could there be, Lord, for a monk such an attainment of concentration wherein
he will not be conscious (literally ‘percipient’) of earth in earth, nor of
water in water, nor of fire in fire, nor of air in air, nor will he be
conscious of the sphere of infinite space in the sphere of infinite space, nor
of the sphere of infinite consciousness in the sphere of infinite
consciousness, nor of the sphere of nothingness in the sphere of nothingness,
nor of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, nor will he be conscious of a this
world in this world, nor of a world beyond in a world beyond, whatever is
seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, traversed by the mind,
even of it he will not be conscious – and yet he will be conscious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas the passage quoted earlier began with <em>so neva pathaviṁ nissāya
jhāyati</em>, “he muses not dependent on earth” and ended with the emphatic
assertion <em>jhāyati ca pana</em>, “and yet he does muse”, here we have a restatement
of it in terms of perception, beginning with <em>neva pathaviyaṁ pathavīsaññī</em> and
ending with <em>saññī ca pana assa</em>. The Buddha answers in the affirmative and on
being questioned as to how it is possible he gives the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idh’Ānanda, bhikkhu, evaṁ saññī hoti: Etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yadidaṁ
sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho
nibbānan’ti. Evaṁ kho, Ānanda, siyā bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho</em> …</p>
<p>Herein, Ānanda, a monk is thus conscious (<em>evaṁ saññī</em>): This is peaceful,
this is excellent, namely the stilling of all preparations, the relinquishment
of all assets, the destruction of craving, detachment, cessation, extinction.
It is thus, Ānanda, that there could be for a monk such an attainment of
concentration …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in fact, is the theme of all our sermons. Venerable Ānanda, of course,
rejoiced in the Buddha’s words, but approached Venerable Sāriputta also and put
forward the same question. Venerable Sāriputta gave the same answer verbatim.</p>
<p>Then Venerable Ānanda gave expression to a joyous approbation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchariyaṁ āvuso, abbhutaṁ āvuso, yatra hi nāma satthu ca sāvakassa ca
atthena atthaṁ vyañjanena vyañjanaṁ saṁsandissati samessati na viggahissati,
yad idaṁ aggapadasmiṁ.</em></p>
<p>Friend, it is wonderful, it is marvellous, that there is perfect conformity
between the statements of the teacher and the disciple to the letter and to
the spirit without any discord on the question of the highest level of
attainment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These last words, in particular, make it sufficiently clear that this
concentration is <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, the concentration proper to an
<em>arahant</em>. Here, then, is the experience of Nibbāna, extraordinary and unique.</p>
<p>Quite a number of discourses touch upon this <em>samādhi</em>. Let us take up some of
the more important references. Venerable Ānanda is seen to pose the same
question, rephrased, on yet another occasion. It runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Siyā nu kho, bhante, tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā na cakkhuṁ
manasikareyya, na rūpaṁ manasikareyya, na sotaṁ manasikareyya, na saddaṁ
manasikareyya, na ghānaṁ manasikareyya, na gandhaṁ manasikareyya, na jivhaṁ
manasikareyya, na rasaṁ manasikareyya, na kāyaṁ manasikareyya, na phoṭṭhabbaṁ

viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ manasikareyya, na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ manasikareyya, na
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ manasikareyya, na idhalokaṁ manasikareyya, na
paralokaṁ manasikareyya, yam p’idaṁ diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ
pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā tam pi na manasikareyya, manasi ca pana
kareyya?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn561-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn561">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Could there be, Lord, for a monk such an attainment of concentration wherein
he will not be attending to the eye, nor to form, nor to the ear, nor to
sound, nor to the nose, nor to smell, nor to the tongue, nor to taste, nor to
the body, nor to touch, nor to earth, nor to water, nor to fire, nor to air,
nor to the sphere of infinite space, nor to the sphere of infinite
consciousness, nor to the sphere of nothingness, nor to the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, nor to this world, nor to the world
beyond, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after,
traversed by the mind, even to that he will not be attending – and yet he will
be attending?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“There could be such a concentration”, says the Buddha, and Venerable Ānanda
rejoins with his inquisitive: “How, Lord, could there be?” Then the Buddha gives
the following explanation, which tallies with the one earlier given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idh’Ānanda, bhikkhu evaṁ manasi karoti: Etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yadidaṁ
sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho
nibbānan’ti. Evaṁ kho, Ānanda, siyā bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho</em> …</p>
<p>Herein, Ānanda , a monk attends thus: This is peaceful, this is excellent,
namely the stilling of all preparations, the relinquishment of all assets, the
destruction of craving, detachment, cessation, extinction. It is thus, Ānanda,
that there could be such an attainment of concentration …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are now in a position to take up
for comment that enigmatic verse of the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>, which in a previous
sermon we left unexplained, giving only a slight hint in the form of a
simile.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn562-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn562">20</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na saññasaññī na visaññasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>no pi asaññī na vibhūtasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn563-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn563">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general trend of this verse seems to imply something like this: The
worldlings usually believe that one has to have some form of perception or
other. But the one referred to in this verse is not percipient with any such
perception, <em>na saññasaññī</em>.</p>
<p>As if to forestall the question, whether he is then in a swoon, there is the
negation <em>na visaññasaññī</em>. A possible alternative, like a plane of existence
devoid of perception, is also avoided by the emphatic assertion <em>no pi asaññī</em>.
Yet another possibility, that he has gone beyond perception or rescinded it, is
rejected as well with the words <em>na vibhūtasaññī</em>.</p>
<p>The third line says that it is to one thus endowed that form ceases to exist,
while the last line seems to give an indication as to why it is so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā</em>,</p>
<p>for reckonings born of proliferation have perception as their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nature of these reckonings we have already discussed at length. The
conclusion here given is that they are rooted in <em>papañca</em>. Now the passages we
have so far quoted are suggestive of such a state of consciousness. Briefly
stated, even the emphatic tone characteristic of these discourses is sufficient
proof of it.</p>
<p>For instance, in the first discourse we took up for discussion, there is the
recurrent phrase <em>na jhāyati</em>, “does not muse”, with reference to all the
possible objects of the senses, but at the end of it all comes the emphatic
assertion <em>jhāyati ca pana</em>, “nevertheless, he does muse”.</p>
<p>Similarly the passage dealing with the <em>saññā</em> aspect starts with <em>neva
pathaviyaṁ pathavisaññī</em>, “he is neither conscious (literally ‘percipient’) of
earth in earth”, followed by a long list of negations, only to end up with an
emphatic <em>saññī ca pana assa</em>, “but nevertheless he is conscious”.</p>
<p>So also in the passage which takes up the attending aspect and winds up with the
assertion <em>manasi ca pana kareyya</em>, “and yet he will be attending”.</p>
<p>All this evidence is a pointer to the fact that we have to interpret the
reference to the paradoxical state of consciousness implied by <em>na saññasaññī na
visaññasaññī</em> etc. in the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em> in the light of that unique
concentration of the <em>arahant</em> - the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>This is obvious enough even if we take into consideration the occurrence of the
term <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> in the last line of the verse in question. The worldly
concepts born of the prolific tendency of the mind are rooted in perception.
That is precisely why perception has to be transcended. That is also the reason
for our emphasis on the need for freedom from the six sense-bases and from
contact. The abandonment of <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> is accomplished at this
extraordinary level of concentration.</p>
<p>The immense importance attached to the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> comes to light in
the passages we have quoted. These discourses are abundant proof of the fact
that the Buddha has extolled this <em>samādhi</em> in various ways. The verse beginning
with <em>na saññasaññī na visaññasaññī</em> in particular points to this fact.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion we gave only a clue to its meaning in the form of an
allusion to our simile of the cinema. That is to say, while one is watching a
film show, if the cinema hall is fully illuminated all of a sudden, one
undergoes such an internal transformation, that it becomes questionable whether
he is still seeing the film show. This is because his perception of the film
show has undergone a peculiar change. He is no longer conscious of a film show,
nor has he put an end to consciousness. It is a strange paradox. His gaze is
actually a vacant gaze.</p>
<p>The verse in question expresses such a vacant gaze. When the six sense-bases of
the <em>arahant</em> cease and the lustre of wisdom comes up, giving the conviction
that all assets in the world are empty, the vision in the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>
is as vacant as that gaze of the man at the cinema. It is neither conscious, nor
unconscious, nor non-conscious, nor totally devoid of consciousness. At that
level of concentration even this material form is abandoned.</p>
<p>The line in the paean of joy in the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>, which we came across the
other day, <em>atha rūpā arūpā ca, sukhadukkhā pamuccati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn564-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn564">22</a></sup> “and then from
form and formless and from pleasure and pain is he freed”, can be better
appreciated in the light of the foregoing discussion.</p>
<p>With the relinquishment of all assets, even this body and the experience of a
form and of a formless, as well as pleasure and pain, cease altogether due to
the cessation of contact. That is why Nibbāna is called a bliss devoid of
feeling, <em>avedayita sukha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn565-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn565">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Now as to this vacant gaze, there is much to be said, though one might think
that it is not at all worth discussing about. If someone asks us: “What is the
object of the gaze of one with such a vacant gaze”, what shall we say? The
vacant gaze is, in fact, not established anywhere (<em>appatiṭṭham</em>). It has no
existence (<em>appavattaṁ</em>) and it is object-less (<em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>). Even at the
mention of these three terms, <em>appatiṭṭham, appavattaṁ</em> and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>, some
might recall those highly controversial discourses on Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn566-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn566">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Why do we call the vision of the <em>arahant</em> a vacant gaze? At the highest point
of the development of the three characteristics impermanence, suffering and
not-self, that is, through the three deliverances <em>animitta, appaṇihita</em> and
<em>suññata</em>, the ‘signess’, the ‘undirected’ and the ‘void’, the <em>arahant</em> is now
looking at the object with a penetrative gaze. That is why it is not possible to
say what he is looking at. It is a gaze that sees the cessation of the object, a
gaze that penetrates the object, as it were.</p>
<p>When the cinema hall is fully illuminated, the mind of the one with that vacant
gaze at the film show does not accumulate the stuff that makes up a film. Why?
Because all those cinema preparations are now stilled, cinema assets are
relinquished and the craving and the passion for the cinema film have gone down,
at least temporarily, with the result that the cinema film has ‘ceased’ for him
and he is ‘extinguished’ within. That is why he is looking on with a vacant
gaze. With this illustration one can form an idea about the inner transformation
that occurs in the <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>From the very outset the meditator is concerned with <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or
preparations. Hence the term <em>sabbasaṅkhārasamatha</em>, the stilling of all
preparations, comes first. Instead of the arising aspect of preparations, he
attends to the cessation aspect, the furthest limit of which is Nibbāna. It is
for that reason that the term <em>nirodha</em> is directly applied to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Simply because we have recapitulated the terms forming the theme of our sermons,
some might think that the formula as such is some form of a gross object of the
mind. This, in fact, is the root of the misconception prevalent today.</p>
<p>It is true that the Buddha declared that the <em>arahant</em> has as his perception,
attention and concentration the formula beginning with <em>etaṁ santaṁ etaṁ
paṇītaṁ</em> etc. But this does not mean that the <em>arahant</em> in his <em>samādhi</em> goes on
reciting the formula as we do at the beginning of every sermon.</p>
<p>What it means is that the <em>arahant</em> reverts to or re-attains the realization he
has already won through the lustre of wisdom, namely the realization of the
stilling of all preparations, the relinquishment of all assets, the total
abandonment of the five aggregates, the destruction of craving, dispassion,
cessation and extinguishment. That is what one has to understand by the saying
that the <em>arahant</em> attends to Nibbāna as his object.</p>
<p>The object is cessation, <em>nirodha</em>. Here is something that Māra cannot grasp,
that leaves him utterly clueless. This is why Venerable Nandiya in the
<em>Nandiyatheragāthā</em> challenges Māra in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Obhāsajātaṁ phalagaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>cittaṁ yassa abhiṇhaso,</em> <br />
<em>tādisam bhikkhum āsajja</em> <br />
<em>kaṇha dukkhaṁ nigacchasi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn567-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn567">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The monk whose mind is always bright, <br />
And gone to the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em>, <br />
Should you dare to challenge that monk, <br />
O Blackie, you only come to grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaṇha, Blackie, is one of the epithets of Māra. Even gods and Brahmas are unable
to find out the object of the <em>arahant’s</em> mind when he is in the
<em>phalasamāpatti</em>, the attainment to the fruit. Māra can never discover it. That
is why this attainment is said to leave Māra clueless or deluded (<em>Mārassetaṁ
pamohanaṁ</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn568-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn568">26</a></sup> All this is due to the uniqueness of this level of
concentration.</p>
<p>The three deliverances <em>animitta, appaṇihita</em> and <em>suññata</em>, are indeed
extraordinary and the verse <em>na saññā saññī</em> refers to this
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, which is signless, undirected and void.</p>
<p>Usually one’s vision alights somewhere or picks up some object or other, but
here is a range of vision that has no horizon. In general, there is a horizon at
the furthest end of our range of vision. Standing by the seaside or in a plain,
one gazes upon a horizon where the earth and sky meet. The worldling’s range of
vision, in general, has such a horizon. But the <em>arahant’s</em> range of vision, as
here described, has no such horizon. That is why it is called <em>anantaṁ</em>, endless
or infinite. <em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em>, “the
non-manifestative consciousness, endless, lustrous on all sides.”</p>
<p>That vacant gaze is an ‘endless’ perception. One who has it cannot be called
conscious, <em>saññī</em>. Nor can he be called unconscious, <em>visaññī</em> – in the worldly
sense of the term. Nor is he devoid of consciousness, <em>asaññī</em>. Nor has he put
an end to consciousness, <em>vibhūtasaññī</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now take up two verses which shed a flood of light on the foregoing
discussion and help illuminate the meaning of canonical passages that might come
up later. The two verses are from the <em>Arahantavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi,</em> <br />
<em>ye pariññāta bhojanā,</em> <br />
<em>suññato animitto ca,</em> <br />
<em>vimokkho yesa gocaro,</em> <br />
<em>ākāse va sakuntānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>gati tesaṁ durannayā.</em></p>
<p><em>Yass’āsavā parikkhīṇā,</em> <br />
<em>āhāre ca anissito,</em> <br />
<em>suññato animitto ca,</em> <br />
<em>vimokkho yassa gocaro,</em> <br />
<em>ākāse va sakuntānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn569-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn569">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Those who have no accumulations, <br />
And understood fully the subject of food, <br />
And whose feeding ground <br />
Is the void and the signless, <br />
Their track is hard to trace, <br />
Like that of birds in the sky.</p>
<p>He whose influxes are extinct, <br />
And is unattached to nutriment, <br />
Whose range is the deliverance, <br />
Of the void and the signless, <br />
His path is hard to trace, <br />
Like that of birds in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accumulation here meant is not of material things, such as food. It is the
accumulation of karma and <em>upadhi</em>, assets. The comprehension of food could be
taken to imply the comprehension of all four nutriments, namely gross material
food, contact, will and consciousness. The feeding ground of such <em>arahants</em> is
the void and the signless. Hence their track is hard to trace, like that of
birds in the sky.</p>
<p>The term <em>gati</em>, which we rendered by ‘track’, has been differently interpreted
in the commentary. For the commentary <em>gati</em> is the place where the <em>arahant</em>
goes after death, his next bourne, so to speak.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn570-1"><a href="sermon-16.html#fn-fn570">28</a></sup></p>
<p>But taken in conjunction with the simile used, <em>gati</em> obviously means the
‘path’, <em>padaṁ</em>, taken by the birds in the sky. It is the path they take that
cannot be traced, not their destination.</p>
<p>Where the birds have gone could perhaps be traced, with some difficulty. They
may have gone to their nests. It is the path they went by that is referred to as
<em>gati</em> in this context. Just as when birds fly through the sky they do not leave
behind any trace of a path, even so in this concentration of the <em>arahant</em> there
is no object or sign of any continuity.</p>
<p>The second verse gives almost the same idea. It is in singular and speaks of an
<em>arahant</em> whose influxes are extinct and who is unattached to nutriment. Here,
in the simile about the birds in the sky, we find the word <em>padaṁ</em>, ‘path’, used
instead of <em>gati</em>, which makes it clear enough that it is not the destiny of the
<em>arahant</em> that is spoken of.</p>
<p>The commentary, however, interprets both <em>gati</em> and <em>padaṁ</em> as a reference to
the <em>arahant’s</em> destiny. There is a tacit assumption of some mysterious
<em>anupādisesa Nibbānadhātu</em>. But what we have here is a metaphor of considerable
depth. The reference is to that unique <em>samādhi</em>.</p>
<p>The bird’s flight through the air symbolizes the flight of the mind. In the case
of others, the path taken by the mind can be traced through the object it takes,
but not in this case. The key word that highlights the metaphorical meaning of
these verses is <em>gocaro</em>. <em>Gocara</em> means ‘pasture’. Now, in the case of cattle
roaming in their pasture one can trace them by their footsteps, by the path
trodden. What about the pasture of the <em>arahants</em>?</p>
<p>Of course, they too consume food to maintain their bodies, but their true
‘pasture’ is the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. As soon as they get an opportunity,
they take to this pasture. Once they are well within this pasture, neither gods
nor Brahmas nor Māra can find them. That is why the path taken by the <em>arahants</em>
in the <em>phalasamādhi</em> cannot be traced, like the track of birds in the sky.</p>
<p>We have yet to discuss the subject of <em>sa-upādisesa</em> and <em>anupādisesa
Nibbānadhātu</em>. But even at this point some clarity of understanding might
emerge. When the <em>arahant</em> passes away, at the last moment of his life span, he
brings his mind to this <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. Then not even Māra can trace
him. There is no possibility of a rebirth and that is the end of all. It is this
‘extinction’ that is referred to here.</p>
<p>This extinction is not something one gets in a world beyond. It is a realization
here and now, in this world. And the <em>arahant</em>, by way of blissful dwelling here
and now, enjoys in his every day life the supreme bliss of Nibbāna that he had
won through the incomparable deliverances of the mind.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the seventeenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon, we tried to analyse some discourses that give us a clue to
understand what sort of an experience an <em>arahant</em> has in his realization of the
cessation of existence in the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>We happened to mention that the <em>arahant</em> sees the cessation of existence with a
deeply penetrative vision of the void that may be compared to a gaze that knows
no horizon. We also dropped the hint that the non-manifestative consciousness,
endless and lustrous on all sides, we had spoken of in an earlier
sermon,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn572-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn572">2</a></sup> is an explicit reference to this same experience.</p>
<p>How the <em>arahant</em>, ranging in his triple pasture of the signless deliverance,
the undirected deliverance and the void deliverance, <em>animitta vimokkha</em>,
<em>appaṇihita vimokkha</em> and <em>suññata vimokkha</em>, gets free from the latency to
perception, transcends the duality of form and formless, and crosses over this
ocean of existence unhindered by Māra, has been described in various ways in
various discourses.</p>
<p>Let us now take up for discussion in this connection three significant verses
that are found in the <em>Itivuttaka</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpūpagā sattā</em> <br />
<em>ye ca arūpaṭṭhāyino,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhaṁ appajānantā</em> <br />
<em>āgantāro punabbhavaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpe pariññāya,</em> <br />
<em>arūpesu asaṇṭhitā,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhe ye vimuccanti,</em> <br />
<em>te janā maccuhāyino.</em></p>
<p><em>Kāyena amataṁ dhātuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>phusaytivā nirūpadhiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>upadhipaṭinissaggaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sacchikatvā anāsavo,</em> <br />
<em>deseti sammāsambuddho,</em> <br />
<em>asokaṁ virajaṁ padaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn573-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn573">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Those beings that go to realms of form, <br />
And those who are settled in formless realms, <br />
Not understanding the fact of cessation, <br />
Come back again and again to existence.</p>
<p>Those who, having comprehended realms of form, <br />
Do not settle in formless realms, <br />
Are released in the experience of cessation, <br />
It is they that are the dispellers of death.</p>
<p>Having touched with the body the deathless element, <br />
Which is asset-less, <br />
And realized the relinquishment of assets, <br />
Being influx-free, the perfectly enlightened one, <br />
Proclaims the sorrow-less, taintless state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of the first verse is clear enough. Those who are in realms of form
and formless realms are reborn again and again due to not understanding the fact
of cessation.</p>
<p>In the case of the second verse, there is some confusion as to the correct
reading. We have mentioned earlier, too, that some of the deep discourses
present considerable difficulty in determining what the correct reading
is.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn574-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn574">4</a></sup> They have not come down with sufficient clarity. Where the meaning
is not clear enough, there is a likelihood for the oral tradition to become
corrupt. Here we accepted the reading <em>asaṇṭhitā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpe pariññāya,</em> <br />
<em>arūpesu asaṇṭhitā,</em></p>
<p>Those who, having comprehended realms of form, <br />
Do not settle in formless realms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is the variant reading <em>susaṇṭhitā</em>, which gives the meaning ‘settled
well’. The two readings contradict each other and so we have a problem here. The
commentary accepts the reading <em>asaṇṭhitā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn575-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn575">5</a></sup> We too followed it, for some
valid reason and not simply because it accords with the commentary.</p>
<p>However, in several modern editions of the text, the reading <em>asaṇṭhitā</em> has
been replaced by <em>susaṇṭhitā</em>, probably because it seems to make sense, prima
facie.</p>
<p>But, as we pointed out in this series of sermons, there is the question of the
dichotomy between the form and the formless. The formless, or <em>arūpa</em>, is like
the shadow of form, <em>rūpa</em>. Therefore, when one comprehends form, one also
understands that the formless, too, is not worthwhile settling in. It is in that
sense that we brought in the reading <em>asaṇṭhitā</em> in this context.</p>
<p>Those who have fully comprehended form, do not depend on the formless either,
and it is they that are released in the realization of cessation. They transcend
the duality of form and formless and, by directing their minds to the cessation
of existence, attain emancipation.</p>
<p>In the last verse it is said that the Buddha realized the relinquishment of
assets known as <em>nirupadhi</em>, the ‘asset-less’. It also says that he touched the
deathless element with the body. In a previous sermon we happened to quote a
verse from the <em>Udāna</em> which had the conclusive lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Phusanti phassā upadhiṁ paṭicca,</em> <br />
<em>Nirupadhiṁ kena phuseyyum phassā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn576-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn576">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Touches touch one because of assets, <br />
How can touches touch him who is asset-less?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to this verse, it seems that here there is no touch. So what we have
stated above might even appear as contradictory. The above verse speaks of a
‘touching’ of the deathless element with the body. One might ask how one can
touch, when there is no touch at all? But here we have an extremely deep idea,
almost a paradox.</p>
<p>To be free from touch is in itself the ‘touching’ of the deathless element.</p>
<p>What we mean to say is that, as far as the fear of death is concerned, here we
have the freedom from the pain of death and in fact the freedom from the concept
of death itself.</p>
<p>The Buddha and the <em>arahants</em>, with the help of that wisdom, while in that
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> described as <em>anāsavā cetovimutti paññāvimutti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn577-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn577">7</a></sup>
or <em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn578-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn578">8</a></sup> let go of their entire body and realized the
cessation of existence, thereby freeing themselves from touch and feeling. That
is why Nibbāna is called a bliss devoid of feeling, <em>avedayita sukha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn579-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn579">9</a></sup></p>
<p>This giving up, this letting go when Māra is coming to grab and seize, is a very
subtle affair. To give up and let go when Māra comes to grab is to touch the
deathless, because thereby one is freed from touch and feelings. Here, then, we
have a paradox. So subtle is this Dhamma!</p>
<p>How does one realize cessation? By attending to the cessation aspect of
preparations.</p>
<p>As we have already mentioned, to arise and to cease is of the nature of
preparations, and here the attention is on the ceasing aspect. The worldlings in
general pay attention to the arising aspect. They can see only that aspect. The
Buddhas, on the other hand, have seen the cessation of existence in a subtle
way. The culmination of the practice of paying attention to the cessation aspect
of preparations is the realization of the cessation of existence.</p>
<p><em>Bhava</em>, or existence, is the domain of Māra. How does one escape from the grip
of Māra? By going beyond his range of vision, that is to say by attending to the
cessation of existence, <em>bhavanirodha</em>.</p>
<p>All experiences of pleasure and pain are there so long as one is in <em>bhava</em>. The
<em>arahant</em> wins to the freedom from form and formless and from pleasure and pain,
as it was said in a verse already quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atha rūpā arūpā ca,</em> <br />
<em>sukhadukkhā pamuccati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn580-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn580">10</a></sup></p>
<p>And then from form and formless, <br />
And from pleasure and pain is he freed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We explained that verse as a reference to <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. Here, too, we
are on the same point. The concept of the cessation of existence is indeed very
deep. It is so deep that one might wonder whether there is anything worthwhile
in Nibbāna, if it is equivalent to the cessation of existence.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we do come across an important discourse among the Tens of
the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, where Nibbāna is explicitly called <em>bhavanirodha</em>. It is
in the form of a dialogue between Venerable Ānanda and Venerable Sāriputta. As
usual, Venerable Ānanda is enquiring about that extraordinary <em>samādhi</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Siyā nu kho, āvuso Sāriputta, bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā neva
pathaviyaṁ pathavisaññī assa, na āpasmiṁ āposaññī assa, na tejasmiṁ tejosaññī
assa, na vāyasmiṁ vāyosaññī assa, na ākāsānañcāyatane ākāsānañcāyatanasaññī
assa, na viññāṇañcāyatane viññāṇancāyatanasaññī assa, na ākiñcaññāyatane
ākiñcaññāyatanasaññī assa, na nevasaññānāsaññāyatane
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasaññī assa, na idhaloke idhalokasaññī assa, na paraloke
paralokasaññī assa, – saññī ca pana assa?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn581-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn581">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Could there be, friend Sāriputta, for a monk such an attainment of
concentration wherein he will not be conscious of earth in earth, nor of water
in water, nor of fire in fire, nor of air in air, nor will he be conscious of
the sphere of infinite space in the sphere of infinite space, nor of the
sphere of infinite consciousness in the sphere of infinite consciousness, nor
of the sphere of nothingness in the sphere of nothingness, nor of the sphere
of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, nor of a this world in this world, nor
of a world beyond in a world beyond – and yet he will be conscious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta’s reply to it is: “There could be, friend Ānanda.” Then
Venerable Ānanda asks again: “But then, friend Sāriputta, in which manner could
there be such an attainment of concentration for a monk?”</p>
<p>At that point Venerable Sāriputta comes out with his own experience, revealing
that he himself once attained to such a <em>samādhi</em>, when he was at <em>Andhavana</em> in
<em>Sāvatthī</em>. Venerable Ānanda, however, is still curious to ascertain what sort
of perception he was having, when he was in that <em>samādhi</em>. The explanation
given by Venerable Sāriputta in response to it, is of utmost importance. It
runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ, bhavanirodho nibbānan’ti kho me, avuso, aññā’va saññā
uppajjati aññā’va saññā nirujjhati.</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, āvuso, sakalikaggissa jhāyamānassa aññā’va acci uppajjati,
aññā’va acci nirujjhati, evam eva kho me āvuso bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ,
bhavanirodho nibbānam’ti aññā’va saññā uppajjati aññā’va saññā nirujjhati,
bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ saññī ca panāhaṁ, āvuso, tasmiṁ samaye ahosiṁ.</em></p>
<p>One perception arises in me, friend: ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’,
‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’, and another perception fades out in me:
‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’, ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’.</p>
<p>Just as, friend, in the case of a twig fire, when it is burning one flame
arises and another flame fades out. Even so, friend, one perception arises in
me: ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’, ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’,
and another perception fades out in me: ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’,
‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’, at that time, friend, I was of the
perception ‘cessation of existence is Nibbāna’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true significance of the simile of the twig fire is that Venerable Sāriputta
was attending to the cessation aspect of preparations. As we mentioned in
connection with the formula <em>etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ,</em> “this is peaceful, this
is excellent”, occurring in a similar context, we are not to conclude that
Venerable Sāriputta kept on repeating “cessation of existence is Nibbāna”.</p>
<p>The insight into a flame could be different from a mere sight of a flame.
Worldlings in general see only a process of burning in a flame. To the insight
meditator it can appear as an intermittent series of extinctions. It is the
outcome of a penetrative vision. Just like the flame, which simulates
compactness, existence, too, is a product of <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations.</p>
<p>The worldling who attends to the arising aspect and ignores the cessation aspect
is carried away by the perception of the compact. But the mind, when steadied,
is able to see the phenomenon of cessation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ṭhitaṁ cittaṁ vippamuttaṁ, vayañcassānupassati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn582-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn582">12</a></sup></p>
<p>the mind steadied and released contemplates its own passing away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that steadied mind the <em>arahant</em> attends to the cessation of preparations.
At its climax, he penetrates the gamut of existence made up of preparations, as
in the case of a flame, and goes beyond the clutches of death.</p>
<p>As a comparison for existence, the simile of the flame is quite apt. We happened
to point out earlier, that the word <em>upādāna</em> can mean “grasping” as well as
“fuel”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn583-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn583">13</a></sup> The totality of existence is sometimes referred to as a
fire.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn584-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn584">14</a></sup> The fuel for the fire of existence is grasping itself. With the
removal of that fuel, one experiences extinction.</p>
<p>The dictum <em>bhavanirodho nibbānam</em> clearly shows that Nibbāna is the cessation
of existence. There is another significant discourse which equates Nibbāna to
the experience of the cessation of the six sense-bases, <em>saḷāyatananirodha</em>. The
same experience of realization is viewed from a different angle. We have already
shown that the cessation of the six sense-bases, or the six sense-spheres, is
also called Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn585-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn585">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The discourse we are now going to take up is one in which the Buddha presented
the theme as some sort of a riddle for the monks to work out for themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, se āyatane veditabbe yattha cakkhuñca nirujjhati
rūpasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha sotañca nirujjhati
saddasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha ghānañca nirujjhati
gandhasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha jivhā ca nirujjhati
rasasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha kāyo ca nirujjhati
phoṭṭabbasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha mano ca nirujjhati
dhammasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe, se āyatane veditabbe.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn586-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn586">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, monks, that sphere should be known wherein the eye ceases and
perceptions of form fade away, that sphere should be known wherein the ear
ceases and perceptions of sound fade away, that sphere should be known wherein
the nose ceases and perceptions of smell fade away, that sphere should be
known wherein the tongue ceases and perceptions of taste fade away, that
sphere should be known wherein the body ceases and perceptions of the tangible
fade away, that sphere should be known wherein the mind ceases and perceptions
of mind objects fade away, that sphere should be known, that sphere should be
known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some peculiarity in the very wording of the passage, when it says, for
instance, that the eye ceases, <em>cakkhuñca nirujjhati</em> and perceptions of form
fade away, <em>rūpasaññā ca virajjati</em>. As we once pointed out, the word <em>virāga</em>,
usually rendered by ‘detachment’, has a nuance equivalent to ‘fading away’ or
‘decolouration’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn587-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn587">17</a></sup> Here that nuance is clearly evident. When the eye
ceases, perceptions of forms fade away.</p>
<p>The Buddha is enjoining the monks to understand that sphere, not disclosing what
it is, in which the eye ceases and perceptions of form fade away, and likewise
the ear ceases and perceptions of sound fade away, the nose ceases and
perceptions of smell fade away, the tongue ceases and perceptions of taste fade
away, the body ceases and perceptions of the tangible fade away, and last of all
even the mind ceases and perceptions of mind objects fade away. This last is
particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Without giving any clue to the meaning of this brief exhortation, the Buddha got
up and entered the monastery, leaving the monks perplexed. Wondering how they
could get it explained, they approached Venerable Ānanda and begged him to
comment at length on what the Buddha had preached in brief.</p>
<p>With some modest reluctance, Venerable Ānanda complied, urging that his comment
be reported to the Buddha for confirmation. His comments, however, amounted to
just one sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saḷāyatananirodhaṁ, kho āvuso, Bhagavatā sandhāya bhāsitaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Friends, it is with reference to the cessation of the six sense-spheres that
the Exalted One has preached this sermon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When those monks approached the Buddha and placed Venerable Ānanda’s explanation
before him, the Buddha ratified it. Hence it is clear that the term <em>āyatana</em> in
the above passage refers not to any one of the six sense-spheres, but to
Nibbāna, which is the cessation of all of them.</p>
<p>The commentator, Venerable Buddhaghosa, too accepts this position in his
commentary to the passage in question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saḷāyatananirodhan’ti saḷāyatananirodho vuccati nibbānam, tam sandhāya
bhāsitan ti attho</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn588-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn588">18</a></sup></p>
<p>the cessation of the six sense-spheres, what is called the cessation of the
six sense-spheres is Nibbāna, the meaning is that the Buddha’s sermon is a
reference to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The passage in question bears testimony to two important facts. Firstly that
Nibbāna is called the cessation of the six sense-spheres. Secondly that this
experience is referred to as an <em>āyatana</em>, or a ‘sphere’.</p>
<p>The fact that Nibbāna is sometimes called <em>āyatana</em> is further corroborated by a
certain passage in the <em>Saḷāyatanvibhaṅgasutta</em>, which defines the term
<em>nekkhammasita domanassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn589-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn589">19</a></sup> In that discourse, which deals with some
deeper aspects of the Dhamma, the concept of <em>nekkhammasita domanassa</em>, or
“unhappiness connected with renunciation”, is explained as follows:</p>
<p>If one contemplates with insight wisdom the sense-objects like forms and sounds
as impermanent, suffering-fraught and transient, and develops a longing for
Nibbāna, due to that longing or expectation one might feel an unhappiness. It is
such an unhappiness which, however, is superior to an unhappiness connected with
the household life, that is called <em>nekkhammasita domanassa</em>, or “unhappiness
connected with renunciation”.</p>
<p>How such an unhappiness may arise in a monk is described in that discourse in
the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Kudāssu nāmāhaṁ tadāyatanaṁ upasampajja viharissāmi yadariyā etarahi āyatanaṁ
upasampajja viharanti?’ iti anuttaresu vimokkhesu pihaṁ upaṭṭhāpayato
uppajjati pihāpaccayā domanassaṁ. Yaṁ evarūpaṁ domanassaṁ idaṁ vuccati
nekkhammasitadomanassaṁ.</em></p>
<p>‘O, when shall I attain to and dwell in that sphere to which the Noble Ones
now attain and dwell in?’ Thus, as he sets up a longing for the incomparable
deliverances, there arises an unhappiness due to that longing. It is such an
unhappiness that is called unhappiness connected with renunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are called ‘incomparable deliverances’ are the three doorways to Nibbāna,
the signless, the undirected and the void. We can therefore conclude that the
sphere to which this monk aspires is none other than Nibbāna. So here we have a
second instance of a reference to Nibbāna as a ‘sphere’ or <em>āyatana</em>.</p>
<p>Now let us bring up a third:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ, yattha n’eva pathavī na āpo na tejo na vāyo
na ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ na viññāṇānañcāyatanaṁ na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ na
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ na ayaṁ loko na paraloko na ubho candimasūriyā. Tatra
p’ahaṁ bhikkhave, n’eva āgatiṁ vadāmi na gatiṁ na ṭhitiṁ na cutiṁ na
upapattiṁ, appatiṭṭhaṁ appavattaṁ anārammaṇaṁ eva taṁ. Es’ev’anto
dukkhassā’ti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn590-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn590">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, this happens to be the most controversial passage on Nibbāna.
Scholars, both ancient and modern, have put forward various interpretations of
this much vexed passage. Its riddle-like presentation has posed a challenge to
many a philosopher bent on determining what Nibbāna is.</p>
<p>This brief discourse comes in the <em>Udāna</em> as an inspired utterance of the Buddha
on the subject of Nibbāna, <em>Nibbānapaṭisamyuttasutta</em>. To begin with, we shall
try to give a somewhat literal translation of the passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there is that sphere, wherein there is neither earth, nor water, nor
fire, nor air; neither the sphere of infinite space, nor the sphere of
infinite consciousness, nor the sphere of nothingness, nor the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception; neither this world nor the world
beyond, nor the sun and the moon. There, monks, I say, is no coming, no going,
no staying, no passing away and no arising; it is not established, it is not
continuing, it has no object. This, itself, is the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of getting down to the commentarial interpretation at the very outset,
let us try to understand this discourse on the lines of the interpretation we
have so far developed. We have already come across two references to Nibbāna as
an <em>āyatana</em> or a sphere. In the present context, too, the term <em>āyatana</em> is an
allusion to <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. Its significance, therefore, is
psychological.</p>
<p>First of all we are told that earth, water, fire and air are not there in that
<em>āyatana</em>. This is understandable, since in a number of discourses dealing with
<em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> and <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> we came across similar
statements.</p>
<p>It is said that in <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>, or non-manifestative consciousness,
earth, water, fire and air do not find a footing. Similarly, when one is in
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, one is said to be devoid of the perception of earth in
earth, for instance, because he does not attend to it. So the peculiar negative
formulation of the above <em>Udāna</em> passage is suggestive of the fact that these
elements do not exercise any influence on the mind of one who is in
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>The usual interpretation, however, is that it describes some kind of a place or
a world devoid of those elements. It is generally believed that the passage in
question is a description of the ‘sphere’ into which the <em>arahant</em> passes away,
that is, his after death ‘state’. This facile explanation is often presented
only as a tacit assumption, for fear of being accused of heretical views. But it
must be pointed out that the allusion here is to a certain level of experience
of the living <em>arahant</em>, namely the realization, here and now, of the cessation
of existence, <em>bhavanirodha</em>.</p>
<p>The four elements have no part to play in that experience. The sphere of
infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness etc. also do not come in,
as we have already shown with reference to a number of discourses. So it is free
from both form and formless.</p>
<p>The statement that there is neither this world nor a world beyond could be
understood in the light of the phrase,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>na idhaloke idhalokasaññī, na paraloke paralokasaññī</em>,</p>
<p>percipient neither of a this world in this world, nor of a world beyond in a
world beyond</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that came up in a passage discussed above.</p>
<p>The absence of the moon and the sun, <em>na ubho candima sūriyā</em>, in this sphere,
is taken as the strongest argument in favour of concluding that Nibbāna is some
kind of a place, a place where there is no moon or sun.</p>
<p>But as we have explained in the course of our discussion of the term <em>anidassana
viññāṇa</em>, or non-manifestative consciousness, with the cessation of the six
sense-spheres, due to the all lustrous nature of the mind, sun and moon lose
their lustre, though the senses are all intact. Their lustre is superseded by
the lustre of wisdom. They pale away and fade into insignificance before it. It
is in this sense that the moon and the sun are said to be not there in that
sphere.</p>
<p>Why there is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away and no arising,
can be understood in the light of what we have observed in earlier sermons on
the question of relative concepts.</p>
<p>The verbal dichotomy characteristic of worldly concepts is reflected in this
reference to a coming and a going etc. The <em>arahant</em> in <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>
is free from the limitations imposed by this verbal dichotomy.</p>
<p>The three terms <em>appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ</em> and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>, ‘not established’,
‘not continuing’ and ‘objectless’, are suggestive of the three doorways to
deliverance.</p>
<p><em>Appatiṭṭhaṁ</em> refers to <em>appaṇihita vimokkha</em>, ‘undirected deliverance’, which
comes through the extirpation of craving.</p>
<p><em>Appavattaṁ</em> stands for <em>suññata vimokkha</em>, the ‘void deliverance’, which is the
negation of continuity.</p>
<p><em>Anārammaṇaṁ</em> is clearly enough a reference to <em>animitta vimokkha</em>, the
‘signless deliverance’. Not to have an object is to be signless.</p>
<p>The concluding sentence “this itself is the end of suffering” is therefore a
clear indication that the end of suffering is reached here and now. It does not
mean that the <em>arahant</em> gets half of Nibbāna here and the other half ‘there’.</p>
<p>Our line of interpretation leads to such a conclusion, but of course, in case
there are shortcomings in it, we could perhaps improve on it by having recourse
to the commentarial interpretation.</p>
<p>Now as to the commentarial interpretation, this is how the <em>Udāna</em> commentary
explains the points we have discussed:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn591-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn591">21</a></sup> It paraphrases the term <em>āyatana</em>
by <em>kāraṇa</em>, observing that it means reason in this context. Just as much as
forms stand in relation of an object to the eye, so the <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, or
the ‘unprepared element’, is said to be an object to the <em>arahant’s</em> mind, and
here it is called <em>āyatana</em>.</p>
<p>Then the commentary raises the question, why earth, water, fire and air are not
there in that <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>. The four elements are representative of things
prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>. There cannot be any mingling or juxtaposition between the
<em>saṅkhata</em> and the <em>asaṅkhata</em>. That is why earth, water, fire and air are not
supposed to be there, in that <em>āyatana</em>.</p>
<p>The question why there are no formless states, like the sphere of infinite
space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, is similarly explained, while
asserting that Nibbāna is nevertheless formless.</p>
<p>Since in Nibbāna one has transcended the sensuous sphere, <em>kāmaloka</em>, the
concepts of a this world and a world beyond are said to be irrelevant. As to why
the sun and the moon are not there, the commentary gives the following
explanation:</p>
<p>In realms of form there is generally darkness, to dispel which there must be a
sun and a moon. But Nibbāna is not a realm of form, so how could sun and moon
come in?</p>
<p>Then what about the reference to a coming, a going, a staying, a passing away
and an arising? No one comes to Nibbāna from anywhere and no one goes out from
it, no one stays in it or passes away or reappears in it.</p>
<p>Now all this is mystifying enough. But the commentary goes on to interpret the
three terms <em>appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ</em> and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em> also in the same vein.
Only that which has form gets established and Nibbāna is formless, therefore it
is not established anywhere. Nibbāna does not continue, so it is <em>appavattaṁ</em>,
or non-continuing. Since Nibbāna takes no object, it is objectless,
<em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>. It is as good as saying that, though one may take Nibbāna as an
object, Nibbāna itself takes no object.</p>
<p>So this is what the traditional interpretation amounts to. If there are any
shortcomings in our explanation, one is free to go for the commentarial. But it
is obvious that there is a lot of confusion in this commentarial trend.
Insufficient appreciation of the deep concept of the cessation of existence
seems to have caused all this confusion.</p>
<p>More often than otherwise, commentarial interpretations of Nibbāna leaves room
for some subtle craving for existence, <em>bhavataṇhā</em>. It gives a vague idea of a
place or a sphere, <em>āyatana</em>, which serves as a surrogate destination for the
<em>arahants</em> after their demise. Though not always explicitly asserted, it is at
least tacitly suggested. The description given above is ample proof of this
trend. It conjures up a place where there is no sun and no moon, a place that is
not a place. Such confounding trends have crept in probably due to the very
depth of this Dhamma.</p>
<p>Deep indeed is this Dhamma and hard to comprehend, as the Buddha once confided
in Venerable Sāriputta with a trace of tiredness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saṅkhittenapi kho ahaṁ, Sāriputta, dhammaṁ deseyyaṁ, vitthārenapi kho ahaṁ,
Sāriputta, dhammaṁ deseyyaṁ, saṅkhittenavitthārenapi kho ahaṁ, Sāriputta,
dhammaṁ deseyyaṁ, aññātāro ca dullabhā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn592-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn592">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether I were to preach in brief, Sāriputta, or whether I were to preach in
detail, Sāriputta, or whether I were to preach both in brief or in detail,
Sāriputta, rare are those who understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta implores the Buddha to preach in brief, in detail and
both in brief and in detail, saying that there will be those who understand. In
response to it the Buddha gives the following instruction to Venerable
Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, Sāriputta, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ: ’Imasmiñca saviññāṇake kāye
ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā na bhavissanti, bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu
ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā na bhavissanti, yañca cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ
upasampajja viharato ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā na honti, tañca cetovimuttiṁ
paññāvimuttiṁ upasampajja viharissāmā’ti. Evañhi kho, Sāriputta,
sikkhitabbaṁ,</em></p>
<p>If that is so, Sāriputta, you all should train yourselves thus: In this
conscious body and in all external signs there shall be no latencies to
conceits in terms of I-ing and my-ing, and we will attain to and dwell in that
deliverance of the mind and that deliverance through wisdom whereby no such
latencies to conceits of I-ing and my-ing will arise. Thus should you all
train yourselves!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha goes on to declare the final outcome of that training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayaṁ vuccati, Sāriputta, bhikkhu acchecchi taṇhaṁ vāvattayi saṁyojanaṁ sammā
mānābhisamayā antam akāsi dukkhassa</em>.</p>
<p>Such a monk, Sāriputta, is called one who has cut off craving, turned back
the fetters, and by rightly understanding conceit for what it is, has made an
end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find the Buddha summing up his exhortation by quoting two verses from a sutta
in the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which he himself had preached to
the Brahmin youth Udaya.</p>
<p>We may mention in passing that among canonical texts, the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> was
held in high esteem so much so that in a number of discourses the Buddha is seen
quoting from it, particularly from the two sections <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> and
<em>Pārāyanavagga</em>. Now the two verses he quotes in this instance from the
<em>Pārāyanavagga</em> are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pahānaṁ kāmacchandānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>domanassāna cūbhayaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>thīṇassa ca panūdanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kukkuccānaṁ nivāraṇaṁ,</em></p>
<p><em>Upekhāsatisaṁsuddhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dhammatakkapurejavaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>aññāvimokhaṁ pabrūmi,</em> <br />
<em>avijjāyappabhedanaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn593-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn593">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The abandonment of both sensuous perceptions, <br />
And unpleasant mental states, <br />
The dispelling of torpidity, <br />
And the warding off of remorse,</p>
<p>The purity born of equanimity and mindfulness, <br />
With thoughts of Dhamma forging ahead, <br />
And blasting ignorance, <br />
This I call the deliverance through full understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ample proof of the fact that the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> is also called
<em>aññāvimokkha</em>. Among the Nines of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> we come across another
discourse which throws more light on the subject. Here Venerable Ānanda is
addressing a group of monks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchariyaṁ, āvuso, abbhutam, āvuso, yāvañcidaṁ tena Bhagavatā jānatā passatā
arahatā sammāsambuddhena sambādhe okāsādhigamo anubuddho sattānaṁ visuddhiyā
sokapariddavānaṁ samatikkamāya dukkhadomanassānaṁ atthaṅgamāya ñāyassa
adhigamāya nibbānassa sacchikiriyāya.</em></p>
<p><em>Tadeva nāma cakkhuṁ bhavissati te rūpā tañcāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedissati.
Tadeva nāma sotaṁ bhavissati te saddā tañcāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedissati. Tadeva
nāma ghānaṁ bhavissati te gandhā tañcāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedissati. Sā ca nāma
jivhā bhavissati te rasā tañcāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedissati. So ca nāma kāyo
bhavissati te phoṭṭhabbā tañcāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedissati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn594-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn594">24</a></sup></p>
<p>It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous, friends, that the Exalted One who
knows and sees, that Worthy One, fully enlightened, has discovered an
opportunity in obstructing circumstances for the purification of beings, for
the transcending of sorrow and lamentation, for the ending of pain and
unhappiness, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In as much as that same eye will be there, those forms will be there, but one
will not be experiencing the appropriate sense-sphere. That same ear will be
there, those sounds will be there, but one will not be experiencing the
appropriate sense-sphere. That same nose will be there, those smells will be
there, but one will not be experiencing the appropriate sense-sphere. That
same tongue will be there, those flavours will be there, but one will not be
experiencing the appropriate sense-sphere. That same body will be there, those
tangibles will be there, but one will not be experiencing the appropriate
sense-sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is so wonderful and marvellous about this newly discovered opportunity is
that, though apparently the senses and their corresponding objects come
together, there is no experience of the appropriate spheres of sense contact.
When Venerable Ānanda had described this extraordinary level of experience in
these words, Venerable Udāyī raised the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññīmeva nu kho āvuso Ānanda, tadāyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedeti udāhu asaññī?</em></p>
<p>Friend, is it the fact that while being conscious one is not experiencing that
sphere or is he unconscious at that time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda affirms that it is while being conscious, <em>saññīmeva</em>, that
such a thing happens. Venerable Udāyī’s cross-question gives us a further clue
to the riddle like verse we discussed earlier, beginning with <em>na sañña saññī na
visañña saññī</em>.</p>
<p>It is indeed puzzling why one does not experience those sense-objects, though
one is conscious. As if to drive home the point, Venerable Ānanda relates how he
once answered a related question put to him by the nun <em>Jaṭilagāhiyā</em> when he
was staying at the Deer park in <em>Añjanavana</em> in <em>Sāketa</em>. The question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yāyaṁ, bhante Ānanda, samādhi na cābhinato na cāpanato na ca
sasaṅkhāraniggayhavāritavato, vimuttattā ṭhito, ṭhitattā santusito,
santusitattā no paritassati. Ayaṁ, bhante, samādhi kiṁphalo vutto Bhagavatā?</em></p>
<p>That concentration, Venerable Ānanda, which is neither turned towards nor
turned outwards, which is not a vow constrained by preparations, one that is
steady because of freedom, contented because of steadiness and not hankering
because of contentment, Venerable Sir, with what fruit has the Exalted One
associated that concentration?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question looks so highly compressed that the key words in it might need some
clarification. The two terms <em>abhinata</em> and <em>apanata</em> are suggestive of lust and
hate, as well as introversion and extroversion. This concentration is free from
these extreme attitudes.</p>
<p>Whereas in ordinary concentration <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations, exercise some
degree of control as the term <em>vikkhambhana</em>, ‘propping up’, ‘suppression’,
suggests, here there is no implication of any forcible action as in a vow. Here
the steadiness is born of freedom from that very constriction.</p>
<p>Generally, the steadiness characteristic of a level of concentration is not much
different from the apparent steadiness of a spinning top. It is the spinning
that keeps the top up. But here the very freedom from that spinning has brought
about a steadiness of a higher order, which in its turn gives rise to
contentment.</p>
<p>The kind of peace and contentment that comes with <em>samādhi</em> in general is
brittle and irritable. That is why it is sometimes called <em>kuppa paṭicca santi</em>,
“peace subject to irritability”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn595-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn595">25</a></sup> Here, on the contrary, there is no such
irritability.</p>
<p>We can well infer from this that the allusion is to <em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>,
“unshakeable deliverance of the mind”. The kind of contentment born of freedom
and stability is so perfect that it leaves no room for hankering, <em>paritassanā</em>.</p>
<p>However, the main point of the question posed by that nun amounts to this: What
sort of a fruit does a <em>samādhi</em> of this description entail, according to the
words of the Exalted One?</p>
<p>After relating the circumstances connected with the above question as a flash
back, Venerable Ānanda finally comes out with the answer he had given to the
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yāyaṁ, bhagini, samādhi na cābhinato na cāpanato na ca
sasaṅkhāraniggayhavāritavato, vimuttattā ṭhito, ṭhitattā santusito,
santusitattā no paritassati, ayaṁ, bhagini, samādhi aññāphalo vutto
Bhagavatā</em>.</p>
<p>Sister, that concentration which is neither turned towards nor turned
outwards, which is not a vow constrained by preparations, one that is steady
because of freedom, contented because of steadiness and not hankering because
of contentment, that concentration, sister, has been declared by the Buddha to
have full understanding as its fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Aññā</em>, or full understanding, is one that comes with realization conferring
certitude and it is the fruit of the concentration described above. Then, as if
coming back to the point, Venerable Ānanda adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ saññīpi kho, āvuso, tad āyatanaṁ no paṭisaṁvedeti.</em></p>
<p>Being thus conscious, too, friend, one does not experience an appropriate
sphere of sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we have garnered sufficient evidence to substantiate the claims of this
extraordinary <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. It may also be mentioned that sometimes
this realization of the <em>arahant</em> is summed up in a sentence like</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā
upasampajja viharati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn596-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn596">26</a></sup></p>
<p>having realized by himself through higher knowledge here and now the
influx-free deliverance of the mind and deliverance through wisdom, he dwells
having attained to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another significant discourse in the section of the Fours in the
<em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> which throws some light on how one should look upon the
<em>arahant</em> when he is in <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. The discourse deals with four
types of persons, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>anusotagāmī puggalo,</em> “downstream bound person”</li>
<li><em>paṭisotagāmī puggalo,</em> “upstream bound person”</li>
<li><em>ṭhitatto puggalo,</em> “stationary person”</li>
<li><em>tiṇṇo pāragato thale tiṭṭhati brāhmaṇo,</em> “the Brahmin standing on dry ground
having crossed over and gone beyond”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn597-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn597">27</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The first type of person indulges in sense pleasures and commits evil deeds and
is thus bound downstream in <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>The second type of person refrains from indulgence in sense pleasures and from
evil deeds. His upstream struggle is well expressed in the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sahāpi dukkhena sahāpi domanassena assumukhopi rudamāno paripuṇṇaṁ
parisuddhaṁ brahmacariyaṁ carati,</em></p>
<p>even with pain, even with displeasure, with tearful face and crying he leads
the holy life in its fullness and perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third type, the stationary, is the non-returner who, after death, goes to
the Brahma world and puts and end to suffering there, without coming back to
this world.</p>
<p>It is the fourth type of person who is said to have crossed over and gone to the
farther shore, <em>tiṇṇo pāragato</em>, and stands there, <em>thale tiṭṭhati</em>.</p>
<p>The word <em>brahmin</em> is used here as an epithet of an <em>arahant</em>. This riddle-like
reference to an <em>arahant</em> is explained there with the help of the more thematic
description</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>āsavānaṁ khayā anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ
abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati</em>,</p>
<p>with the extinction of influxes he attains to and abides in the influx free
deliverance of the mind and deliverance through wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to an extremely deep point in our discussion on Nibbāna. If the
<em>arahant</em> in <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> is supposed to be standing on the farther
shore, having gone beyond, what is the position with him when he is taking his
meals or preaching in his every day life? Does he now and then come back to this
side?</p>
<p>Whether the <em>arahant</em>, having gone to the farther shore, comes back at all is a
matter of dispute. The fact that it involves some deeper issues is revealed by
some discourses touching on this question.</p>
<p>The last verse of the <em>Paramaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, for instance,
makes the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na kappayanti na purekkharonti,</em> <br />
<em>dhammā pi tesaṁ na paṭicchitāse,</em> <br />
<em>na brāhmaṇo sīlavatena neyyo,</em> <br />
<em>pāraṁgato na pacceti tādi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn598-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn598">28</a></sup></p>
<p>They, the <em>arahants</em>, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> do not formulate or put forward views, <br />
They do not subscribe to any views, <br />
The true Brahmin is not liable to be led astray <br />
<span class="vin"></span> by ceremonial rites and ascetic vows, <br />
The Such like One, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> who has gone to the farther shore, comes not back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the last line that concerns us here. For the <em>arahant</em> it uses the term
<em>tādī</em>, a highly significant term which we came across earlier too. The rather
literal rendering ‘such-like’ stands for steadfastness, for the unwavering
firmness to stand one’s ground.</p>
<p>So, the implication is that the <em>arahant</em>, once gone beyond, does not come back.
The steadfastness associated with the epithet <em>tādī</em> is reinforced in one
<em>Dhammapada</em> verse by bringing in the simile of the firm post at the city gate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Indakhīlūpamo tādi subbato</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn599-1"><a href="sermon-17.html#fn-fn599">29</a></sup></p>
<p>who is steadfast and well conducted like the pillar at the city gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse in question, then, points to the conclusion that the steadfast one,
the <em>arahant</em>, who has attained supramundane freedom, does not come back.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the eighteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>We happened to mention, in our last sermon, that many of the discourses dealing
with the subject of Nibbāna, have been misinterpreted, due to a lack of
appreciation of the fact that the transcendence of the world and crossing over
to the farther shore of existence have to be understood in a psychological
sense.</p>
<p>The view that the <em>arahant</em> at the end of his life enters into an absolutely
existing <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, or ‘unprepared element’, seems to have received
acceptance in the commentarial period. In the course of our last sermon, we made
it very clear that some of the discourses cited by the commentators in support
of that view deal, on the contrary, with some kind of realization the <em>arahant</em>
goes through here and now, in this very life, in this very world – a realization
of the cessation of existence, or the cessation of the six sense-spheres.</p>
<p>Even when the Buddha refers to the <em>arahant</em> as the Brahmin who, having gone
beyond, is standing on the farther shore,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn601-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn601">2</a></sup> he was speaking of the
<em>arahant</em> who has realized, in this very life, the influx-free deliverance of
the mind and deliverance through wisdom, in his concentration of the fruit of
<em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the strength of this evidence, we are compelled to elicit a
subtler meaning of the concept of ‘this shore’ and the ‘farther shore’ from
these discourses dealing with Nibbāna than is generally accepted in the world.
Our sermon today is especially addressed to that end.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, if one is keen on getting a solution to the problems
relating to Nibbāna, the discourses we are now taking up for discussion might
reveal the deeper dimensions of that problem.</p>
<p>We had to wind up our last sermon while drawing out the implications of the last
line in the <em>Paramaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>: <em>pāraṁgato na pacceti
tādi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn602-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn602">3</a></sup> We drew the inference that the steadfast one, the arahant, who is
such-like, once gone to the farther shore, does not come back.</p>
<p>We find, however, quite a different idea expressed in a verse of the
<em>Nālakasutta</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. The verse, which was the subject of much
controversy among the ancients, runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uccāvāca hi paṭipadā,</em> <br />
<em>samaṇena pakāsitā,</em> <br />
<em>na pāraṁ diguṇaṁ yanti,</em> <br />
<em>na idaṁ ekaguṇaṁ mutaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn603-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn603">4</a></sup></p>
<p>High and low are the paths, <br />
Made known by the recluse, <br />
They go not twice to the farther shore, <br />
Nor yet is it to be reckoned a going once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two lines seem to contradict each other. There is no going twice to the
farther shore, but still it is not to be conceived as a going once.</p>
<p>Now, as for the first two lines, the high and low paths refer to the modes of
practice adopted, according to the grades of understanding in different
character types.</p>
<p>For instances, the highest grade of persons attains Nibbāna by an easy path,
being quick-witted, <em>sukhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā</em>, whereas the lowest grade
attains it by a difficult path, being relatively dull-witted, <em>dukkhā paṭipadā
dandhābhiññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn604-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn604">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The problem lies in the last two lines. The commentary tries to tackle it by
interpreting the reference to not going twice to the farther shore, <em>na pāraṁ
diguṇaṁ yanti</em>, as an assertion that there is no possibility of attaining
Nibbāna by the same path twice, <em>ekamaggena dvikkhattuṁ nibbānaṁ na
yanti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn605-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn605">6</a></sup> The implication is that the supramundane path of a
stream-winner, a once-returner or a non-returner arises only once. Why it is not
to be conceived as a going once is explained as an acceptance of the norm that
requires not less than four supramundane paths to attain <em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>However, a deeper analysis of the verse in question would reveal the fact that
it effectively brings up an apparent contradiction. The commentary sidetracks by
resolving it into two different problems. The two lines simply reflect two
aspects of the same problem.</p>
<p>They go not twice to the farther shore, and this not going twice, <em>na idaṁ</em>, is
however not to be thought of as a ‘going once’ either. The commentary sidetracks
by taking <em>idaṁ</em>, ‘this’, to mean the farther shore, <em>pāraṁ</em>, whereas it
comprehends the whole idea of not going twice. Only then is the paradox
complete.</p>
<p>In other words, this verse concerns the such-like one, the <em>arahant</em>, and not
the stream-winner, the once-returner or the non-returner. Here we have an echo
of the idea already expressed as the grand finale of the <em>Paramaṭṭhakasutta</em>:
<em>pāraṁgato na pacceti tādi</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn606-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn606">7</a></sup> the such-like one, “gone to the farther
shore, comes not back”.</p>
<p>It is the last line, however, that remains a puzzle. Why is this ‘not going
twice,’ not to be thought of as a ‘going once’? There must be something deep
behind this riddle.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, when one says ‘I won’t go there twice’, it means that he will
go only once. When one says ‘I won’t tell twice’, it follows that he will tell
only once. But here we are told that the <em>arahant</em> goes not twice, and yet it is
not a going once.</p>
<p>The idea behind this riddle is that the influx-free <em>arahant</em>, the
such-like-one, gone to the farther shore, which is supramundane, does not come
back to the mundane. Nevertheless, he apparently comes back to the world and is
seen to experience likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains, through the objects
of the five senses. From the point of view of the worldling, the <em>arahant</em> has
come back to the world. This is the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>Why is it not to be conceived of as a going once? Because the <em>arahant</em> has the
ability to detach himself from the world from time to time and re-attain to that
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>It is true that he too experiences the objects of the five external senses, but
now and then he brings his mind to dwell in that <em>arahattaphalasamādhi,</em> which
is like standing on the farther shore.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have an extremely subtle problem. When the <em>arahant</em> comes back
to the world and is seen experiencing the objects of the five senses, one might
of course conclude that he is actually ‘in the world’.</p>
<p>This problematic situation, namely the question how the influx-free <em>arahant</em>,
gone to the farther shore, comes back and takes in objects through the senses,
the Buddha resolves with the help of a simple simile, drawn from nature. For
instance, we read in the <em>Jarāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> the following
scintillating lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Udabindu yathā pi pokkhare,</em> <br />
<em>padume vāri yathā na lippati,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ muni nopalippati,</em> <br />
<em>yadidaṁ diṭṭhasutammutesu vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn607-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn607">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, <br />
Or water that taints not the lotus petal, <br />
So the sage unattached remains, <br />
In regard to what is seen, heard and sensed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the extremely deep problem concerning the relation between the supramundane
and the mundane levels of experience, is resolved by the Buddha by bringing in
the simile of the lotus petal and the lotus leaf.</p>
<p>Let us take up another instance from the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yehi vivitto vicareyya loke,</em> <br />
<em>na tāni uggayha vadeyya nāgo,</em> <br />
<em>elambujaṁ kaṇṭakaṁ vārijaṁ yathā,</em> <br />
<em>jalena paṁkena anūpalittaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ munī santivādo agiddho,</em> <br />
<em>kāme ca loke ca anūpalitto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn608-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn608">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Detached from whatever views, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> the <em>arahant</em> wanders in the world, <br />
He would not converse, taking his stand on them, <br />
Even as the white lotus, sprung up in the water, <br />
Yet remains unsmeared by water and mud, <br />
So is the sage, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> professing peace and free from greed, <br />
Unsmeared by pleasures of sense <br />
<span class="vin"></span> and things of the world.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the Tens of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> we come across a discourse in which the
Buddha answers a question put by Venerable Bāhuna. At that time the Buddha was
staying near the pond Gaggara in the city of Campa. Venerable Bāhuna’s question
was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katīhi nu kho, bhante, dhammehi tathāgato nissaṭo visaṁyutto vippamutto
vimariyādikatena cetasā viharati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn609-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn609">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Detached, disengaged and released from how many things does the Tathāgata
dwell with an unrestricted mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s answer to the question embodies a simile, aptly taken from the
pond, as it were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dasahi kho, Bāhuna, dhammehi tathāgato nissaṭo visaṁyutto vippamutto
vimariyādikatena cetasā viharati. Katamehi dasahi? Rūpena kho, Bāhuna,
Tathāgato nissaṭo visaṁyutto vippamutto vimariyādikatena cetasā viharati,
vedanāya … saññāya … saṅkhārehi … viññāṇena … jātiyā … jarāya
… maraṇena … dukkhehi … kilesehi kho, Bāhuna, Tathāgato nissaṭo
visaṁyutto vippamutto vimariyādikatena cetasā viharati.</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, Bāhuna, uppalaṁ vā padumaṁ vā puṇḍarīkaṁ vā udake jātaṁ udake
saṁvaḍḍhaṁ udakā accugamma tiṭṭhati anupalittaṁ udakena, evam eva kho Bāhuna
Tathāgato imehi dasahi dhammehi nissaṭo visaṁyutto vippamutto vimariyādikatena
cetasā viharati</em>.</p>
<p>Detached, disengaged and released from ten things, Bāhuna, does the Tathāgata
dwell with a mind unrestricted. Which ten? Detached, disengaged and released
from form, Bāhuna, does the Tathāgata dwell with a mind unrestricted;
detached, disengaged and released from feeling … from perceptions … from
preparations … from consciousness … from birth … from decay … from
death … from pains … from defilements, Bāhuna, does the Tathāgata dwell
with a mind unrestricted.</p>
<p>Just as, Bāhuna, a blue lotus, a red lotus, or a white lotus, born in the
water, grown up in the water, rises well above the water and remains unsmeared
by water, even so, Bāhuna, does the Tathāgata dwell detached, disengaged and
released from these ten things with a mind unrestricted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discourse, in particular, highlights the transcendence of the Tathāgata,
though he seems to take in worldly objects through the senses. Even the release
from the five aggregates is affirmed.</p>
<p>We might wonder why the Tathāgata is said to be free from birth, decay and
death, since, as we know, he did grow old and pass away. Birth, decay and death,
in this context, do not refer to some future state either. Here and now the
Tathāgata is free from the concepts of birth, decay and death.</p>
<p>In the course of our discussion of the term <em>papañca</em>, we had occasion to
illustrate how one can be free from such concepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn610-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn610">11</a></sup> If concepts of birth,
decay and death drive fear into the minds of worldlings, such is not the case
with the Tathāgata. He is free from such fears and forebodings. He is free from
defilements as well.</p>
<p>The discourse seems to affirm that the Tathāgata dwells detached from all these
ten things. It seems, therefore, that the functioning of the Tathāgata’s
sense-faculties in his every day life also should follow a certain extraordinary
pattern of detachment and disengagement. In fact, Venerable Sāriputta says
something to that effect in the <em>Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Passati Bhagavā cakkhunā rūpaṁ, chandarāgo Bhagavato natthi, suvimuttacitto
Bhagavā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn611-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn611">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The Exalted One sees forms with the eye, but there is no desire or attachment
in him, well freed in mind is the Exalted One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a similar statement made by the brahmin youth Uttara in the
<em>Brahmāyusutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, after he had closely followed the
Buddha for a considerable period to verify the good report of his extraordinary
qualities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rasapaṭisaṁvedī kho pana so bhavaṁ Gotamo āhāraṁ āhāreti, no
rasarāgapaṭisaṁvedī</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn612-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn612">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Experiencing taste Master Gotama takes his food, but not experiencing any
attachment to the taste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is indeed something marvellous. The implication is that there is such a
degree of detachment with regard to things experienced by the tongue, even when
the senses are taking in their objects. One can understand the difference
between the mundane and the supramundane, when one reflects on the difference
between experiencing taste and experiencing an attachment to taste.</p>
<p>Not only with regard to the objects of the five senses, but even with regard to
mind-objects, the emancipated one has a certain degree of detachment. The
<em>arahant</em> has realized that they are not ‘such’. He takes in concepts, and even
speaks in terms of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, but knows that they are false concepts, as in
the case of a child’s language.</p>
<p>There is a discourse among the Nines of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> which seems to
assert this fact. It is a discourse preached by Venerable Sāriputta to refute a
wrong viewpoint taken by a monk named Chandikāputta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ sammā vimuttacittassa kho, āvuso, bhikkhuno bhusā cepi cakkhuviññeyyā
rūpā cakkhussa āpāthaṁ āgacchanti, nevassa cittaṁ pariyādiyanti,
amissīkatamevassa cittaṁ hoti ṭhitaṁ āneñjappattaṁ, vayaṁ cassānupassati</em>.
<em>Bhusā cepi sotaviññeyyā saddā … bhūsa cepi ghānaviññeyyā gandhā … bhūsa
cepi jivhāviññeyyā rasā … bhūsa cepi kāyaviññeyyā phoṭṭhabbā … bhūsa cepi
manoviññeyyā dhammā manassa āpāthaṁ āgacchanti, nevassa cittaṁ pariyādiyanti,
amissīkatamevassa cittaṁ hoti ṭhitaṁ āneñjappattaṁ, vayaṁ
cassānupassati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn613-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn613">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend, in the case of a monk who is fully released, even if many forms
cognizable by the eye come within the range of vision, they do not overwhelm
his mind, his mind remains unalloyed, steady and unmoved, he sees its passing
away. Even if many sounds cognizable by the ear come within the range of
hearing … even if many smells cognizable by the nose … even if many tastes
cognizable by the tongue … even if many tangibles cognizable by the body …
even if many mind-objects cognizable by the mind come within the range of the
mind, they do not overwhelm his mind, his mind remains unalloyed, steady and
unmoved, he sees its passing away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we have the ideal of the emancipated mind. Generally, a person
unfamiliar with the nature of a lotus leaf or a lotus petal, on seeing a drop of
water on a lotus leaf or a lotus petal would think that the water drop smears
them.</p>
<p>Earlier we happened to mention that there is a wide gap between the mundane and
the supramundane. Some might think that this refers to a gap in time or in
space. In fact it is such a conception that often led to various
misinterpretations concerning Nibbāna. The supramundane seems so far away from
the mundane, so it must be something attainable after death in point of time. Or
else it should be far far away in outer space. Such is the impression made in
general.</p>
<p>But if we go by the simile of the drop of water on the lotus leaf, the distance
between the mundane and the supramundane is the same as that between the lotus
leaf and the drop of water on it.</p>
<p>We are still on the problem of the hither shore and the farther shore. The
distinction between the mundane and the supramundane brings us to the question
of this shore and the other shore.</p>
<p>The <em>arahant’s</em> conception of this shore and the other shore differs from that
of the worldling in general. If, for instance, a native of this island goes
abroad and settles down there, he might even think of a return to his country as
a ‘going abroad’. Similarly, as far as the emancipated sage is concerned, if he,
having gone to the farther shore, does not come back, one might expect him to
think of this world as the farther shore.</p>
<p>But it seems the <em>arahant</em> has no such distinction. A certain <em>Dhammapada</em> verse
alludes to the fact that he has transcended this dichotomy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,</em> <br />
<em>pārāpāraṁ na vijjati,</em> <br />
<em>vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tam ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn614-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn614">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a verse we have quoted earlier too, in connection with the question of
the verbal dichotomy.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn615-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn615">16</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā, pārāpāraṁ na vijjati,</em></p>
<p>to whom there is neither a farther shore, nor a hither shore, nor both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, he has no discrimination between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ, tam ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>who is free from pangs of sorrow and entanglements, him I call a Brahmin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the <em>arahant</em> is free from the verbal dichotomy, which is of
relevance to the worldling. Once gone beyond, the emancipated one has no more
use of these concepts. This is where the Buddha’s dictum in the raft simile of
the <em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em> becomes meaningful.</p>
<p>Even the concepts of a ‘this shore’ and a ‘farther shore’ are useful only for
the purpose of crossing over. If, for instance, the <em>arahant</em>, having gone
beyond, were to think ‘ah, this is my land’, that would be some sort of a
grasping. Then there will be an identification, <em>tammayatā</em>, not a
non-identification, <em>atammayatā</em>.</p>
<p>As we had mentioned earlier, there is a strange quality called <em>atammayatā</em>,
associated with an <em>arahant</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn616-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn616">17</a></sup> In connection with the simile of a man who
picked up a gem, we have already stated the ordinary norm that prevails in the
world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn617-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn617">18</a></sup></p>
<p>If we possess something – we are possessed by it.</p>
<p>If we grasp something – we are caught by it.</p>
<p>This is the moral behind the parable of the gem. It is this conviction, which
prompts the <em>arahant</em> not to grasp even the farther shore, though he may stand
there. ‘This shore’ and the ‘other shore’ are concepts, which have a practical
value to those who are still on this side.</p>
<p>As it is stated in the <em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em>, since there is no boat or bridge to
cross over, one has to improvise a raft by putting together grass, twigs,
branches and leaves, found on this shore. But after crossing over with its help,
he does not carry it with him on his shoulder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evameva kho, bhikkhave, kullūpamo mayā dhammo desito nittharaṇatthāya no
gahaṇatthāya. Kullūpamaṁ vo bhikkhave ājānantehi dhammā pi vo pahātabbā,
pag’eva adhammā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn618-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn618">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Even so, monks, have I preached to you a Dhamma that is comparable to a raft,
which is for crossing over and not for grasping. Well knowing the Dhamma to be
comparable to a raft, you should abandon even the good things, more so the bad
things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might think that the <em>arahant</em> is in the sensuous realm, when, for instance,
he partakes of food. But that is not so. Though he attains to the realms of form
and formless realms, he does not belong there. He has the ability to attain to
those levels of concentration, but he does not grasp them egoistically, true to
that norm of <em>atammayatā</em>, or non-identification.</p>
<p>This indeed is something extraordinary. Views and opinions about language,
dogmatically entertained by the worldlings, lose their attraction for him.</p>
<p>This fact is clearly illustrated for us by the <em>Uragasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta
Nipāta</em>, the significance of which we have already stressed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn619-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn619">20</a></sup> We happened
to mention that there is a refrain, running through all the seventeen verses
making up that discourse. The refrain concerns the worn out skin of a snake. The
last two lines in each verse, forming the refrain, are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṁ purāṇaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn620-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn620">21</a></sup></p>
<p>That monk forsakes the hither and the thither, <br />
Even as the snake its skin that doth wither.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>orapāraṁ</em> is highly significant in this context. <em>Oraṁ</em> means ‘this
shore’ and <em>paraṁ</em> is the ‘farther shore’. The monk, it seems, gives up not only
this shore, but the other shore as well, even as the snake sloughs off its worn
out skin. That skin has served its purpose, but now it is redundant. So it is
sloughed off.</p>
<p>Let us now take up one more verse from the <em>Uragasutta</em> which has the same
refrain, because of its relevance to the understanding of the term <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>The transcendence of relativity involves freedom from the duality in worldly
concepts such as ‘good’ and ‘evil’. The concept of a ‘farther shore’ stands
relative to the concept of a ‘hither shore’. The point of these discourses is to
indicate that there is a freedom from worldly conceptual proliferations based on
duality and relativity. The verse we propose to bring up is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo nāccasārī na paccasārī,</em> <br />
<em>sabbaṁ accagamā imaṁ papañcaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>so bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṁ purāṇaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn621-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn621">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Who neither overreaches himself nor lags behind, <br />
And has gone beyond all this proliferation, <br />
That monk forsakes the hither and the thither, <br />
Even as the snake its slough that doth wither.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse is particularly significant in that it brings out some points of
interest. The overreaching and lagging behind is an allusion to the verbal
dichotomy. In the context of views, for instance, annihilationism is an
overreaching and eternalism is a lagging behind.</p>
<p>We may give another illustration, easier to understand. Speculation about the
future is an overreaching and repentance over the past is a lagging behind. To
transcend both these tendencies is to get beyond proliferation, <em>sabbaṁ accagamā
imaṁ papañcaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>When a banknote is invalidated, cravings, conceits and views bound with it go
down. Concepts current in the world, like banknotes in transaction, are reckoned
as valid so long as cravings, conceits and views bound with them are there. They
are no longer valid when these are gone.</p>
<p>We have defined <em>papañca</em> with reference to cravings, conceits and
views.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn622-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn622">23</a></sup> Commentaries also speak of <em>taṇhāpapañca, diṭṭhipapañca</em> and
<em>mānapapañca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn623-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn623">24</a></sup> By doing away with cravings, conceits and views, one goes
beyond all <em>papañca</em>.</p>
<p>The term <em>orapāraṁ</em>, too, has many connotations. It stands for the duality
implicit in such usages as the ‘internal’ and the ‘external’, ‘one’s own’ and
‘another’s’, as well as ‘this shore’ and the ‘farther shore’. It is compared
here to the worn out skin of a snake. It is worn out by transcending the duality
characteristic of linguistic usage through wisdom.</p>
<p>Why the Buddha first hesitated to teach this Dhamma was the difficulty of making
the world understand.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn624-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn624">25</a></sup> Perhaps it was the conviction that the world could
easily be misled by those limitations in the linguistic medium.</p>
<p>We make these few observations in order to draw attention to the relativity
underlying such terms as ‘this shore’ and the ‘other shore’ and to show how
Nibbāna transcends even that dichotomy.</p>
<p>In this connection, we may take up for comment a highly controversial sutta in
the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, which deals with the two aspects of Nibbāna known as
<em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> and <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>. We propose to quote
the entire sutta, so as to give a fuller treatment to the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vuttaṁ hetaṁ Bhagavatā, vuttam arahatā ti me suttaṁ:</em></p>
<p><em>Dve-mā, bhikkhave, nibbānadhātuyo. Katame dve? Sa-upadisesā ca nibbānadhātu,

<p>This was said by the Exalted One, said by the Worthy One, so have I heard:</p>
<p>’Monks, there are these two Nibbāna elements. Which two? The Nibbāna element
with residual clinging and the Nibbāna element without residual clinging.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element with residual clinging? Herein, monks,
a monk is an <em>arahant</em>, with influxes extinct, one who has lived the holy life
to the full, done what is to be done, laid down the burden, reached one’s
goal, fully destroyed the fetters of existence and released with full
understanding. His five sense faculties still remain and due to the fact that
they are not destroyed, he experiences likes and dislikes, and pleasures and
pains. That extirpation of lust, hate and delusion in him, that, monks, is
known as the Nibbāna element with residual clinging.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residual clinging? Herein,
monks, a monk is an <em>arahant</em>, with influxes extinct, one who has lived the
holy life to the full, done what is to be done, laid down the burden, reached
one’s goal, fully destroyed the fetters of existence and released with full
understanding. In him, here itself, all what is felt will cool off, not being
delighted in. This, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residual clinging.’</p>
<p>To this effect the Exalted One spoke and this is the gist handed down as ‘thus
said’.</p>
<p>’These two Nibbāna elements have been made known, <br />
By the one with vision, unattached and such, <br />
Of relevance to the here and now is one element, <br />
With residual clinging, yet with tentacles to becoming snapped, <br />
But then that element <br />
<span class="vin"></span> without residual clinging is of relevance to the hereafter, <br />
For in it surcease all forms of becoming.</p>
<p>They that comprehend fully this state of the unprepared, <br />
Released in mind with tentacles to becoming snapped, <br />
On winning to the essence of Dhamma <br />
<span class="vin"></span> they take delight in seeing to an end of it all, <br />
So give up they, all forms of becoming,<br />
<span class="vin"></span> steadfastly such-like as they are.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The standard phrase summing up the qualification of an <em>arahant</em> occurs in full
in the definition of the <em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>. The distinctive feature of
this Nibbāna element is brought out in the statement that the <em>arahant’s</em> five
sense faculties are still intact, owing to which he experiences likes and
dislikes, and pleasure and pain. However, to the extent that lust, hate and
delusion are extinct in him, it is called the Nibbāna element with residual
clinging.</p>
<p>In the definition of the Nibbāna element without residual clinging, the same
standard phrase recurs, while its distinctive feature is summed up in just one
sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassa idheva sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni sītibhavissanti</em>,</p>
<p>in him, here itself, all what is felt will cool off, not being delighted in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be noted that the verb is in the future tense and apart from this cooling
off, there is no guarantee of a world beyond, as an <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, or
‘unprepared element’, with no sun, moon or stars in it.</p>
<p>The two verses that follow purport to give a summary of the prose passage. Here
it is clearly stated that out of the two Nibbāna elements, as they are called,
the former pertains to the here and now, <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em>, while the latter
refers to what comes after death, <em>samparāyika</em>.</p>
<p>The Nibbāna element with residual clinging, <em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>, has as
its redeeming feature the assurance that the tentacular craving for becoming is
cut off, despite its exposure to likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains, common
to the field of the five senses.</p>
<p>As for the Nibbāna element without residual clinging, it is definitely stated
that in it all forms of existence come to cease. The reason for it is none other
than the crucial fact, stated in that single sentence, namely, the cooling off
of all what is felt as an inevitable consequence of not being delighted in,
<em>anabhinanditāni</em>.</p>
<p>Why do they not take delight in what is felt at the moment of passing away? They
take delight in something else, and that is: the very destruction of all what is
felt, a foretaste of which they have already experienced in their attainment to
that unshakeable deliverance of the mind, which is the very pith and essence of
the Dhamma, <em>dhammasāra</em>.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>Mahāsāropamasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, the pith of the
Dhamma is that deliverance of the mind,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn626-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn626">27</a></sup> and to take delight in the
ending of all feelings, <em>khaye ratā</em>, is to revert to the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>
with which the <em>arahant</em> is already familiar. That is how those such-like ones
abandon all forms of existence, <em>pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now try to sort out the problems that are likely to be raised in
connection with the interpretation we have given. First and foremost, the two
terms <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em> have to be explained.</p>
<p>A lot of confusion has arisen, due to a misunderstanding of the meaning of these
two terms in this particular context. The usual commentarial exegesis on the
term <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> amounts to this: <em>Imasmiṁ attabhāve bhavā
vattamānā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn627-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn627">28</a></sup> “in this very life, that is, in the present”. It seems all
right. But then for <em>samparāyika</em> the commentary has the following comment:
<em>samparāye khandhabhedato parabhāge</em>, “<em>samparāya</em> means after the breaking up
of the aggregates”. The implication is that it refers to the <em>arahant’s</em> after
death state.</p>
<p>Are we then to conclude that the <em>arahant</em> gets half of his Nibbāna here and the
other half hereafter? The terms <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em>, understood
in their ordinary sense, would point to such a conclusion.</p>
<p>But let us not forget that the most distinctive quality of this Dhamma is
associated with the highly significant phrase, <em>diṭṭhevadhamme</em>, “in this very
life”. It is also conveyed by the expression <em>sandiṭṭhika akālika</em>, “here and
now” and “timeless”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn628-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn628">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The goal of endeavour, indicated by this Dhamma, is one that could be fully
realized here and now, in this very life. It is not a piecemeal affair. Granting
all that, do we find here something contrary to it, conveyed by the two terms
<em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em>? How can we reconcile these two passages?</p>
<p>In the context of <em>kamma</em>, the meaning of the two terms in question can easily
be understood.</p>
<p>For instance, that category of <em>kamma</em> known as <em>diṭṭhadhammavedanīya</em> refers to
those actions which produce their results here and now.</p>
<p><em>Samparāyika</em> pertains to what comes after death, as for instance in the phrase
<em>samparāye ca duggati</em>, an “evil bourn after death”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn629-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn629">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In the context of <em>kamma</em> it is clear enough, then, that the two terms refer to
what is experienced in this world and what comes after death, respectively.</p>
<p>Are we justified in applying the same criterion, when it comes to the so-called
two elements of Nibbāna? Do the <em>arahants</em> experience some part of Nibbāna here
and the rest hereafter?</p>
<p>At this point, we have to admit that the term <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> is associated
with <em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> while the term <em>samparāyika</em> is taken over to
refer to <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>.</p>
<p>However, the fact that Nibbāna is explicitly defined elsewhere as the cessation
of existence, <em>bhavanirodho Nibbānaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn630-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn630">31</a></sup> must not be forgotten. If Nibbāna
is the cessation of existence, there is nothing left for the <em>arahant</em> to
experience hereafter.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is solely the realization of the cessation of existence or the end of
the process of becoming. So there is absolutely no question of a hereafter for
the <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>By way of clarification, we have to revert to the primary sense of the term
Nibbāna. We have made it sufficiently clear that Nibbāna means ‘extinction’ or
‘extinguishment’, as of a fire.</p>
<p>All the commentarial jargon, equating <em>vāna</em> to <em>taṇhā</em>, is utterly irrelevant.
If the idea of an extinguishment of a fire is brought in, the whole problem is
solved. Think of a blazing fire. If no more firewood is added to it, the flames
would subside and the embers would go on smouldering before turning into ashes.
This is the norm. Now this is not an analogy we are superimposing on the Dhamma.
It is only an echo of a canonical simile, picked up from the <em>Nāgasutta</em> of the
<em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>. The relevant verse, we are quoting, recurs in the <em>Udāyi
Theragāthā</em> as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mahāgini pajjalito,</em> <br />
<em>anāhārūpasammati,</em> <br />
<em>aṅgāresu ca santesu,</em> <br />
<em>nibbuto’ti pavuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn631-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn631">32</a></sup></p>
<p>As a huge blazing fire, with no more firewood added, <br />
Goes down to reach a state of calm, <br />
Embers smouldering, as they are, could be reckoned, <br />
So long as they last, as almost ‘extinguished’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we opted to render the verse this way, there is a variant reading, which
could lead to a different interpretation. As so often happens in the case of
deep suttas, here too the correct reading is not easily determined.</p>
<p>Instead of the phrase <em>aṅgāresu ca santesu</em>, attested as it is, many editions go
for the variant reading <em>saṅkhāresūpasantesu</em>. If that reading is adopted, the
verse would have to be rendered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a huge blazing fire, with no more fire wood added, <br />
Goes down to reach a state of calm, <br />
When <em>saṅkhāras</em> calm down, <br />
One is called ‘extinguished’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It maybe pointed out that this variant reading does not accord with the imagery
of the fire presented by the first two lines of the verse. It is probably a
scribe’s error that has come down, due to the rhythmic similarity between the
two phrases <em>aṅgāresu ca santesu</em>, and <em>saṅkhāresūpasantesu</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn632-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn632">33</a></sup> Between
the reciter and the scribe, phrases that have a similar ring and rhythm, could
sometimes bring about a textual corruption. Be that as it may, we have opted for
the reading <em>aṅgāresu ca santesu</em>, because it makes more sense.</p>
<p>From the particular context in which the verse occurs, it seems that this
imagery of the fire is a restatement of the image of the lotus unsmeared by
water. Though the embers are still smouldering, to the extent that they are no
longer hungering for more fuel and are not emitting flames, they may as well be
reckoned as ‘extinguished’.</p>
<p>We can draw a parallel between this statement and the definition of
<em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> already quoted. As a full-fledged <em>arahant</em>, he
still experiences likes and dislikes and pleasures and pains, owing to the fact
that his five sense-faculties are intact.</p>
<p>The assertion made by the phrase beginning with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tassa tiṭṭhanteva pañcindriyāni yesaṁ avighātattā …</em>,</p>
<p>his five senses do exist, owing to the non-destruction of which …,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>rather apologetically brings out the limitations of the living <em>arahant</em>. It is
reminiscent of those smouldering embers in the imagery of the <em>Nāgasutta</em>.
However, in so far as flames of lust, hate and delusion are quenched in him, it
comes to be called <em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>, even as in the case of those
smouldering embers.</p>
<p>Craving is aptly called <em>bhavanetti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn633-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn633">34</a></sup> in the sense that it leads to
becoming by catching hold of more and more fuel in the form of <em>upādāna</em>. When
it is under control, the functioning of the sense-faculties do not entail
further rebirth. The inevitable residual clinging in the living <em>arahant</em> does
not precipitate a fresh existence.</p>
<p>This gives us a clue to the understanding of the term <em>anupādisesa</em>. The element
<em>upādi</em> in this term is rather ambiguous.</p>
<p>In the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, for instance, it is used as the criterion to distinguish the <em>anāgāmi</em>, the ‘non-returner’, from the <em>arahant</em>, in the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭhevadhamme aññā, sati vā upādisese anāgāmitā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn634-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn634">35</a></sup></p>
<p>either full convincing knowledge of <em>arahanthood</em> here and now, or the state
of non-return in the case of residual clinging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when it comes to the distinction between <em>sa-upādisesa</em> and <em>anupādisesa</em>,
the element <em>upādi</em> has to be understood in a more radical sense, in association
with the word <em>upādiṇṇa</em>. This body, as the product of past <em>kamma</em>, is the
‘grasped’ par excellence, which as an organic combination goes on functioning
even in the <em>arahant</em> until his last moment of life.</p>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta once declared that he neither delighted in death nor
delighted in life, <em>nābhinandāmi maraṇaṁ nābhinandāmi jīvitaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn635-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn635">36</a></sup> So the
embers go on smouldering until they become ashes. It is when the life span ends
that the embers finally turn to ashes.</p>
<p>The popular interpretation of the term <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> leaves room for some absolutist conceptions of an <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, unprepared element, as the destiny of the <em>arahant</em>. After his <em>parinibbāna</em>, he is supposed to enter this particular <em>Nibbānadhātu</em>. But here, in this discourse, it is explained in just one sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassa idheva, bhikkhave, sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni sītibhavissanti,</em></p>
<p>in the case of him (that is the <em>arahant</em>), O! monks, all what is felt, not
having been delighted in, will cool off here itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cooling off happens just before death, without igniting another spark of
life. When Māra comes to grab and seize, the <em>arahant</em> lets go. The pain of
death with which Māra teases his hapless victim and lures him into another
existence, becomes ineffective in the case of the <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>As he has already gone through the supramundane experience of deathlessness, in
the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, death loses its sting when at last it comes. The
influx-free deliverance of the mind and the influx-free deliverance through
wisdom enable him to cool down all feelings in a way that baffles Māra.</p>
<p>So the <em>arahant</em> lets go of his body, experiencing ambrosial deathlessness. As
in the case of Venerable Dabba Mallaputta, he would sometimes cremate his own
body without leaving any ashes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn636-1"><a href="sermon-18.html#fn-fn636">37</a></sup> Outwardly it might appear as an act of
self-immolation, which indeed is painful. But this is not so. Using his <em>jhānic</em>
powers, he simply employs the internal fire element to cremate the body he has
already discarded.</p>
<p>This, then, is the Buddha’s extraordinary solution to the problem of overcoming
death, a solution that completely outwits Māra.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the nineteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our last sermon, we started commenting on the two terms
<em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> and <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>. Our discussion was
based on a discourse, which we quoted from the <em>Itivuttaka</em>. We also drew
attention to a certain analogy found in the discourses, which shows that the two
Nibbāna elements actually represent two stages of the extinguishment implicit in
the term Nibbāna.</p>
<p>When no more firewood is added to a blazing fire, flames would subside and the
logs of wood already burning go on smouldering as embers. After some time, they
too get extinguished and become ashes. With regard to the <em>arahant</em>, too, we
have to think in terms of this analogy.</p>
<p>It can be taken as an illustration of the two Nibbāna elements. To the extent
the living <em>arahant</em> is free from fresh graspings, lust, hate and delusions do
not flare up. But so long as he has to bear the burden of this organic
combination, this physical frame, the <em>arahant</em> has to experience certain
afflictions and be receptive to likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, mentally he has access to the experience of the
extinguishment he has already won. It is in that sense that the <em>arahant</em> is
said to be in the Nibbāna element with residual clinging in his everyday life,
while taking in the objects of the five senses.</p>
<p>At the last moment of the <em>arahant’s</em> life, even this organic body that had been
grasped as <em>upādiṇṇa</em> has to be abandoned. It is at that moment, when he is
going to detach his mind from the body, that <em>anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu</em>
comes in. A brief hint to this effect is given in one of the verses occurring in
the <em>Nāgasutta</em> referred to earlier. The verse runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vītarāga vītadoso</em> <br />
<em>vītamoho anāsavo</em> <br />
<em>sarīraṁ vijahaṁ nāgo</em> <br />
<em>parinibbissati anāsavo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn638-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn638">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The one who has abandoned lust, <br />
Hate and delusion and is influx-free, <br />
That elephant of a man, on giving up his body, <br />
Will attain full appeasement, being influx-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we define in brief the two Nibbāna elements this way, a more difficult
problem confronts us relating to the sense in which they are called
<em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em>. <em>Diṭṭhadhammika</em> means what pertains to this
life and <em>samparāyika</em> refers to what comes after death. What is the idea in
designating <em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> as <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>anupādisesā
Nibbānadhātu</em> as <em>samparāyika</em>?</p>
<p>In the context of <em>kamma</em>, the meaning of these two terms is easily understood.
But when it comes to Nibbāna, such an application of the terms would imply two
types of <em>Nibbānic</em> bliss, one to be experienced here and the other hereafter.</p>
<p>But that kind of explanation would not accord with the spirit of this Dhamma,
because the Buddha always emphasizes the fact that Nibbāna is something to be
realized here and now in toto. It is not a piecemeal realization, leaving
something for the hereafter. Such terms like <em>diṭṭheva dhamme</em>, in this very
life, <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, here and now, and <em>akālika</em>, timeless, emphasize this
aspect of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the context of Nibbāna, these two terms have to be understood as representing
two aspects of a perfect realization attainable in this very life. Briefly
stated, <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> is that which confers the certitude, well in
time, that the appeasement experienced by an <em>arahant</em> during this life time
remains unchanged even at death.</p>
<p>To say that there is a possibility of realizing or ascertaining one’s state
after death might even seem contradictory. How can one realize one’s after death
state?</p>
<p>We get a clear-cut answer to that question in the following passage in the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhu, telañca paṭicca vaṭṭiñca paṭicca telappadīpo jhāyati,
tasseva telassa ca vaṭṭiyā ca pariyādānā aññassa ca anupahārā anāhāro
nibbāyati, evameva kho, bhikkhu, kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno
’kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vedayāmī’ti pajānati, jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ
vediyamāno ’jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vedayāmī’ti pajānati, ’kāyassa bhedā
paraṁ maraṇā uddhaṁ jīvitapariyādānā idheva sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni
sītībhavissantī’ti pajānati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn639-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn639">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as, monk, an oil lamp burns depending on oil and the wick, and when that
oil and the wick are used up, if it does not get any more of these, it is
extinguished from lack of fuel, even so, monk, when he feels a feeling limited
to the body, he understands ‘I feel a feeling limited to the body’, when he
feels a feeling limited to life, he understands ‘I feel a feeling limited to
life’, he understands ‘on the breaking up of this body, before life becomes
extinct, even here itself, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will
become cool’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last sentence is particularly noteworthy in that it refers to an
understanding well beforehand that all feelings, not being delighted in, will
become cool at death. The futuristic ending signifies an assurance, here and
now, as the word <em>idheva</em>, even here itself, clearly brings out. The delighting
will not be there, because all craving for a fresh existence is extirpated.</p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> has won this assurance already in his <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, in
which he experiences the cooling off of all feelings. That is why we find the
<em>arahants</em> giving expression to their <em>Nibbānic</em> bliss in the words
<em>sītibhūto’smi nibbuto</em>, “gone cool am I, yea, extinguished”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn640-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn640">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Since for the <em>arahant</em> this cooling off of feelings is a matter of experience
in this very life, this realization is referred to as <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em> in
the discourses. Here we seem to have fallen into another track. We opened our
discussion with an explanation of what <em>anupādisesa parinibbāna</em> is, now we are
on <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em>. How are we to distinguish between these two?</p>
<p><em>Anupādisesa parinibbāna</em> comes at the last moment of the <em>arahant’s</em> life, when
this organic combination of elements, grasped par excellence, <em>upādiṇṇa</em>, is
discarded for good. But <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em> refers to the
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> as such, for which even other terms like <em>anupādā
vimokkha</em> are also applied on occasion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn641-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn641">5</a></sup></p>
<p>As the term <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em> signifies, the <em>arahant</em> experiences, even in
this very life, that complete extinguishment, <em>parinibbāna</em>, in his <em>arahatta
phalasamādhi</em>. This fact is clearly brought out in the dialogue between
Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta in the <em>Rathavinītasutta</em>
of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta’s exhaustive interrogation ending with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>kim atthaṁ carahāvuso, bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn642-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn642">6</a></sup></p>
<p>For the sake of what then, friend, is the holy life lived under the Exalted
One?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gets the following conclusive answer from Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>anupādāparinibbānatthaṁ kho, āvuso, bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati</em>,</p>
<p>Friend, it is for the sake of perfect Nibbāna without grasping that the holy
life is lived under the Exalted One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the goal of endeavour, <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em> surely does not mean the ending
of life. What it implies is the realization of Nibbāna. It is that experience of
the cooling off of feelings the <em>arahant</em> goes through in the
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>It is sometimes also called <em>nirupadhi</em>, the ‘asset-less’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn643-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn643">7</a></sup> Here we have
a problem of a semantic type. At a later date, even the term <em>nirupadhisesa</em>
seems to have come into vogue, which is probably a cognate formed after the term
<em>anupādisesa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn644-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn644">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Nowhere in the discourses one comes across the term <em>nirupadhisesa parinibbāna</em>.
Only such terms as <em>nirupadhi</em>, <em>nirūpadhiṁ,</em> <em>nirupadhi dhammaṁ</em> are met with.
They all refer to that <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, as for instance in the following
verse, which we had occasion to quote earlier too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kāyena amataṁ dhātuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>phusayitvā nirūpadhiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>upadhipaṭinissaggaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sacchikatvā anāsavo,</em> <br />
<em>deseti sammāsambuddho,</em> <br />
<em>asokaṁ virajaṁ padaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn645-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn645">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Having touched with the body, <br />
The deathless element, which is asset-less, <br />
And realized the relinquishment of assets, <br />
Being influx-free, the perfectly enlightened one, <br />
Proclaims the sorrow-less, taintless state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To proclaim, one has to be alive. Therefore <em>nirupadhi</em> is used in the
discourses definitely for the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, which is a living
experience for the <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p><em>Anupādā parinibbāna, anupādā vimokkha</em> and <em>nirupadhi</em> all refer to that
experience of the cooling off of feelings. This fact is clearly revealed by the
following two verses in the <em>Vedanāsaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Samāhito sampajāno,</em> <br />
<em>sato Buddhassa sāvako,</em> <br />
<em>vedanā ca pajānāti,</em> <br />
<em>vedanānañca sambhavaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Yattha cetā nirujjhanti,</em> <br />
<em>maggañca khayagāminaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vedanānaṁ khayā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nicchāto parinibbuto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn646-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn646">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this couplet, the experience of the fruit of <em>arahanthood</em> is presented under
the heading of feeling. The disciple of the Buddha, concentrated, fully aware
and mindful, understands feelings, the origin of feelings, and the point at
which they surcease and the way leading to their extinction.</p>
<p>With the extinction of feelings, that monk is hunger-less and perfectly
extinguished. The reference here is to that bliss of Nibbāna which is devoid of
feeling, <em>avedayita sukha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn647-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn647">11</a></sup> It is hunger-less because it is free from
craving.</p>
<p>The perfect extinguishment mentioned here is not to be understood as the death
of the <em>arahant</em>. In the discourses the term <em>parinibbuta</em> is used as such even
with reference to the living <em>arahant</em>. Only in the commentaries we find a
distinction made in this respect. The <em>parinibbāna</em> of the living <em>arahant</em> is
called <em>kilesaparinibbāna</em>, the perfect extinguishment of the defilements, while
what comes at the last moment of an <em>arahant’s</em> life is called
<em>khandhaparinibbāna</em>, the perfect extinguishment of the groups or
aggregates.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn648-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn648">12</a></sup> Such a qualification, however, is not found in the
discourses.</p>
<p>The reason for this distinction was probably the semantic development the term
<em>parinibbāna</em> had undergone in the course of time. The fact that this perfect
extinguishment is essentially psychological seems to have been ignored with the
passage of time. That is why today, on hearing the word <em>parinibbāna</em>, one is
immediately reminded of the last moment of the life of the Buddha or of an
<em>arahant</em>. In the discourses, however, <em>parinibbāna</em> is clearly an experience of
the living <em>arahant</em> in his <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>This fact is clearly borne out by the statement in the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>
already quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>idheva sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni sītībhavissantī’ti pajānati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn649-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn649">13</a></sup></p>
<p>he understands that all what is felt will cool off here itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this very understanding that is essential. It gives the certitude that one
can defeat Māra at the moment of death through the experience of the cooling off
of feelings.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ</em> refers to the feeling which comes at the
termination of one’s life. For the <em>arahant</em>, the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> stands
in good stead, particularly at the moment of death. That is why it is called
<em>akuppā cetovimutti</em>, the unshakeable deliverance of the mind.</p>
<p>All other deliverances of the mind get shaken before the pain of death, but not
this unshakeable deliverance of the mind, which is the REAL-ization of
extinguishment that is available to the <em>arahant</em> already in the
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, in the experience of the cooling off of feelings. It is
this unshakeable deliverance of the mind that the Buddha and the <em>arahants</em>
resort to at the end of their lives, when Māra comes to grab and seize.</p>
<p>So now we can hark back to that verse which comes as the grand finale in the
long discourse from the <em>Itivuttaka</em> we have already quoted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye etad aññāya padaṁ asaṅkhataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vimuttacittā bhavanettisaṅkhayā,</em> <br />
<em>te dhammasārādhigamā khaye ratā,</em> <br />
<em>pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn650-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn650">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse might appear problematic, as it occurs at the end of a passage
dealing with the two Nibbāna elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye etad aññāya padaṁ asaṅkhataṁ</em>,</p>
<p>those who having fully comprehended this unprepared state,</p>
<p><em>vimuttacittā bhavanettisaṅkhayā</em>,</p>
<p>are released in mind by the cutting off of tentacles to becoming,</p>
<p><em>te dhammasārādhigamā khaye ratā</em>,</p>
<p>taking delight in the extirpation of feelings due to their attainment to the
essence of <em>dhamma</em>,</p>
<p>(that is the unshakeable deliverance of the mind),</p>
<p><em>pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino</em>,</p>
<p>being steadfastly such like, they have given up all forms of becoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last line is an allusion to the experience of the cessation of existence
here and now, which in effect is the realization of Nibbāna, true to the
definition <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em>, “cessation of existence is Nibbāna”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn651-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn651">15</a></sup></p>
<p>It is that very cessation of existence that is called <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, the
‘unprepared element’. If <em>bhava</em>, or existence, is to be called <em>saṅkhata</em>, the
‘prepared’, the cessation of existence has to be designated as <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the
‘unprepared’. Here lies the difference between the two.</p>
<p>So we have here two aspects of the same unprepared element, designated as
<em>sa-upādisesā parinibbānadhātu</em> and <em>anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu</em>. The mind is
free even at the stage of <em>sa-upādisesa</em>, to the extent that the smouldering
embers do not seek fresh fuel.</p>
<p><em>Anupādisesa</em> refers to the final experience of extinguishment. There the
relevance of the term <em>parinibbāna</em> lies in the fact that at the moment of death
the <em>arahants</em> direct their minds to this unshakeable deliverance of the mind.
This is the ‘island’ they resort to when Māra comes to grab.</p>
<p>The best illustration for all this is the way the Buddha faced death, when the
time came for it. Venerable Anuruddha delineates it beautifully in the following
two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāhu assāsapassāso,</em> <br />
<em>ṭhitacittassa tādino,</em> <br />
<em>anejo santimārabbha,</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ kālamakarī muni.</em></p>
<p><em>Asallīnena cittena,</em> <br />
<em>vedanaṁ ajjhavāsayi,</em> <br />
<em>pajjotass’eva nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vimokkho cetaso ahu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn652-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn652">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Adverting to whatever peace, <br />
The urgeless sage reached the end of his life span, <br />
There were no in-breaths and out-breaths, <br />
For that steadfastly such-like one of firm mind.</p>
<p>With a mind fully alert, <br />
He bore up the pain, <br />
The deliverance of the mind was like <br />
The extinguishment of a torch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The allusion here is to the deliverance of the mind. This is a description of
how the Buddha attained <em>parinibbāna</em>. Though there is a great depth in these
two verses, the commentarial exegesis seems to have gone at a tangent at this
point. Commenting on the last two lines of the first verse, the commentary
observes: <em>Buddhamuni santiṁ gamissāmīti, santiṁ ārabbha kālamakari</em>, “the
Buddha, the sage, passed away for the sake of that peace with the idea ‘I will
go to that state of peace’”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn653-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn653">17</a></sup></p>
<p>There is some discrepancy in this explanation. Commentators themselves usually
give quite a different sense to the word <em>ārabbha</em> than the one implicit in this
explanation. Here it means “for the sake of”. It is for the sake of that peace
that the Buddha is said to have passed away.</p>
<p>In such commentaries as <em>Jātaka-aṭṭhakathā</em> and <em>Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā</em>,
commentators do not use the word <em>ārabbha</em> in the introductory episodes in this
sense. There it only means “in connection with”, indicating the origin of the
story, as suggested by the etymological background of the word itself.</p>
<p>When for instance it is said that the Buddha preached a particular sermon in
connection with Devadatta Thera, it does not necessarily mean that it was meant
for him.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn654-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn654">18</a></sup> He may not have been there at all, it may be that he was
already dead by that time. The term <em>ārabbha</em> in such contexts only means that
it was in connection with him. It can refer to a person or an incident, as the
point of origin of a particular sermon.</p>
<p>Granted this, we have to explain the verse in question not as an allusion to the
fact that the Buddha, the sage, passed away for the sake of that peace with the
idea ‘I will attain to that state of peace’. It only means that the Buddha, the
sage, passed away having brought his mind into that state of peace. In other
words, according to the commentary the passing away comes first and the peace
later, but according to the sutta proper, peace comes first and the passing away
later.</p>
<p>There is a crucial point involved in this commentarial divergence. It has the
presumption that the Buddha passed away in order to enter into ‘that Nibbāna
element’. This presumption is evident quite often in the commentaries. When hard
put to it, the commentaries sometimes concede the sutta’s standpoint, but more
often than otherwise they follow a line of interpretation that comes dangerously
close to an eternalist point of view, regarding Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Here too the commentarial exegesis, based on the term <em>ārabbha</em>, runs the same
risk. On the other hand, as we have pointed out, the reference here is to the
fact that the Buddha adverted his mind to that peace well before the onset of
death, whereby Māra’s attempt is foiled, because feelings are already cooled
off. It is here that the unshakeable deliverance of the mind proves its worth.</p>
<p>As a ‘real’-ization it is already available to the Buddha and the <em>arahants</em> in
the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, and when the time comes, they put forward this
experience to beat off Māra. That is why we find a string of epithets for
Nibbāna, such as <em>tāṇaṁ, leṇaṁ, dīpaṁ, saraṇaṁ, parāyanaṁ, khemaṁ</em> and
<em>amataṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn655-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn655">19</a></sup></p>
<p>When faced with death, or the pain of death, it gives ‘protection’<em>, tānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It provides shelter, like a ‘cave’, <em>leṇaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It is the ‘island’, <em>dīpaṁ</em>, within easy reach.</p>
<p>It is the ‘refuge’, <em>saraṇaṁ</em>, and the ‘resort’, <em>parāyanaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It is the ‘security’, <em>khemaṁ</em>, and above all the ‘deathless’, <em>amataṁ</em>.</p>
<p>This deathlessness they experience in this very world, and when death comes,
this realization stands them in good stead.</p>
<p>Why Venerable Anuruddha brought in the profane concept of death with the
expression <em>kālamakari</em> into this verse, describing the Buddha’s <em>parinibbāna</em>,
is also a question that should arrest our attention.</p>
<p>This particular expression is generally used in connection with the death of
ordinary people. Why did he use this expression in such a hallowed context? It
is only to distinguish and demarcate the deliverance of the mind, couched in the
phrase <em>vimokkho cetaso ahu</em>, from the phenomenon of death itself.</p>
<p>The Buddhas and <em>arahants</em> also abandon this body, like other beings. The
expression <em>kālamakari</em>, “made an end of time”, is an allusion to this
phenomenon. In fact, it is only the Buddhas and <em>arahants</em> who truly make an
‘end’ of time, being fully aware of it. Therefore the most important revelation
made in the last two lines of the first verse, <em>anejo santimārabbha, yaṁ
kālamakarī muni</em>, is the fact that the Buddha passed away having brought his
mind to the peace of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>All this goes to prove that an <em>arahant</em>, even here and now in this very life,
has realized his after death state, which is none other than the birthless
cessation of all forms of existence that amounts to deathlessness itself.</p>
<p>In all other religions immortality is something attainable after death. If one
brings down the Buddha’s Dhamma also to that level, by smuggling in the idea of
an everlasting Nibbāna, it too will suffer the same fate. That would contradict
the teachings on impermanence, <em>aniccatā</em>, and insubstantiality, <em>anattatā</em>.</p>
<p>But here we have an entirely different concept. It is a case of overcoming the
critical situation of death by directing one’s mind to a concentration that
nullifies the power of Māra. So it becomes clear that the two terms
<em>sa-upādisesā parinibbānadhātu</em> and <em>anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu</em> stand for two
aspects of the same <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>, or the unprepared element.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, <em>arahants</em> have already directly realized, well in time,
their after death state. That is to say, not only have they gone through the
experience of extinguishment here and now, but they are also assured of the fact
that this extinguishment is irreversible even after death, since all forms of
existence come to cease.</p>
<p>This is an innovation, the importance of which can hardly be overestimated. Here
the Buddha has transcended even the dichotomy between the two terms
<em>sandiṭṭhika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em>. Generally, the world is inclined to believe
that one can be assured only of things pertaining to this life. In fact, the
word <em>sandiṭṭhika</em> literally means that one can be sure only of things visible
here and now. Since one cannot be sure of what comes after death, worldlings are
in the habit of investing faith in a particular teacher or in a god.</p>
<p>To give a clearer picture of the principle involved in this statement, let us
bring up a simple episode, concerning the general Sīha, included among the Fives
of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>. It happens to centre on <em>dānakathā</em>, or talks on
liberality. Let it be a soft interlude – after all these abstruse discourses.</p>
<p>Sīha, the general, is a wealthy benefactor, endowed with deep faith in the
Buddha. One day he approaches the Buddha and asks the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sakkā nu kho, bhante, sandiṭṭhikaṁ dānaphalaṁ paññāpetuṁ?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn656-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn656">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Is it possible, Lord, to point out an advantage or fruit of giving visible
here and now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What prompted the question may have been the usual tendency to associate the
benefits of giving with the hereafter. Now the Buddha, in his answer to the
question, gave four advantages visible here and now and one advantage to come
hereafter. The four fruits of giving visible here and now are stated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>dāyako, sīha, dānapati bahuno janassa piyo hoti manāpo</em>, “Sīha, a benevolent
donor is dear and acceptable to many people”.</li>
<li><em>dāyakaṁ dānapatiṁ santo sappurisā bhajanti</em>, “good men of integrity resort
to that benevolent donor”.</li>
<li><em>dāyakassa dānapatino kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggacchati</em>, “a good report of
fame goes in favour of that benevolent donor”.</li>
<li><em>dāyako dānapati yaṁ yadeva parisaṁ upasaṅkamati, yadi khattiyaparisaṁ yadi
brāhmaṇaparisaṁ yadi gahapatiparisaṁ yadi samaṇaparisaṁ, visārado va
upasaṅkamati amaṅkubhūto</em>, “whatever assembly that benevolent donor
approaches, be it an assembly of kings, or brahmins, or householders, or
recluses, he approaches with self confidence, not crestfallen”.</li>
</ol>
<p>These four fruits or advantages are reckoned as <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, because one can
experience them here and now. In addition to these, the Buddha mentions a fifth,
probably by way of encouragement, though it is outside the scope of the
question.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><em>dāyako, sīha, dānapati kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā sugatiṁ saggaṁ lokaṁ
upapajjati</em>, “the benevolent donor, Sīha, when his body breaks up after death
is reborn in a happy heavenly world.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a fruit of giving that pertains to the next world, <em>samparāyikaṁ
dānaphalaṁ</em>. Then Sīha the general makes a comment, which is directly relevant
to our discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yānimāni, bhante, bhagavatā cattāri sandiṭṭhikāni dānaphalāni akkhātāni,
nāhaṁ ettha bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi, ahaṁ petāni jānāmi. Yañca kho maṁ,
bhante, bhagavā evamāha ’dāyako, sīha, dānapati kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā
sugatiṁ saggaṁ lokaṁ upapajjatī’ti, etāhaṁ na jānāmi, ettha ca panāhaṁ
bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi</em>.</p>
<p>Those four fruits of giving, visible here and now, which the Lord has
preached, as for them, I do not believe out of faith in the Exalted One,
because I myself know them to be so. But that about which the Exalted One
said: ‘Sīha, a benevolent donor, when the body breaks up after death is reborn
in a happy heavenly world’, this I do not know. As to that, however, I believe
out of faith in the Exalted One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the first four advantages of giving, Sīha says “I do not believe out
of faith in the Exalted One, because I myself know them to be so”, <em>nāhaṁ ettha
bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi, ahaṁ petāni jānāmi</em>. It is because he knows out of
his own experience that they are facts that he does not believe out of faith in
the Exalted One. There is something deep, worth reflecting upon, in this
statement.</p>
<p>Then with regard to the fruit of giving, mentioned last, that is to say the one
that concerns the hereafter, <em>samparāyika</em>, Sīha confesses that he does not know
it as a fact, but that he believes it out of faith in the Exalted One, <em>etāhaṁ
na jānāmi, ettha ca panāhaṁ bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi</em>. It is because he does
not know, that he believes out of faith in the Exalted One.</p>
<p>Here then we have a good illustration of the first principle we have outlined
earlier. Where there is knowledge born of personal experience, there is no need
of faith. Faith is displaced by knowledge of realization. It is where one has no
such experiential knowledge that faith comes in. That is why Sīha confesses that
he has faith in the fifth fruit of giving. With regard to the first four, faith
is something redundant for him.</p>
<p>Now that we have clarified for ourselves this first principle, there is a
certain interesting riddle verse in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, to which we may apply it
effectively, not out of a flair for riddles, but because it is relevant to our
topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Assaddho akataññū ca,</em> <br />
<em>sandhicchedo ca yo naro,</em> <br />
<em>hatāvakāso vantāso,</em> <br />
<em>sa ve uttamaporiso.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn657-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn657">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a verse attributed to the Buddha that comes in the <em>Arahantavagga</em> of
the <em>Dhammapada</em>, which puns upon some words. Such riddle verses follow the
pattern of a figure of speech called double entendre, which makes use of
ambiguous words. The above verse sounds blasphemous on the first hearing. The
Buddha is said to have employed this device to arrest the listener’s attention.
The surface meaning seems to go against the Dhamma, but it provokes deeper
reflection.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>assaddho</em> means faithless, to be <em>akataññū</em> is to be ungrateful,
<em>sandhicchedo</em> is a term for a housebreaker, <em>hatāvakāso</em> is a hopeless case
with no opportunities, <em>vantāso</em> means greedy of vomit. So the surface meaning
amounts to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That faithless ungrateful man, <br />
Who is a housebreaker, <br />
Who is hopeless and greedy of vomit, <br />
He indeed is the man supreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the deeper meaning the words have to be construed differently. <em>Assaddho</em>
implies that level of penetration into truth at which faith becomes redundant.
<em>Akata</em>, the unmade, is an epithet for Nibbāna, and <em>akataññū</em> is one who knows
the unmade. <em>Sandhicchedo</em> means one who has cut off the connecting links to
<em>saṁsāra</em>. <em>Hatāvakāso</em> refers to that elimination of opportunities for rebirth.
<em>Vantāso</em> is a term for one who has vomited out desires. The true meaning of the
verse, therefore, can be summed up as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That man who has outgrown faith, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> as he is a knower of the unmade, <br />
Who has sundered all shackles to existence <br />
<span class="vin"></span> and destroyed all possibilities of rebirth, <br />
Who has spewed out all desires, <br />
He indeed is the man supreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description, then, turns out to be that of an <em>arahant</em>. <em>Assaddho</em> as an
epithet for the <em>arahant</em> follows the same norm as the epithet <em>asekho</em>.
<em>Sekha</em>, meaning ‘learner’, is a term applied to those who are training for the
attainment of <em>arahanthood</em>, from the stream-winner, <em>sotāpanna</em>, upwards.</p>
<p>Literally, <em>asekha</em> could be rendered as ‘unlearned’ or ‘untrained’. But it is
certainly not in that sense that an <em>arahant</em> is called <em>asekha</em>. He is called
<em>asekha</em> in the sense that he is no longer in need of that training, that is to
say, he is an adept. <em>Assaddho</em>, too, has to be construed similarly.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned before, the <em>arahant</em> has already realized the cessation of
existence in his <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, thereby securing the knowledge of the
unmade, <em>akata</em>, or the unprepared, <em>asaṅkhata</em>. The term <em>akataññū</em> highlights
that fact of realization.</p>
<p>The most extraordinary and marvellous thing about the realization of Nibbāna is
that it gives an assurance not only of matters pertaining to this life,
<em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, but also of what happens after death, <em>samparāyika</em> – in other
words, the realization of the cessation of existence.</p>
<p>Nibbāna as the realization here and now of the cessation of existence,
<em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em>, carries with it the assurance that there is no more
existence after death. So there is only one <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>. The verse we
already quoted, too, ends with the words <em>pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino</em>,
“those steadfastly such like ones have given up all forms of existence”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn658-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn658">22</a></sup></p>
<p>One thing should be clear now. Though there are two Nibbāna elements called
<em>sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> and <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em>, there is no
justification whatsoever for taking <em>anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu</em> as a place of
eternal rest for the <em>arahants</em> after death – an everlasting immortal state.</p>
<p>The deathlessness of Nibbāna is to be experienced in this world itself. That is
why an <em>arahant</em> is said to feast on ambrosial deathlessness, <em>amataṁ
paribhuñjati</em>, when he is in <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>. When it is time for death,
he brings his mind to this <em>samādhi</em>, and it is while he is partaking of
ambrosial deathlessness that Māra quietly takes away his body.</p>
<p>An <em>arahant</em> might even cremate his own body, as if it is another’s.</p>
<p>Now we are at an extremely deep point in this Dhamma. We have to say something
in particular about the two terms <em>saṅkhata</em> and <em>asaṅkhata</em>. In our last
sermon, we happened to give a rather unusual explanation of such pair-wise terms
like the ‘hither shore’ and the ‘farther shore’, as well as the ‘mundane’ and
the ‘supramundane’.</p>
<p>The two terms in each pair are generally believed to be far apart and the gap
between them is conceived in terms of time and space. But we compared this gap
to that between the lotus leaf and the drop of water on it, availing ourselves
of a simile offered by the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>The distance between the lotus leaf and the drop of water on it is the same as
that between the hither shore and the farther shore, between the mundane and the
supramundane. This is no idle sophistry, but a challenge to deeper reflection.</p>
<p>The <em>Dhammapada</em> verse we quoted earlier beginning with <em>yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,
pārāpāraṁ na vijjati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn659-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn659">23</a></sup> “to whom there is neither a farther shore nor a
hither shore nor both”, is puzzling enough. But what it says is that the
<em>arahant</em> has transcended both the hither shore and the farther shore. It is as
if he has gone beyond this shore and the other shore as well, that is to say, he
has transcended the dichotomy.</p>
<p>We have to say something similar with regard to the two terms <em>saṅkhata</em> and
<em>asaṅkhata</em>. <em>Saṅkhata</em>, or the prepared, is like a floral design. This prepared
floral design, which is <em>bhava</em>, or existence, is made up, as it were, with the
help of the glue of craving, the tangles of views and the knots of conceits.</p>
<p>If one removes the glue, disentangles the tangles and unties the knots, the
<em>saṅkhata</em>, or the prepared, itself becomes <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the unprepared, then
and there. The same floral design, which was the <em>saṅkhata</em>, has now become the
<em>asaṅkhata</em>. This itself is the cessation of existence, <em>bhavanirodho</em>. When one
can persuade oneself to think of Nibbāna as an extinguishment, the term
<em>parinibbāna</em> can well be understood as ‘perfect extinguishment’.</p>
<p>The <em>parinibbāna</em> of the <em>arahant</em> Dabba Mallaputta is recorded in the <em>Udāna</em>
as a special occasion on which the Buddha uttered a paean of joy. Venerable
Dabba Mallaputta was an <em>arahant</em>, gifted with marvellous psychic powers,
specializing in miracles performed by mastering the fire element, <em>tejo dhātu</em>.
His <em>parinibbāna</em>, too, was a marvel in itself.</p>
<p>When he found himself at the end of his life span, he approached the Buddha and
informed him of it, as if begging permission, with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>parinibbāna kālo me dāni, sugata</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn660-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn660">24</a></sup></p>
<p>it is time for me to attain <em>parinibbāna</em>, O well-gone one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha too gave permission with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yassa dāni tvaṁ, Dabba, kālaṁ maññasi</em>,</p>
<p>Dabba, you may do that for which the time is fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as the Buddha uttered these words, Venerable Dabba Mallaputta rose from
his seat, worshipped the Buddha, circumambulated him, went up into the sky and,
sitting cross-legged, aroused the concentration of the fire element and, rising
from it, attained <em>parinibbāna</em>. As his body thus miraculously self-cremated
burnt in the sky, it left no ashes or soot.</p>
<p>This was something significant that fits in with the definition of Nibbāna so
far given. That is probably why the Buddha is said to have uttered a special
verse of uplift or paean of joy at this extinguishment, which was perfect in
every sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Abhedi kāyo, nirodhi saññā,</em> <br />
<em>vedanā sītirahaṁsu sabbā,</em> <br />
<em>vūpasamiṁsu saṅkhārā,</em> <br />
<em>viññānaṁ attham agamā.</em></p>
<p>Body broke up, perceptions ceased, <br />
All feelings cooled off, <br />
Preparations calmed down, <br />
Consciousness came to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This event was of such a great importance that, though it occurred at Veḷuvana
Ārāma in Rājagaha, the Buddha related the event to the congregation of monks
when he returned to Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>It was not an incidental mention in reply to a particular question, but a
special peroration recounting the event and commemorating it with the following
two <em>Udāna</em> verses, which so aptly constitute the grand finale to our <em>Udāna</em>
text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayoghanahatass’eva,</em> <br />
<em>jalato jātavedaso,</em> <br />
<em>anupubbūpasantassa,</em> <br />
<em>yathā na ñāyate gati.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ sammāvimuttānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kāmabandhoghatārinaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>paññāpetuṁ gatī natthi,</em> <br />
<em>pattānaṁ acalaṁ sukhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn661-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn661">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as in the case of a fire <br />
Blazing like a block of iron in point of compactness, <br />
When it gradually calms down, <br />
No path it goes by can be traced.</p>
<p>Even so of those who are well released, <br />
Who have crossed over the floods of shackles of sensuality, <br />
And reached Bliss Unshaken, <br />
There is no path to be pointed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have deviated from the commentarial interpretation in our rendering of the
first two lines of the verse. The commentary gives two alternative meanings,
probably because it is in doubt as to the correct one. Firstly it brings in the
idea of a bronze vessel that is being beaten at the forge with an iron hammer,
giving the option that the gradual subsidence mentioned in the verse may apply
either to the flames or to the reverberations of sound arising out of
it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn662-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn662">26</a></sup> Secondly, as a ‘some say so’ view, <em>kecidvāda</em>, it gives an
alternative meaning, connected with the ball of iron beaten at the forge.</p>
<p>In our rendering, however, we had to follow a completely different line of
interpretation, taking the expression <em>ayoghanahatassa</em> as a comparison,
<em>ayoghanahatassa + iva</em>, for the blazing fire, <em>jalato jātavedaso</em>. On seeing a
fire that is ablaze, one gets a notion of compactness, as on seeing a red hot
block of solid iron.</p>
<p>In the <em>Dhammapada</em> verse beginning with <em>seyyo ayogulo bhutto, tatto
aggisikhūpamo</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn663-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn663">27</a></sup> “better to swallow a red hot iron ball, that resembles a
flame of fire”, a cognate simile is employed somewhat differently. There the
ball of iron is compared to a flame of fire. Here the flame of fire is compared
to a block of iron.</p>
<p>All in all, it is highly significant that the Buddha uttered three verses of
uplift in connection with the <em>parinibbāna</em> of the <em>arahant</em> Venerable Dabba
Mallaputta. The most important point that emerges from this discussion is that
Nibbāna is essentially an extinction or extinguishment.</p>
<p>An extinguished fire goes nowhere. In the case of other <em>arahants</em>, who were
cremated after their <em>parinibbāna</em>, there is a left over as ashes for one to
perpetuate at least the memory of their existence. But here Venerable Dabba
Mallaputta, as if to drive a point home, through his psychic powers based on the
fire element, saw to it that neither ashes nor soot will mar his perfect
extinguishment in the eyes of the world. That is why the Buddha celebrated it
with these special utterances of joy.</p>
<p>So then the cessation of existence is itself Nibbāna. There is no everlasting
immortal Nibbāna awaiting the <em>arahants</em> at their <em>parinibbāna</em>.</p>
<p>That kind of argument the commentaries sometimes put forward is now and then
advanced by modern day writers and preachers, too, in their explanations. When
it comes to Nibbāna, they resort to two pet parables of recent origin, the
parable of the tortoise and the parable of the frog.</p>
<p>In the former, a tortoise goes down into the water and the fishes ask him where
he came from. The tortoise replies that he came from land. In order to determine
what sort of a thing land is, the fishes go on asking the tortoise a number of
questions based on various qualities of water. To each question the tortoise has
to reply in the negative, since land has none of the qualities of water.</p>
<p>The parable of the frog is much the same. When it gets into water it has to say
‘no no’ to every question put by the toad, still unfamiliar with land. To make
the parables convincing, those negative answers, the ‘no-nos’, are compared to
the strings of negative terms that are found in the sutta passages dealing with
the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, which we have already quoted.</p>
<p>For instance, to prove their point those writers and teachers would resort to
the famous <em>Udāna</em> passage beginning with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ, yattha n’eva pathavī na āpo na tejo na vāyo
na ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ na viññāṇānañcāyatanaṁ na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ na
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ na ayaṁ loko na paraloko na ubho candimasūriyā
…</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn664-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn664">28</a></sup></p>
<p>There is, monks, that sphere, in which there is neither earth, nor water, nor
fire, nor air; neither the sphere of infinite space, nor the sphere of
infinite consciousness, nor the sphere of nothingness, nor the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception; neither this world nor the world
beyond, nor the sun and the moon …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we have reasonably pointed out that those passages do not in any way refer
to a non-descript realm into which the <em>arahants</em> enter after their demise, a
realm that the tortoise and the frog cannot describe. Such facile explanations
contradict the deeper teachings on the cessation of existence, dependent arising
and not self. They create a lot of misconceptions regarding Nibbāna as the
ultimate aim.</p>
<p>The purpose of all those arguments is to assert that Nibbāna is definitely not
an annihilation. The ideal of an everlasting Nibbāna is held out in order to
obviate nihilistic notions. But the Buddha himself has declared that when he is
preaching about the cessation of existence, those who held on to eternalist
views wrongly accused him for being an annihilationist, who teaches about the
annihilation, destruction and non-existence of a truly existing being, <em>sato
satassa ucchedaṁ vināsaṁ vibhavaṁ paññāpeti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn665-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn665">29</a></sup></p>
<p>On such occasions, the Buddha did not in any way incline towards eternalism in
order to defend himself. He did not put forward the idea of an everlasting
Nibbāna to counter the accusation. Instead, he drew attention to the three
signata and the four noble truths and solved the whole problem. He maintained
that the charge is groundless and utterly misconceived, and concluded with the
memorable declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>pubbe cāhaṁ, bhikkhave, etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi, dukkhassa ca
nirodhaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>formerly as well as now, O monks, I point out only a suffering and a cessation
of that suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the term <em>tathāgata</em>, according to him, is not to be conceived as a self.
It is only a mass of suffering that has come down through <em>saṁsāra</em>, due to
ignorance. The so-called existence, <em>bhava</em>, is an outcome of grasping,
<em>upādāna</em>. When grasping ceases, existence comes to an end. That itself is the
cessation of existence, <em>bhavanirodha</em>, which is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>As the term <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em> suggests, there is no grasping in the
experience of the cessation of existence. It is only when one is grasping
something that he can be identified with it, or reckoned by it. When one lets go
of everything, he goes beyond reckoning. Of course, even the commentaries
sometimes use the expression <em>apaññattikabhāvaṁ gatā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn666-1"><a href="sermon-19.html#fn-fn666">30</a></sup> “gone to the
state beyond designation” with regard to the <em>parinibbāna</em> of <em>arahants</em>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they tacitly grant a destination, which in their opinion defies
definition. Such vague arguments are riddled with contradictions. They obfuscate
the deeper issues of the Dhamma, relating to <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> and <em>anattā</em>,
and seek to perpetuate personality view by slanting towards eternalism.</p>
<p>It is to highlight some extremely subtle aspects of the problem of Nibbāna that
we brought out all these arguments today.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twentieth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we described, as something of a marvel in the attainment of
Nibbāna, the very possibility of realizing, in this very life, as
<em>diṭṭhadhammika</em>, one’s after death state, which is <em>samparāyika</em>. The phrase
<em>diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā</em>, “having realized here and now by
one’s own higher knowledge”,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn668-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn668">2</a></sup> occurs so often in the discourses because
the emancipated one ascertains his after death state as if by seeing with his
own eyes.</p>
<p><em>Natthidāni punabbhavo</em>, ‘there is no re-becoming now’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn669-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn669">3</a></sup> <em>khīṇā jāti</em>,
‘extinct is birth’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn670-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn670">4</a></sup> are some of the joyous utterances of the Buddha and
the <em>arahants</em>, which were inspired by the realization of the cessation of
existence in this very life.</p>
<p>Through that realization itself, they experience a bliss devoid of feeling,
which is called ‘the cooling off of feelings’. That is why Nibbāna as such is
known as <em>avedayita sukha</em>, a ‘bliss devoid of feeling’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn671-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn671">5</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of their lives, at the moment when death approaches, those
emancipated ones, the <em>arahants</em>, put forward their unshakeable deliverance of
the mind, <em>akuppā cetomivutti</em> (which remains unshaken even in the face of
death), and become deathless well before their death, not after it.</p>
<p>On many an occasion the Buddha has spoken highly of this unshakeable deliverance
of the mind, describing it as the supreme bliss, the supreme knowledge and the
supreme freedom from death. For instance, among the Sixes of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>, we come across the following two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassa sammā vimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>ñāṇaṁ ce hoti tādino,</em> <br />
<em>’akuppā me vimuttī’ti,</em> <br />
<em>bhavasaṁyojanakkhaye.</em></p>
<p><em>Etaṁ kho paramaṁ ñāṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ sukhamanuttaraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>asokaṁ virajaṁ khemaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ ānaṇyamuttamaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn672-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn672">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To that such like one, who is fully released, <br />
There arises the knowledge: <br />
‘Unshakeable is my deliverance’, <br />
Upon his extinction of fetters to existence.</p>
<p>This is the highest knowledge, <br />
This is the unsurpassed bliss, <br />
This sorrow-less, taintless security, <br />
Is the supreme debtless-ness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Arahants</em> are said to be debtless in regard to the four requisites offered by
the laity out of faith, but when Nibbāna is regarded as a debtless-ness, it
seems to imply something deeper.</p>
<p><em>Saṁsāra</em> or reiterated existence is itself a debt, which one can never pay off.
When one comes to think of <em>kamma</em> and its result, it is a debt that keeps on
gathering an interminable interest, which can never be paid off.</p>
<p>But even from this debt the <em>arahants</em> have won freedom by destroying the seeds
of <em>kamma</em>, by rendering them infertile. They are made ineffective beyond this
life, as there is no rebirth. The meaningful line of the <em>Ratanasutta</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>khīṇaṁ purāṇaṁ, navaṁ natthi sambhavaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn673-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn673">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whatever is old is extinct and there is no arising anew,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has to be understood in that sense. The karmic debt is paid off and there is no
fresh incurring.</p>
<p>All this is in praise of that unshakeable deliverance of the mind. It is a kind
of extraordinary knowledge, almost unimaginable, a ‘real’-ization of one’s own
after death state.</p>
<p>In almost all serious discussions on Nibbāna, the subtlest moot point turns out
to be the question of the after death state of the emancipated one. A brief
answer, the Buddha had given to this question, we already brought up in our last
sermon, by quoting the two concluding verses of the <em>Udāna</em>, with which that
collection of inspired utterances ends with a note of exceptional grandeur. Let
us recall them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayoghanahatass’eva,</em> <br />
<em>jalato jātavedaso,</em> <br />
<em>anupubbūpasantassa,</em> <br />
<em>yathā na ñāyate gati.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ sammāvimuttānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kāmabandhoghatārinaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>paññāpetuṁ gati natthi,</em> <br />
<em>pattānaṁ acalaṁ sukhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn674-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn674">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as in the case of a fire, <br />
Blazing like a block of iron in point of compactness, <br />
When it gradually calms down, <br />
No path it goes by can be traced.</p>
<p>Even so, of those who are well released, <br />
Who have crossed over the flux of shackles of sensuality, <br />
And reached bliss unshaken, <br />
There is no path to be pointed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two lines are particularly significant. There is no path to be pointed
out of those who have reached bliss unshaken. <em>Acalaṁ sukhaṁ</em>, or ‘unshakeable
bliss’, is none other than that unshakeable deliverance of the mind.</p>
<p><em>Akuppa</em> means ‘unassailable’ or ‘unshakeable’. Clearly enough, what the verse
says is that after their death the emancipated ones leave no trace of a path
gone by, even as the flames of a raging fire.</p>
<p>The flame may appear as something really existing due to the perception of the
compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>, but when it goes down and disappears, no one can say that
it went in such and such a direction.</p>
<p>Though this is the obvious meaning, some try to attribute quite a different
meaning to the verse in question. The line <em>paññāpetuṁ gati natthi</em>, “there is
no path to be pointed out”, is interpreted even by the commentators (who take
the word <em>gati</em> to mean some state of existence) as an assertion that, although
such a bourne cannot be pointed out, the <em>arahants</em> pass away into some
non-descript realm.</p>
<p>This kind of interpretation is prompted by an apprehension of the charge of
annihilation. A clear instance of this tendency is revealed in the commentary to
the following verse in the <em>Dhammapada</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ahiṁsakā ye munayo,</em> <br />
<em>niccaṁ kāyena saṁvutā,</em> <br />
<em>te yanti accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yattha gantvā na socare.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn675-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn675">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Innocent are the sages, <br />
That are ever restrained in body, <br />
They go to that state unshaken, <br />
Wherein they grieve no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentator, in paraphrasing, brings in the word <em>sassataṁ</em>, ‘eternal’, for
<em>accutaṁ</em>, thereby giving the idea that the <em>arahants</em> go to an eternal place of
rest.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn676-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn676">10</a></sup> Because the verb <em>yanti</em>, ‘go’, occurs there, he must have thought
that this state unshaken, <em>accutaṁ</em>, is something attainable after death.</p>
<p>But we can give another instance in support of our explanation of the term
<em>accutaṁ</em>. The following verse in the <em>Hemakamāṇavapucchā</em> of the
<em>Pārāyanavagga</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> clearly shows what this <em>accutaṁ</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha diṭṭhasutamutaviññātesu,</em> <br />
<em>piyarūpesu Hemaka,</em> <br />
<em>chandarāgavinodanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nibbānapadaṁ accutaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn677-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn677">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The dispelling here in this world of desire and lust, <br />
In pleasurable things, <br />
Seen, heard, sensed and cognized, <br />
Is the unshaken state of Nibbāna, O Hemaka.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further proof of the fact that there is no eternal immortal rest
awaiting the <em>arahants</em> after their demise.</p>
<p>The reason for such a postulate is probably the fear of falling into the
annihilationist view. Why this chronic fear? To the worldlings overcome by
craving for existence any teaching that leads to the cessation of existence
appears dreadful.</p>
<p>That is why they put forward two new parables, following the same commentarial
trend. The other day we mentioned about those two parables, the parable of the
tortoise and the parable of the frog.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn678-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn678">12</a></sup> When the fish and the toad living
in water ask what sort of a thing land is, the tortoise and the frog are forced
to say ‘no, no’ to every question they put. Likewise the Buddha, so it is
argued, was forced to give a string of negative terms in his discourses on
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>But we have pointed out that this argument is fallacious and that those
discourses have to be interpreted differently. The theme that runs through such
discourses is none other than the cessation of existence.</p>
<p>In the <em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> the Buddha declares in
unmistakeable terms that some recluses and brahmins, on hearing him preaching
the Dhamma for the cessation of existence, wrongly accuse him with the charge of
being an annihilationist, <em>sato sattassa ucchedaṁ vināsaṁ vibhavaṁ paññāpeti</em>,
“he is showing the way to the annihilation, destruction and non-existence of a
truly existing being”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn679-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn679">13</a></sup></p>
<p>He clearly states that some even grieve and lament and fall into despair,
complaining <em>ucchijjissāmi nāma su, vinassissāmi nāma su, na su nāma
bhavissāmi</em>, “so it seems I shall be annihilated, so it seems I shall perish, so
it seems I shall be no more”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn680-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn680">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Even during the lifetime of the Buddha there were various debates and
controversies regarding the after death state of the emancipated person among
recluses and brahmins. They were of the opinion that the after death state of
the emancipated one in any particular religious system has to be explained
according to a fourfold logic, or tetralemma. A paradigm of that tetralemma
occurs quite often in the discourses. It consists of the following four
propositions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>, <br />
“The Tathāgata exists after death”</li>
<li><em>na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>, <br />
“The Tathāgata does not exist after death”</li>
<li><em>hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>, <br />
“The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death”</li>
<li><em>n’eva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn681-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn681">15</a></sup> <br />
“The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This four-cornered logic purports to round up the four possible alternatives in
any situation, or four possible answers to any question.</p>
<p>The dilemma is fairly well known, where one is caught up between two
alternatives. The tetralemma, with its four alternatives, is supposed to exhaust
the universe of discourse in a way that one cannot afford to ignore it.</p>
<p>When it comes to a standpoint regarding a particular issue, one is compelled to
say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, or at least to assert both standpoints or negate them
altogether. The contemporary recluses and brahmins held on to the view that the
Tathāgata’s after death state has to be predicated in accordance with the
four-cornered logic.</p>
<p>When we hear the term Tathāgata, we are immediately reminded of the Buddha. But
for the contemporary society, it was a sort of technical term with a broader
meaning. Those recluses and brahmins used the term Tathāgata to designate the
perfected individual in any religious system, whose qualifications were summed
up in the thematic phrase <em>uttamapuriso, paramapuriso,
paramapattipatto</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn682-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn682">16</a></sup> “the highest person, the supreme person, the one who
has attained the supreme state”.</p>
<p>This fact is clearly borne out by the <em>Kutūhalasālāsutta</em> in the <em>Avyākata
Saṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. In that discourse we find the wandering
ascetic Vacchagotta coming to the Buddha with the following report.</p>
<p>Recently there was a meeting of recluses, brahmins and wandering ascetics in the
debating hall. In that assembly, the following chance talk arose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there is this teacher, Pūraṇa Kassapa, who is widely acclaimed and who
has a large following. When an ordinary disciple of his passes away, he
predicates his destiny. So also in the case of a disciple who has attained the
highest state of perfection in his religious system. Other well known teachers
like Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha
Kaccāyana and Ajita Kesakambali do the same. They all declare categorically
the after death state of both types of their disciples.</p>
<p>But as for this ascetic Gotama, who also is a teacher widely acclaimed with a
large following, the position is that he clearly declares the after death
state of an ordinary disciple of his, but in the case of a disciple who has
attained the highest state of perfection, he does not predicate his destiny
according to the above mentioned tetralemma. Instead he makes such a
declaration about him as the following:</p>
<p><em>Acchecchi taṇhaṁ, vāvattayi saññojanaṁ, sammā mānābhisamayā antam akāsi
dukkhassa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn683-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn683">17</a></sup></p>
<p>“he cut off craving, disjoined the fetter and, by rightly understanding
conceit for what it is, made an end of suffering”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vacchagotta concludes this account with the confession that he himself was
perplexed and was in doubt as to how the Dhamma of the recluse Gotama has to be
understood. The Buddha grants that Vacchagotta’s doubt is reasonable, with the
words</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>alañhi te, Vaccha, kaṅkhituṁ, alaṁ vicikicchituṁ, kaṅkhaniye ca pana te ṭhāne
vicikicchā uppannā</em>,</p>
<p>it behoves you to doubt, Vaccha, it behoves you to be perplexed, for doubt
has arisen in you on a dubious point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha comes out with the correct standpoint in order to dispel
Vacchagotta’s doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sa-upādānassa kvāhaṁ, Vaccha, upapattiṁ paññāpemi, no anupādānassa</em>,</p>
<p>it is for one with grasping, Vaccha, that I declare there is an occurrence of
birth, not for one without grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gives the following simile by way of illustration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, Vaccha, aggi sa-upādāno jalati no anupādāno, evam eva kvāhaṁ,
Vaccha, sa-upādānassa upapattiṁ paññāpemi, no anupādānassa</em>,</p>
<p>just as a fire burns when it has fuel to grasp and not when it has no fuel,
even so, Vaccha, I declare that there is an occurrence of birth for one with
grasping, not for one without grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have mentioned before, the word <em>upādāna</em> has two meanings, it means both
grasping as well as fuel. In fact fuel is just what the fire ‘grasps’. Just as
the fire depends on grasping in the form of fuel, so also the individual depends
on grasping for his rebirth.</p>
<p>Within the context of this analogy, Vacchagotta now raises a question that has
some deeper implications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yasmiṁ pana, bho Gotama, samaye acci vātena khittā dūrampi gacchati, imassa
pana bhavaṁ Gotamo kim upādānasmiṁ paññāpeti</em>,</p>
<p>Master Gotama, at the time when a flame flung by the wind goes even far, what
does Master Gotama declare to be its object of grasping or fuel?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s answer to that question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yasmiṁ kho, Vaccha, samaye acci vātena khittā dūrampi gacchati, tamahaṁ
vātupādānaṁ vadāmi; vāto hissa, Vaccha, tasmiṁ samaye upādānaṁ hoti</em>,</p>
<p>at the time, Vaccha, when a flame flung by the wind goes even far, that, I
say, has wind as its object of grasping. Vaccha, at that time wind itself
serves as the object of grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is only an analogy. Vaccha raises the question proper only at this
point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yasmiñca pana, bho Gotama, samaye imañca kāyaṁ nikkhipati satto ca aññataraṁ
kāyam anuppatto hoti, imassa pana bhavaṁ Gotamo kim upādānasmiṁ paññāpeti</em>,</p>
<p>at the time, Master Gotama, when a being lays down this body and has reached
a certain body, what does Master Gotama declare to be a grasping in his case?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yasmiñca pana, Vaccha, samaye imañca kāyaṁ nikkhipati satto ca aññataraṁ
kāyam anuppatto hoti, tam ahaṁ taṇhupādānaṁ vadāmi; taṇhā hissa, Vaccha,
tasmiṁ samaye upādānaṁ hoti</em>,</p>
<p>at the time, Vaccha, when a being lays down this body and has reached a
certain body, I say, he has craving as his grasping. At that time, Vaccha, it
is craving that serves as a grasping for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this sentence the discourse ends abruptly, but there is an intricate point
in the two sections quoted above. In these two sections, we have adopted the
reading <em>anuppatto</em>, ‘has reached’, as more plausible in rendering the phrase
<em>aññataraṁ kāyam anuppatto</em>, “has reached a certain body”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn684-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn684">18</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentary, however, seeks to justify the reading <em>anupapanno</em>, ‘is not
reborn’, which gives quite an opposite sense, with the following explanation
<em>cutikkhaṇeyeva paṭisandhicittassa anuppannattā anuppanno hoti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn685-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn685">19</a></sup> “since
at the death moment itself, the rebirth consciousness has not yet arisen, he is
said to be not yet reborn”.</p>
<p>Some editors doubt whether the correct reading should be <em>anuppatto</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn686-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn686">20</a></sup>
The doubt seems reasonable enough, for even syntactically, <em>anuppatto</em> can be
shown to fit into the context better than <em>anuppanno</em>. The word <em>aññataraṁ</em>
provides us with the criterion. It has a selective sense, like ‘a certain’, and
carries definite positive implications. To express something negative a word
like <em>aññaṁ</em>, ‘another’, has to be used instead of the selective <em>aññataraṁ</em>, ‘a
certain’.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the suggested reading <em>anuppatto</em> avoids those syntactical
difficulties. A being lays down this body and has reached a certain body. Even
the simile given as an illustration is in favour of our interpretation. The
original question of Vaccha about the flame flung by the wind, reminds us of the
way a forest fire, for instance, spreads from one tree to another tree some
distance away. It is the wind that pushes the flame for it to catch hold of the
other tree.</p>
<p>The commentarial explanation, however, envisages a situation in which a being
lays down this body and is not yet reborn in another body. It is in the interim
that craving is supposed to be the grasping or a fuel. Some scholars have
exploited this commentarial explanation to postulate a theory of <em>antarābhava</em>,
or interim existence, prior to rebirth proper.</p>
<p>Our interpretation, based on the reading <em>anuppatto</em>, rules out even the
possibility of an <em>antarābhava</em>. Obviously enough, Vacchagotta’s question is
simple and straightforward. He is curious to know what sort of a grasping
connects up the being that lays down the body and the being that arises in
another body. That is to say, how the apparent gap could be bridged.</p>
<p>The answer given by the Buddha fully accords with the analogy envisaged by the
premise. Just as the wind does the work of grasping in the case of the flame, so
craving itself, at the moment of death, fulfils the function of grasping for a
being to reach another body.</p>
<p>That is precisely why craving is called <em>bhavanetti</em>, “the guide in
becoming”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn687-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn687">21</a></sup> Like a promontory, it juts out into the ocean of <em>saṁsāra</em>.
When it comes to rebirth, it is craving that bridges the apparent gap. It is the
invisible combustible fuel that keeps the raging <em>saṁsāric</em> forest fire alive.</p>
<p>All in all, what transpired at the debating hall (<em>Kutūhalasālā</em>) reveals one
important fact, namely that the Buddha’s reluctance to give a categorical answer
regarding the after death state of the emancipated one in his dispensation had
aroused the curiosity of those recluses and brahmins. That is why they kept on
discussing the subject at length.</p>
<p>However, it was not the fact that he had refused to make any comment at all on
this point. Only, that the comment he had made appeared so strange to them, as
we may well infer from Vacchagotta’s report of the discussion at the debating
hall.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s comment on the subject, which they had quoted, was not based on the
tetralemma. It was a completely new formulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchecchi taṇhaṁ, vāvattayi saññojanaṁ, sammā mānābhisamayā antamakāsi
dukkhassa</em>,</p>
<p>he cut off craving, disjoined the fetter and, by rightly understanding conceit
for what it is, made an end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This then, is the correct answer, and not any one of the four corners of the
tetralemma. This brief formula is of paramount importance. When craving is cut
off, the ‘guide-in-becoming’, which is responsible for rebirth, is done away
with. It is as if the fetter binding to another existence has been unhooked.</p>
<p>The term <em>bhavasaṁyojanakkhaya</em>, “destruction of the fetter to existence”, we
came across earlier, conveys the same sense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn688-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn688">22</a></sup></p>
<p>The phrase <em>sammā mānābhisamaya</em> is also highly significant. With the dispelling
of ignorance, the conceit ‘am’, <em>asmimāna</em>, is seen for what it is. It
disappears when exposed to the light of understanding and that is the end of
suffering as well. The concluding phrase <em>antam akāsi dukkhassa</em>, “made an end
of suffering”, is conclusive enough. The problem that was there all the time was
the problem of suffering, so the end of suffering means the end of the whole
problem.</p>
<p>In the <em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> the Buddha’s response to
the question of the after death state of the <em>arahant</em> comes to light in greater
detail. The question is presented there in the form of the tetralemma, beginning
with <em>hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn689-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn689">23</a></sup></p>
<p>While all the other recluses and brahmins held that the answer should
necessarily take the form of one of the four alternatives, the Buddha put them
all aside, <em>ṭhapitāni,</em> rejected them, <em>patikkhittāni</em>, refused to state his
view categorically in terms of them, <em>avyākatāni</em>.</p>
<p>This attitude of the Buddha puzzled not only the ascetics of other sects, but
even some of the monks like Māluṅkyāputta. In very strong terms, Māluṅkyāputta
challenged the Buddha to give a categorical answer or else confess his
ignorance.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn690-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn690">24</a></sup></p>
<p>As a matter of fact there are altogether ten such questions, which the Buddha
laid aside, rejected and refused to answer categorically. The first six take the
form of three dilemmas, while the last four constitute the tetralemma already
mentioned. Since an examination of those three dilemmas would reveal some
important facts, we shall briefly discuss their significance as well.</p>
<p>The three sets of views are stated thematically as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>sassato loko,</em> “the world is eternal”</li>
<li><em>asassato loko,</em> “the world is not eternal”</li>
<li><em>antavā loko</em>, “the world is finite”</li>
<li><em>anantavā loko</em>, “the world is infinite”</li>
<li><em>taṁ jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ</em>, “the soul and the body are the same”</li>
<li><em>aññaṁ jīvaṁ aññaṁ sarīraṁ</em>, “the soul is one thing and the body another”.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three dilemmas, together with the tetralemma, are known as
<em>abyākatavatthūni</em>, the ten undetermined points.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn691-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn691">25</a></sup> Various recluses and
brahmins, as well as king Pasenadi Kosala, posed these ten questions to the
Buddha, hoping to get categorical answers.</p>
<p>Why the Buddha laid them aside is a problem to many scholars. Some, like
Māluṅkyāputta, would put it down to agnosticism. Others would claim that the
Buddha laid them aside because they are irrelevant to the immediate problem of
deliverance, though he could have answered them. That section of opinion go by
the <em>Siṁsapāvanasutta</em> in the <em>Saccasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn692-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn692">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Once while dwelling in a <em>siṁsapā</em> grove, the Buddha took up some <em>siṁsapā</em>
leaves in his hands and asked the monks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you think, monks, which is more, these leaves in my hand or those in
the <em>siṁsapā</em> grove?”</p>
<p>The monks reply that the leaves in the hand are few and those in the <em>siṁsapā</em>
grove are greater in number. Then the Buddha makes a declaration to the
following effect:</p>
<p>“Even so, monks, what I have understood through higher knowledge and not
taught you is far more than what I have taught you”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we rely on this simile, we would have to grant that the questions are
answerable in principle, but that the Buddha preferred to avoid them because
they are not relevant. But this is not the reason either.</p>
<p>All these ten questions are based on wrong premises. To take them seriously and
answer them would be to grant the validity of those premises. The dilemmas and
the tetralemma seek arbitrarily to corner anyone who tries to answer them. The
Buddha refused to be cornered that way.</p>
<p>The first two alternatives, presented in the form of a dilemma, are <em>sassato
loko,</em> “the world is eternal”, and <em>asassato loko,</em> “the world is not eternal”.
This is an attempt to determine the world in temporal terms. The next set of
alternatives seeks to determine the world in spatial terms.</p>
<p>Why did the Buddha refuse to answer these questions on time and space? It is
because the concept of ‘the world’ has been given quite a new definition in this
dispensation.</p>
<p>Whenever the Buddha redefined a word in common usage, he introduced it with the
phrase <em>ariyassa vinaye</em>, “in the discipline of the noble ones”.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned on an earlier occasion that according to the
discipline of the noble ones, ‘the world’ is said to have arisen in the six
sense-spheres, <em>chasu loko samuppanno</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn693-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn693">27</a></sup> In short, the world is redefined
in terms of the six spheres of sense. This is so fundamentally important that in
the <em>Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> the theme comes up again and
again.</p>
<p>For instance, in the <em>Samiddhisutta</em> Venerable Samiddhi poses the following
question to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>’<em>Loko, loko’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, loko vā assa
lokapaññatti vā?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn694-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn694">28</a></sup></p>
<p>‘The world, the world’, so it is said Venerable sir, but how far, Venerable
sir, does this world or the concept of the world go?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha gives the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha kho, Samiddhi, atthi cakkhu, atthi rūpā, atthi cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, atthi
cakkhuviññāṇaviññātabbā dhammā, atthi tattha loko vā lokapaññatti vā</em>,</p>
<p>Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms, where there is
eye-consciousness, where there are things cognizable by eye-consciousness,
there exists the world or the concept of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar statement is made with regard to the other spheres of sense, including
the mind. That, according to the Buddha, is where the world exists. Then he
makes a declaration concerning the converse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha ca kho, Samiddhi, natthi cakkhu, natthi rūpā, natthi cakkhuviññāṇaṁ,
natthi cakkhuviññāṇaviññātabbā dhammā, natthi tattha loko vā lokapaññatti vā</em>,</p>
<p>Where there is no eye, Samiddhi, where there are no forms, where there is no
eye-consciousness, where there are no things cognizable by eye-consciousness,
there the world does not exist, nor any concept of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we can well infer that any attempt to determine whether there is an
end of the world, either in temporal terms or in spatial terms, is misguided. It
is the outcome of a wrong view, for there is a world so long as there are the
six spheres of sense. That is why the Buddha consistently refused to answer
those questions regarding the world.</p>
<p>There are a number of definitions of the world given by the Buddha. We shall
cite two of them. A certain monk directly asked the Buddha to give a definition
of the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Loko, loko’ti bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, ’loko’ti vuccati?</em></p>
<p>‘The world, the world’, so it is said. In what respect, Venerable sir, is it
called a world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha makes the following significant declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Lujjatī’ti kho, bhikkhu, tasmā ’loko’ti vuccati. Kiñca lujjati? Cakkhu kho,
bhikkhu, lujjati, rūpā lujjanti, cakkhuviññāṇaṁ lujjati, cakkhusamphasso
lujjati, yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ
vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tampi lujjati. ’Lujjatī’ti kho, bhikkhu, tasmā ’loko’ti
vuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn695-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn695">29</a></sup></p>
<p>It is disintegrating, monk, that is why it is called ‘the world’. And what is
disintegrating? The eye, monk, is disintegrating, forms are disintegrating,
eye-consciousness is disintegrating, eye-contact is disintegrating, and
whatever feeling that arises dependent on eye-contact, be it pleasant, or
painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful, that too is disintegrating. It is
disintegrating, monk, that is why it is called ‘the world’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha is redefining the concept of the world, punning on the verb
<em>lujjati</em>, which means to ‘break up’ or ‘disintegrate’. To bring about a radical
change in outlook, in accordance with the Dhamma, the Buddha would sometimes
introduce a new etymology in preference to the old. This definition of ‘the
world’ is to the same effect.</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda, too, raises the same question, soliciting a redefinition for
the well-known concept of the world, and the Buddha responds with the following
answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kho, Ānanda, palokadhammaṁ, ayaṁ vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn696-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn696">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever, Ānanda, is subject to disintegration that is called ‘the world’ in
the noble one’s discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He even goes on to substantiate his statement at length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiñca, Ānanda, palokadhammaṁ? Cakkhuṁ kho, Ānanda, palokadhammaṁ, rūpā
palokadhammā, cakkhuviññāṇaṁ palokadhammaṁ, cakkhusamphasso palokadhammo,
yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā
adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tampi palokadhammaṁ. Yaṁ kho, Ānanda, palokadhammaṁ, ayaṁ
vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko</em>.</p>
<p>And what, Ānanda, is subject to disintegration? The eye, Ānanda, is subject to
disintegration, forms are subject to disintegration, eye-consciousness is
subject to disintegration, eye-contact is subject to disintegration, and
whatever feeling that arises dependent on eye-contact, be it pleasant, or
painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful, that too is subject to
disintegration. Whatever is subject to disintegration, Ānanda, is called ‘the
world’ in the noble one’s discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this instance, the play upon the word <em>loka</em> is vividly apt in that it brings
out the transciency of the world. If the world by definition is regarded as
transient, it cannot be conceived substantially as a unit. How then can an
eternity or infinity be predicated about it? If all the so-called things in the
world, listed above, are all the time disintegrating, any unitary concept of the
world is fallacious.</p>
<p>Had the Buddha answered those misconceived questions, he would thereby concede
to the wrong concept of the world current among other religious groups. So then
we can understand why the Buddha refused to answer the first four questions.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the next dilemma, <em>taṁ jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ, aññaṁ jīvaṁ aññaṁ
sarīraṁ</em>, “the soul and the body are the same, the soul is one thing and the
body another”. To these questions also, the other religionists insisted on a
categorical answer, either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
<p>There is a ‘catch’ in the way these questions are framed. The Buddha refused to
get caught by them. These two questions are of the type that clever lawyers put
to a respondent these days. They would sometimes insist strictly on a ‘yes’ or
‘no’ as answer and ask a question like: “Have you now given up drinking?”</p>
<p>If the
respondent happens to be a teetotaller, he would be in a quandary, since both
answers tend to create a wrong impression.</p>
<p>So also in the case of these two alternatives, “the soul and the body are the
same, the soul is one thing and the body another”. Either way there is a
presumption of a soul, which the Buddha did not subscribe to. The Buddha had
unequivocally declared that the idea of soul is the outcome of an utterly
foolish view, <em>kevalo paripūro bāladhammo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn697-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn697">31</a></sup> That is why the Buddha
rejected both standpoints.</p>
<p>A similar ‘catch’, a similar misconception, underlies the tetralemma concerning
the after death state of the Tathāgata. It should be already clear to some
extent by what we have discussed so far.</p>
<p>For the Buddha, the term Tathāgata had a different connotation than what it
meant for those of other sects. The latter adhered to the view that both the
ordinary disciple as well as the perfected individual in their systems of
thought had a soul of some description or other.</p>
<p>The Buddha never subscribed to such a view. On the other hand, he invested the
term Tathāgata with an extremely deep and subtle meaning. His definition of the
term will emerge from the <em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em>, which we propose to discuss
now.</p>
<p>In this discourse we find the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta trying to get a
categorical answer to the questionnaire, putting each of the questions with
legal precision one by one, as a lawyer would at the courts of law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁ nu kho, bho Gotamo, ’sassato loko, idam eva saccaṁ, mogham aññan’ti, evaṁ
diṭṭhi bhavaṁ Gotamo?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn698-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn698">32</a></sup></p>
<p>“Now, Master Gotama, ‘the world is eternal, this only is true, all else is
false’, are you of this view, Master Gotama?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replies: <em>na kho ahaṁ, Vaccha, evaṁ diṭṭhi</em>, “no, Vaccha, I am not of
this view”.</p>
<p>Then Vacchagotta puts the opposite standpoint, which too the Buddha answers in
the negative. To all the ten questions the Buddha answers ‘no’, thereby
rejecting the questionnaire in toto. Then Vacchagotta asks why, on seeing what
danger, the Buddha refuses to hold any of those views. The Buddha gives the
following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Sassato loko’ti kho, Vaccha, diṭṭhigatam etaṁ diṭṭhigahanaṁ diṭṭhikantāraṁ
diṭṭhivisūkaṁ diṭṭhivipphanditaṁ diṭṭhisaṁyojanaṁ sadukkhaṁ savighātaṁ
sa-upāyāsaṁ sapariḷāhaṁ, na nibbidāya na virāgāya na nirodhāya na upasamāya na
abhiññāya na sambodhāya na nibbānāya saṁvattati</em>.</p>
<p>Vaccha, this speculative view that the world is eternal is a jungle of views,
a desert of views, a distortion of views, an aberration of views, a fetter of
views, it is fraught with suffering, with vexation, with despair, with
delirium, it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
tranquillity, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with regard to the other nine views.</p>
<p>Now here we find both the above-mentioned reasons. Not only the fact that these
questions are not relevant to the attainment of Nibbāna, but also the fact that
there is something wrong in the very statement of the problems. What are the
dangers that he sees in holding any of these views?</p>
<p>Every one of them is just a speculative view, <em>diṭṭhigataṁ</em>, a jungle of views,
<em>diṭṭhigahanaṁ</em>, an arid desert of views, <em>diṭṭhikantāraṁ</em>, a mimicry or a
distortion of views, <em>diṭṭhivisūkaṁ</em>, an aberration of views,
<em>diṭṭhivipphanditaṁ</em>, a fetter of views, <em>diṭṭhisaṁyojanaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>They bring about suffering, <em>sadukkhaṁ</em>, vexation, <em>savighātaṁ</em>, despair,
<em>sa-upāyāsaṁ</em>, delirium, <em>sapariḷāhaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>They do not conduce to disenchantment, <em>na nibbidāya</em>, to dispassion, <em>na
virāgāya</em>, to cessation, <em>na nirodhāya</em>, to tranquillity, <em>na upasamāya</em>, to
higher knowledge, <em>na abhiññāya</em>, to enlightenment, <em>na sambodhāya</em>, to
extinguishment, <em>na nibbānāya</em>.</p>
<p>From this declaration it is obvious that these questions are ill founded and
misconceived. They are a welter of false views, so much so that the Buddha even
declares that these questions simply do not exist for the noble disciple, who
has heard the Dhamma. They occur as real problems only to the untaught
worldling. Why is that?</p>
<p>Whoever has a deep understanding of the four noble truths would not even raise
these questions. This declaration should be enough for one to understand why the
Buddha refused to answer them.</p>
<p>Explaining that it is because of these dangers that he rejects them in toto, the
Buddha now makes clear what his own stance is. Instead of holding any of those
speculative views, he has seen for himself the rise, <em>samudaya</em>, and fall,
<em>atthagama</em>, of the five aggregates as a matter of direct experience, thereby
getting rid of all ‘I’-ing and ‘my’-ing and latencies to conceits, winning
ultimate release.</p>
<p>Even after this explanation Vacchagotta resorts to the fourfold logic to satisfy
his curiosity about the after death state of the monk thus released in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ vimuttacitto pana, bho Gotamo, bhikkhu kuhiṁ uppajjati?</em></p>
<p>When a monk is thus released in mind, Master Gotama, where is he reborn?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uppajjatī’ti kho, Vaccha, na upeti</em>,</p>
<p>To say that he is reborn, Vaccha, falls short of a reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Vacchagotta asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tena hi, bho Gotama, na uppajjati?</em></p>
<p>If that is so, Master Gotama, is he not reborn?</p>
<p><em>Na uppajjatī’ti kho, Vaccha, na upeti</em>,</p>
<p>To say that he is not reborn, Vaccha, falls short of a reply.</p>
<p><em>Tena hi, bho Gotama, uppajjati ca na ca uppajjati</em>?</p>
<p>If that is so, Master Gotama, is he both reborn and is not reborn?</p>
<p><em>Uppajjati ca na ca uppajjatī’ti kho, Vaccha, na upeti</em>,</p>
<p>To say that he is both reborn and is not reborn, Vaccha, falls short of a
reply.</p>
<p><em>Tena hi, bho Gotama, neva uppajjati na na uppajjati?</em></p>
<p>If that is so, Master Gotama, is he neither reborn nor is not reborn?</p>
<p><em>Neva uppajjati na na uppajjatī’ti kho, Vaccha, na upeti</em>,</p>
<p>To say that he is neither reborn nor is not reborn, Vaccha, falls short of a
reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this unexpected response of the Buddha to his four questions, Vacchagotta
confesses that he is fully confused and bewildered. The Buddha grants that his
confusion and bewilderment are understandable, since this Dhamma is so deep and
subtle that it cannot be plumbed by logic, <em>atakkāvacaro</em>.</p>
<p>However, in order to give him a clue to understand the Dhamma point of view, he
gives an illustration in the form of a catechism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṁ kiṁ maññasi, Vaccha, sace te purato aggi jaleyya, jāneyyāsi tvaṁ ’ayaṁ me
purato aggi jalatī’ti?</em></p>
<p>What do you think, Vaccha, suppose a fire were burning before you, would you
know ‘this fire is burning before me’?</p>
<p><em>Sace me, bho Gotama, purato aggi jaleyya, jāneyyāhaṁ ’ayaṁ me purato aggi
jalatī’ti.</em></p>
<p>If, Master Gotama, a fire were burning before me, I would know ‘this fire is
burning before me’.</p>
<p><em>Sace pana taṁ, Vaccha, evaṁ puccheyya ’yo te ayaṁ purato aggi jalati, ayaṁ
aggi kiṁ paṭicca jalatī’ti, evaṁ puṭṭho tvaṁ, Vaccha, kinti byākareyyāsi?</em></p>
<p>If someone were to ask you, Vaccha, ‘what does this fire that is burning
before you burns in dependence on’, being asked thus, Vaccha, what would you
answer?</p>
<p><em>Evaṁ puṭṭho ahaṁ, bho Gotama, evaṁ byākareyyaṁ ’yo me ayaṁ purato aggi
jalati, ayaṁ aggi tiṇakaṭṭhupādānaṁ paṭicca jalatī’ti</em>.</p>
<p>Being asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer ‘this fire burning before me
burns in dependence on grass and sticks’.</p>
<p><em>Sace te, Vaccha, purato so aggi nibbāyeyya, jāneyyāsi tvaṁ ’ayaṁ me purato
aggi nibbuto’ti?</em></p>
<p>If that fire before you were to be extinguished, Vaccha, would you know ‘this
fire before me has been extinguished’?</p>
<p><em>Sace me, bho Gotamo, purato so aggi nibbāyeyya, jāneyyāhaṁ ’ayaṁ me purato
aggi nibbuto’ti.</em></p>
<p>If that fire before me were to be extinguished, Master Gotama, I would know
‘this fire before me has been extinguished’.</p>
<p><em>Sace pana taṁ, Vaccha, evaṁ puccheyya ’yo te ayaṁ purato aggi nibbuto, so
aggi ito katamaṁ disaṁ gato, puratthimaṁ vā dakkhiṇaṁ vā pacchimaṁ vā uttaraṁ
vā’ti, evaṁ puṭṭho tvaṁ, Vaccha, kinti byākareyyāsi?</em></p>
<p>If someone were to ask you, Vaccha, when that fire before you were
extinguished, ‘to which direction did it go, to the east, the west, the north
or the south’, being asked thus, what would you answer?</p>
<p><em>Na upeti, bho Gotama, yañhi so, bho Gotama, aggi tiṇakaṭṭhupādānaṁ paṭicca
jalati, tassa ca pariyādānā aññassa ca anupahārā anāhāro nibbuto tveva saṅkhaṁ
gacchati.</em></p>
<p>That wouldn’t do as a reply, Master Gotama, for that fire burnt in dependence
on its fuel of grass and sticks. That being used up and not getting any more
fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point a very important expression comes up, which we happened to discuss
earlier too, namely <em>saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn699-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn699">33</a></sup> It means ‘to be reckoned’, or
‘to be known as’, or ‘to be designated’. So the correct mode of designation in
this case is to say that the fire is reckoned as ‘extinguished’, and not to say
that it has gone somewhere.</p>
<p>If one takes mean advantage of the expression ‘fire has gone out’ and insists on
locating it, it will only be a misuse or an abuse of linguistic usage. It
reveals a pervert tendency to misunderstand and misinterpret. Therefore, all
that can be said by way of predicating such a situation, is <em>nibbuto tveva
saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em>, “it is reckoned as ‘extinguished’”.</p>
<p>Now comes a well-timed declaration in which the Buddha, starting right from
where Vacchagotta leaves off, brings the whole discussion to a climactic end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evameva kho, Vaccha, yena rūpena tathāgataṁ paññāpayamāno paññāpeyya, taṁ
rūpaṁ tathāgatassa pahīnaṁ ucchinnamūlaṁ tālāvatthukataṁ anabhāvakataṁ āyatiṁ
anuppādadhammaṁ. Rūpasaṅkhāvimutto kho, Vaccha, tathāgato, gambhīro appameyyo
duppariyogāho, seyyathāpi mahāsamuddo. Uppajjatī’ti na upeti, na uppajjatī’ti
na upeti, uppajjati ca na ca uppajjatī’ti na upeti, neva uppajjati na na
uppajjatī’ti na upeti.</em></p>
<p>Even so, Vaccha, that form by which one designating the Tathāgata might
designate him, that has been abandoned by him, cut off at the root, made like
an uprooted palm tree, made non-existent and incapable of arising again. The
Tathāgata is free from reckoning in terms of form, Vaccha, he is deep,
immeasurable and hard to fathom, like the great ocean. To say that he is
reborn falls short of a reply, to say that he is not reborn falls short of a
reply, to say that he is both reborn and is not reborn falls short of a reply,
to say that he is neither reborn nor is not reborn falls short of a reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declaration, which a fully convinced Vacchagotta now wholeheartedly hailed
and compared to the very heartwood of a <em>Sāla</em> tree, enshrines an extremely
profound norm of Dhamma.</p>
<p>It was when Vacchagotta had granted the fact that it is improper to ask in which
direction an extinguished fire has gone, and that the only proper linguistic
usage is simply to say that ‘it is extinguished’, that the Buddha came out with
this profound pronouncement concerning the five aggregates.</p>
<p>In the case of the Tathāgata, the aggregate of form, for instance, is abandoned,
<em>pahīnaṁ</em>, cut off at the root, <em>ucchinnamūlaṁ</em>, made like an uprooted palm tree
divested from its site, <em>tālāvatthukataṁ</em>, made non existent, <em>anabhavakataṁ</em>,
and incapable of arising again, <em>āyatiṁ anuppādadhammaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Thereby the Tathāgata becomes free from reckoning in terms of form,
<em>rūpasaṅkhāvimutto kho tathāgato</em>. Due to this very freedom, he becomes deep,
immeasurable and unfathomable like the great ocean. Therefore he cannot be said
to be reborn, or not to be reborn, or both or neither. The abandonment of form,
referred to above, comes about not by death or destruction, but by the
abandonment of craving.</p>
<p>The fact that by the abandonment of craving itself, form is abandoned, or
eradicated, comes to light from the following quotation from the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe kho, Rādha, yo chando yo rāgo yā nandī yā taṇhā, taṁ pajahatha. Evaṁ taṁ
rūpaṁ pahīnaṁ bhavissati ucchinnamūlaṁ tālāvatthukataṁ anabhāvakataṁ āyatiṁ
anuppādadhammaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn700-1"><a href="sermon-20.html#fn-fn700">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Rādha, you give up that desire, that lust, that delight, that craving for
form. It is thus that form comes to be abandoned, cut off at the root, made
like an uprooted palm tree, made non-existent and incapable of arising again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldlings are under the impression that an <em>arahant’s</em> five aggregates of
grasping get destroyed at death. But according to this declaration, an <em>arahant</em>
is like an uprooted palm tree. A palm tree uprooted but left standing, divested
of its site, might appear as a real palm tree to one who sees it from a
distance. Similarly, an untaught worldling thinks that there is a being or
person in truth and fact when he hears the term Tathāgata, even in this context
too.</p>
<p>This is the insinuation underlying the above quoted pronouncement. It has some
profound implications, but time does not permit us to go into them today.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-first sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The other day we discussed, to some extent, the ten questions known as the ‘ten
indeterminate points’, <em>dasa avyākatavatthūni</em>, which the Buddha laid aside,
refusing to give a categorical answer as ‘yes’ or ‘no’. We pointed out, that the
reason why he refused to answer them was the fact that they were founded on some
wrong views, some wrong assumptions. To give categorical answers to such
questions would amount to an assertion of those views. So he refrained from
giving clear-cut answers to any of those questions.</p>
<p>Already from our last sermon, it should be clear, to some extent, how the
eternalist and annihilationist views peep through them. The tetralemma on the
after-death state of the Tathāgata, which is directly relevant to our theme,
also presupposes the validity of those two extreme views. Had the Buddha given a
categorical answer, he too would be committing himself to the presumptions
underlying them.</p>
<p>The middle path he promulgated to the world is one that transcended both those
extremes. It is not a piecemeal compromise between them. He could have presented
a half-way solution by taking up one or the other of the last two standpoints,
namely “the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death”, or “the
Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”. But instead of
stooping to that position, he rejected the questionnaire in toto.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he brought in a completely new mode of analysis, illustrative
of the law of dependent arising underlying the doctrine of the four noble
truths, in order to expose the fallacy of those questions.</p>
<p>The other day we happened to mention the conclusive answer given by the Buddha
to the question raised by the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta in the
<em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, concerning the after death
state of the Tathāgata. But we had no time to discuss it at length. Therefore
let us take it up again.</p>
<p>When the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta had granted the incongruity of any
statement to the effect that the extinguished fire has gone in such and such a
direction, and the fact that the term Nibbāna is only a reckoning or a turn of
speech, the Buddha follows it up with the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evameva kho, Vaccha, yena rūpena tathāgataṁ paññāpayamāno paññāpeyya, taṁ
rūpaṁ tathāgatassa pahīnaṁ ucchinnamūlaṁ tālāvatthukataṁ anabhāvakataṁ āyatiṁ
anuppādadhammaṁ. Rūpasaṅkhāvimutto kho, Vaccha, tathāgato, gambhīro appameyyo
duppariyogāho, seyyathāpi mahāsamuddo. Uppajjatī’ti na upeti, na uppajjatī’ti
na upeti, uppajjati ca na ca uppajjatī’ti na upeti, neva uppajjati na na
uppajjatī’ti na upeti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn702-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn702">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Even so, Vaccha, that form by which one designating the Tathāgata might
designate him, that has been abandoned by him, cut off at the root, made like
an uprooted palm tree, made non-existent and incapable of arising again. The
Tathāgata is free from reckoning in terms of form, Vaccha, he is deep,
immeasurable and hard to fathom, like the great ocean. To say that he is
reborn falls short of a reply, to say that he is not reborn falls short of a
reply, to say that he is both reborn and is not reborn falls short of a reply,
to say that he is neither reborn nor is not reborn falls short of a reply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the case of the aggregate of form, so also with regard to the aggregates
of feeling, perception, preparations and consciousness, that is to say, in
regard to all the five aggregates of grasping, the Buddha made this particular
declaration. From this it is clear, that in this dispensation the Tathāgata
cannot be reckoned in terms of any one of the five aggregates.</p>
<p>The similes reveal to us the state of the Tathāgata – the simile of the uprooted
tree, for instance. On seeing a palm tree uprooted, but somehow left standing,
one would mistake it for a growing palm tree. The worldling has a similar notion
of the Tathāgata. This simile of the tree reminds us of the
<em>Isidattatheragāthā</em>, which has an allusion to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pañcakkhandhā pariññātā,</em> <br />
<em>tiṭṭhanti chinnamūlakā,</em> <br />
<em>dukkhakkhayo anuppatto,</em> <br />
<em>patto me āsavakkhayo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn703-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn703">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Five aggregates, now fully understood, <br />
Just stand, cut off at their root, <br />
Reached is suffering’s end, <br />
Extinct for me are influxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On reaching <em>arahanthood</em>, one finds oneself in this strange situation. The
occurrence of the word <em>saṅkhā</em> in this connection is particularly significant.
This word came up in our discussion of the term <em>papañca</em> in the contexts
<em>papañcasaṅkhā</em> and <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn704-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn704">4</a></sup></p>
<p>There we had much to say about the word. It is synonymous with <em>samaññā</em>,
‘appellation’, and <em>paññatti</em>, ‘designation’. Reckoning, appellation and
designation are synonymous to a great extent. So the concluding statement of the
Buddha, already quoted, makes it clear that the Tathāgata cannot be reckoned or
designated in terms of form, though he has form, he cannot be reckoned by
feeling, though he experiences feeling, nor can he be reckoned by, or identified
with, the aggregates of perceptions, preparations or consciousness.</p>
<p>Now in order to make a reckoning, or a designation, there has to be a duality, a
dichotomy. We had occasion to touch upon this normative tendency to dichotomize.
By way of illustration we may refer to the fact that even the price of an
article can be reckoned, so long as there is a vortex between supply and demand.</p>
<p>There has to be some kind of vortex between two things, for there to be a
designation. A vortex, or <em>vaṭṭa</em>, is an alternation between two things, a
cyclic interrelation. A designation can come in only so long as there is such a
cyclic process. Now the Tathāgata is free from this duality.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the dichotomy between consciousness and name-and-form
is the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex. Let us refresh our memory of this vortex by alluding
to a quotation from the <em>Udāna</em> which we brought up on an earlier occasion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chinnaṁ vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>es’ ev’ anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn705-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn705">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The whirlpool cut off whirls no more. <br />
This, even this, is suffering’s end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in fact, is a reference to the <em>arahant</em>. The vortex is between
consciousness and name-and-form. By letting go of name-and-form, and realizing
the state of a non-manifestative consciousness, the <em>arahant</em> has, in this very
life, realized the cessation of existence, which amounts to a cessation of
suffering as well. Though he continues to live on, he does not grasp any of
those aggregates tenaciously. His consciousness does not get attached to
name-and-form. That is why it is said that the vortex turns no more.</p>
<p>To highlight this figure of the vortex, we can bring up another significant
quotation from the <em>Upādānaparivaṭṭasutta</em> and the <em>Sattaṭṭhānasutta</em> of the
<em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye suvimuttā te kevalino, ye kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi
paññāpanāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn706-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn706">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Those who are fully released, are truly alone, and for them who are truly
alone, there is no whirling round for purposes of designation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement might sound rather queer. The term <em>kevalī</em> occurs not only in
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, but in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> as well, with reference to the
<em>arahant</em>. The commentary to the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, <em>Paramatthajotikā</em>, gives the
following definition to the term when it comes up in the <em>Kasibhāradvājasutta</em>:
<em>sabbaguṇaparipuṇṇaṁ sabbayogavisaṁyuttaṁ vā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn707-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn707">7</a></sup> According to the
commentator, this term is used for the <em>arahant</em> in the sense that he is perfect
in all virtues, or else that he is released from all bonds.</p>
<p>But going by the implications of the word <em>vaṭṭa</em>, associated with it, we may
say that the term has a deeper meaning. From the point of view of etymology, the
word <em>kevalī</em> is suggestive of singularity, full integration, aloofness and
solitude. We spoke of a letting go of name-and-form. The non-manifestative
consciousness, released from name-and-form, is indeed symbolic of the
<em>arahant’s</em> singularity, wholeness, aloofness and solitude.</p>
<p>In the following verse from the <em>Dhammapada</em>, which we had quoted earlier too,
this release from name-and-form is well depicted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kodhaṁ jahe vippajaheyya mānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁyojanaṁ sabbam atikkameyya,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ nāmarūpasmim asajjamānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>akiñcanaṁ nānupatanti dukkhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn708-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn708">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Let one put wrath away and conceit abandon, <br />
And get well beyond all fetters as well, <br />
That one, untrammelled by name-and-form, <br />
With naught as his own, no pains befall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We came across another significant reference to the same effect in the
<em>Māghasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye ve asattā vicaranti loke,</em> <br />
<em>akiñcanā kevalino yatattā,</em> <br />
<em>kālena tesu havyaṁ pavecche,</em> <br />
<em>yo brāhmaṇo puññapekho yajetha.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn709-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn709">9</a></sup></p>
<p>They who wander unattached in the world, <br />
Owning naught, aloof, restrained, <br />
To them in time, let the brahmin offer, <br />
That oblation, if merit be his aim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse also makes it clear, that a freedom from ownings and attachments is
implicit in the term <em>kevalī</em>. It has connotations of full integration and
aloofness. The term <em>kevala</em>, therefore, is suggestive of the state of release
from that vortex.</p>
<p>If, for instance, a vortex in the ocean comes to cease, can one ask where the
vortex has gone? It will be like asking where the extinguished fire has gone.
One might say that the vortex has ‘joined’ the ocean. But that, too, would not
be a proper statement to make. From the very outset what in fact was there was
the great ocean, so one cannot say that the vortex has gone somewhere, nor can
one say that it is not gone. It is also incorrect to say that it has joined the
ocean.</p>
<p>A cessation of a vortex gives rise to such a problematic situation. So is this
state called <em>kevalī</em>. What, in short, does it amount to? <strong>The vortex has now
become the great ocean itself. That is the significance of the comparison of the
emancipated one to the great ocean</strong>.</p>
<p>The commentators do not seem to have paid sufficient attention to the
implications of this simile. But when one thinks of the relation between the
vortex and the ocean, it is as if the <em>arahant</em> has become one with the ocean.
But this is only a turn of speech.</p>
<p>In reality, the vortex is merely a certain pervert state of the ocean itself.
That perversion is now no more. It has ceased. It is because of that perversion
that there was a manifestation of suffering. <strong>The cessation of suffering could
therefore be compared to the cessation of the vortex, leaving only the great
ocean as it is</strong>.</p>
<p>Only so long as there is a whirling vortex can we point out a ‘here’ and a
‘there’. In the vast ocean, boundless as it is, where there is a vortex, or an
eddy, we can point it out with a ‘here’ or a ‘there’.</p>
<p>Even so, in the case of the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual, as long as the whirling round
is going on in the form of the vortex, there is a possibility of designation or
appellation as ‘so-and-so’. But once the vortex has ceased, there is actually
nothing to identify with, for purposes of designation. The most one can say
about it, is to refer to it as the place where a vortex has ceased.</p>
<p>Such is the case with the Tathāgata too. Freedom from the duality is for him
release from the vortex itself. We have explained on a previous occasion how a
vortex comes to be.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn710-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn710">10</a></sup> A current of water, trying to go against the
mainstream, when its attempt is foiled, in clashing with the mainstream, gets
thrown off and pushed back, but turns round to go whirling and whirling as a
whirlpool. This is not the norm. This is something abnormal. Here is a
perversion resulting from an attempt to do the impossible. This is how a thing
called ‘a vortex’ comes to be.</p>
<p>The condition of the <em>saṁsāric</em> being is somewhat similar. What we are taught as
the four ‘perversions’ in the Dhamma, describe these four pervert attitudes of a
<em>saṁsāric</em> being.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceiving permanence in the impermanent</li>
<li>Perceiving pleasure in the painful</li>
<li>Perceiving beauty in the foul</li>
<li>Perceiving a self in the not-self.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>saṁsāric</em> individual tries to forge ahead in existence, misled by these
four pervert views. The result of that attempt is the vortex between
consciousness and name-and-form, a recurrent process of whirling round and
round.</p>
<p>Because of this process of whirling round, as in a vortex, there is an unreality
about this world. What for us appears as the true and real state of the world,
the Buddha declares to be false and unreal. We have already quoted on an earlier
occasion the verse from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which
clearly illustrates this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anattani attamāniṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passa lokaṁ sadevakaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>niviṭṭhaṁ nāmarūpasmiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>idaṁ saccan’ti maññati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn711-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn711">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just see the world, with all its gods, <br />
Fancying a self where none exists, <br />
Entrenched in name-and-form it holds <br />
The conceit that this is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the world entrenched in name-and-form takes to be real, it seems is unreal,
according to this verse. This idea is reinforced by the following refrain-like
phrase in the <em>Uragasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sabbaṁ vitatham idan’ti ñatvā loke,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn712-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn712">12</a></sup></p>
<p>knowing that everything in this world is not ‘such’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have referred to the special significance of the <em>Uragasutta</em> on several
occasions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn713-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn713">13</a></sup> That discourse enjoins a giving up of everything, like the
sloughing off of a worn-out skin by a serpent. Now a serpent sheds its worn-out
skin by understanding that it is no longer the real skin.</p>
<p>Similarly, one has to understand that everything in the world is not ‘such’.
<em>Tathā</em> is ‘such’. Whatever is ‘as-it-is’, is <em>yathābhūta</em>. To be ‘as-it-is’, is
to be ‘such’. What is not ‘as-it-is’, is <em>ayathā</em> or <em>vitatha</em>, ‘unsuch’ or ‘not
such’, that is to say, unreal.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that the vortex whirling between consciousness and
name-and-form, in the case of <em>saṁsāric</em> beings, is something not ‘such’. It is
not the true state of affairs in the world. To be free from this aberration,
this unreal state of duality, is to be an <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>The three unskilful mental states of greed, hate and delusion are the outcome of
this duality itself. So long as the whirling goes on, there is friction
manifesting itself, sometimes as greed and sometimes as hate. Delusion impels
and propels both. It is just one current of water that goes whirling round and
round, bringing about friction and conflict. This interplay between
consciousness and name-and-form is actually a pervert state, abnormal and
unreal. To be a Tathāgata is a return to reality and suchness, from this unreal,
unsuch, pervert state.</p>
<p>We happened to mention earlier that the term Tathāgata was already current among
ascetics of other sects. But it is not in the same sense that the Buddha used
this term. For those of other sects, the term Tathāgata carried with it the
prejudice of a soul or a self, even if it purported to represent the ideal of
emancipation.</p>
<p>But in this dispensation, the Tathāgata is defined differently. <em>Tathā</em>, ‘even
so’, ‘thus’, is the correlative of <em>yathā</em>, ‘just as’, ‘in whatever way’. <strong>At
whatever moment it becomes possible to say that ‘as is the ocean, so is the
vortex now’, then, it is the state of Tathāgata.</strong></p>
<p>The vortex originated by deviating from the course of the main stream of the
ocean. But if an individual, literally so-called, gave up such pervert
attitudes, as seeing permanence in what is impermanent, if he got rid of the
four perversions by the knowledge and insight into things as-they-are, then he
comes to be known as a Tathāgata.</p>
<p>He is a ‘thus gone’, in the sense that, as is the norm of the world, ‘thus’ he
is now. There is also an alternative explanation possible, etymologically.
<em>Tathatā</em> is a term for the law of dependent arising.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn714-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn714">14</a></sup> It means
‘thusness’ or ‘suchness’. This particular term, so integral to the understanding
of the significance of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, or ‘dependent arising’, is almost
relegated to the limbo in our tradition.</p>
<p>Tathāgata could therefore be alternatively explained as a return to that
‘thusness’ or ‘suchness’, by comprehending it fully. In this sense, the
derivation of the term could be explained analytically as <em>tatha + āgata</em>.
Commentators, too, sometimes go for this etymology, though not exactly in this
sense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn715-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn715">15</a></sup></p>
<p>According to this idea of a return to the true state of suchness, we may say
that <strong>there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the ocean, when a vortex
ceases</strong>. Why? Because what was found both inside the vortex and outside of it
was simply water. So is the case with the <em>saṁsāric</em> individual.</p>
<p>What we have to say from here onwards, regarding this <em>saṁsāric</em> individual, is
directly relevant to meditation. As we mentioned on an earlier occasion, the
four elements, earth, water, fire and air, are to be found both internally and
externally.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> we come across a way
of reflection that leads to insight in the following instruction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā c’ eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavidhātu, yā ca bāhirā paṭhavidhātu,
paṭhavidhātur ev’ esā. Taṁ netaṁ mama, neso ’haṁ asmi, na meso attā’ti
evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn716-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn716">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Now whatever earth element that is internal, and whatever earth element that
is external, both are simply earth element. That should be seen as it is with
right wisdom thus: ‘this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is that this so-called individual, or person, is in fact a
vortex, formed out of the same kind of primary elements that obtain outside of
it. So then, the whole idea of an individual or a person is a mere perversion.
The notion of individuality in <em>saṁsāric</em> beings is comparable to the apparent
individuality of a vortex. It is only a pretence. That is why it is called
<em>asmimāna</em>, the “conceit ‘am’”. In truth and fact, it is only a conceit.</p>
<p>This should be clear when one reflects on how the pure air gets caught up into
this vortex as an in-breath, only to be ejected after a while as a foul
out-breath. Portions of primary elements, predominating in earth and water, get
involved with this vortex as food and drink, to make a few rounds within, only
to be exuded as dirty excreta and urine. This way, one can understand the fact
that what is actually there is only a certain delimitation or measuring as
‘internal’ and ‘external’.</p>
<p>What sustains this process of measuring or reckoning is the duality – the notion
that there are two things. So then, the supreme deliverance in this dispensation
is release from this duality. Release from this duality is at the same time
release from greed and hate.</p>
<p>Ignorance is a sort of going round, in a winding pattern, as in the case of a
coil. Each round seems so different from the previous one, a peculiar novelty
arising out of the forgetting or ignoring trait, characteristic of ignorance.</p>
<p>However much one suffers in one life cycle, when one starts another life cycle
with a new birth, one is in a new world, in a new form of existence. The
sufferings in the previous life cycle are almost forgotten. The vast cycle of
<em>saṁsāra</em>, this endless faring round in time and space, is like a vortex.</p>
<p>The vortical interplay between consciousness and name-and-form has the same
background of ignorance. In fact, it is like the seed of the entire process. A
disease is diagnosed by the characteristics of the germ. Even so, the Buddha
pointed out, that the basic principle underlying the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex is
traceable to the vortical interplay between consciousness and name-and-form,
going on within our minds.</p>
<p>This germinal vortex, between consciousness and name-and-form, is an extremely
subtle one that eludes the limitations of both time and space. This, indeed, is
the timeless principle inherent in the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, or ‘dependent
arising’. Therefore, the solution to the whole problem lies in the understanding
of this law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>We have mentioned on a previous occasion that the <em>saṅkhata</em>, or the ‘prepared’,
becomes <em>asaṅkhata</em>, or the ‘unprepared’, by the very understanding of the
‘prepared’ nature of the <em>saṅkhata</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn717-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn717">17</a></sup> The reason is that the prepared
appears to be ‘so’, due to the lack of understanding of its composite and
prepared nature. This might well appear a riddle.</p>
<p>The faring round in <em>saṁsāra</em> is the result of ignorance. That is why final
deliverance is said to be brought about by <strong>wisdom</strong> in this dispensation. All
in all, one extremely important fact emerges from this discussion, namely the
fact that the etymology attributed to the term Tathāgata by the Buddha is highly
significant.</p>
<p>It effectively explains why he refused to answer the tetralemma concerning the
after death state of the Tathāgata. When a vortex has ceased, it is problematic
whether it has gone somewhere or joined the great ocean. Similarly, there is a
problem of identity in the case of a Tathāgata, even when he is living. This
simile of the ocean gives us a clue to a certain much-vexed riddle-like
discourse on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Many of those scholars, who put forward views on Nibbāna with an eternalist
bias, count on the <em>Pahārādasutta</em> found among the Eights of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn718-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn718">18</a></sup> In fact, that discourse occurs in the <em>Vinaya Cūḷavagga</em> and in
the <em>Udāna</em> as well.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn719-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn719">19</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <em>Pahārādasutta</em>, the Buddha gives a sustained simile, explaining eight
marvellous qualities of this dispensation to the <em>asura</em> king Pahārāda, by
comparing them to eight marvels of the great ocean. The fifth marvellous quality
is stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, Pahārāda, yā kāci loke savantiyo mahāsamuddam appenti, yā kāci
antalikkhā dhārā papatanti, na tena mahāsamuddassa ūnattaṁ vā pūrattaṁ vā
paññāyati, evam eva kho, Pahārāda, bahū ce pi bhikkhū anupādisesāya
nibbānadhātuyā parinibbāyanti, na tena nibbānadhātuyā ūnattaṁ vā pūrattaṁ va
paññāyati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn720-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn720">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as, Pahārāda, however many rivers of the world may flow into the great
ocean and however much torrential downpours may fall on it from the sky, no
decrease or increase is apparent in the great ocean, even so, Pahārāda,
although many monks may attain <em>parinibbāna</em> in the Nibbāna element without
residual clinging, thereby no decrease or increase is apparent in the Nibbāna
element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a number of scholars draw upon this passage when they put forward the view
that <em>arahants</em>, after their death, find some place of refuge which never gets
overcrowded. It is a ridiculous idea, utterly misconceived. It is incompatible
with this Dhamma, which rejects both eternalist and annihilationist views. Such
ideas seem to have been put forward due to a lack of appreciation of the
metaphorical significance of this particular discourse and a disregard for the
implications of this comparison of the <em>arahant</em> to the great ocean, in point of
his suchness or <em>tathatā</em>.</p>
<p>In the light of these facts, we have to conclude that Nibbāna is actually the
truth, and that <em>saṁsāra</em> is a mere perversion. That is why the
<em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em>, from which we have quoted earlier too, is fundamentally
important. It says that what the world takes as the truth, that the ariyans have
seen with wisdom as untruth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ pare sukhato āhu,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā āhu dukkhato,</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ pare dukkhato āhu,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā sukhato vidū.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn721-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn721">21</a></sup></p>
<p>What others may call bliss, <br />
That the ariyans make known as pain. <br />
What others may call pain, <br />
That the ariyans have known to be bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it effectively concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Passa dhammaṁ durājānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sampamūḷh’ ettha aviddasū.</em></p>
<p>Behold a norm, so had to grasp, <br />
Baffled herein are ignorant ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth of this profound declaration by the Buddha could be seen in these
deeper dimensions of the meaning of <em>tathatā</em>. By way of further clarification
of what we have already stated about the Tathāgata and the mode of answering
those questions about his after death state, we may now take up the
<em>Anurādhasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, which is of paramount importance in
this issue.</p>
<p>According to this discourse, when the Buddha was once dwelling in the gabled
hall in Vesalī, a monk named Anurādha was living in a hut in a jungle close by.
One day he was confronted with a situation, which shows that even a forest
dwelling monk cannot afford to ignore questions like this. A group of wandering
ascetics of other sects approached him and, seated in front of him, made this
pronouncement, as if to see his response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo so, āvuso Anurādha, tathāgato uttamapuriso paramapuriso paramapattipatto,
taṁ tathāgataṁ imesu catūsu ṭhānesu paññāpayamāno paññāpeti:</em></p>
<p><em>’Hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā’ti vā <br />
’na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā’ti vā <br />
’hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā’ti vā <br />
’neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā’ti vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn722-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn722">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend Anurādha, as to that Tathāgata, the highest person, the supreme person,
the one who has attained the supreme state, in designating him one does so in
terms of these four propositions:</p>
<p>‘the Tathāgata exists after death’, <br />
‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death’, <br />
‘the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’, <br />
‘the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What those ascetics of other sects wanted to convey, was that the state of the
Tathāgata after death could be predicated only by one of these four
propositions, constituting the tetralemma. But then Venerable Anurādha made the
following declaration, as if to repudiate that view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo so, āvuso, tathāgato uttamapuriso paramapuriso paramapattipatto, taṁ
tathāgataṁ aññatr’imehi catūhi ṭhānehi paññāpayamāno paññāpeti.</em></p>
<p>Friends, as to that Tathāgata, the highest person, the supreme person, the one
who has attained the supreme state, in designating him one does so apart from
these four propositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as he made this statement, those ascetics of other sects made the
derogatory remark: “This must be either a new-comer to the Order, just gone
forth, or a foolish incompetent elder.”</p>
<p>With this insult, they got up and left, and Venerable Anurādha fell to thinking:
“If those wandering ascetics of other sects should question me further, how
should I answer them creditably, so as to state what has been said by the
Exalted One, and not to misrepresent him. How should I explain in keeping with
the norm of Dhamma, so that there will be no justifiable occasion for
impeachment.”</p>
<p>With this doubt in mind, he approached the Buddha and related the whole episode.
The Buddha, however, instead of giving a short answer, led Venerable Anurādha
step by step to an understanding of the Dhamma, catechetically, by a wonderfully
graded path. First of all, he convinced Venerable Anurādha of the three
characteristics of existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Taṁ kiṁ maññasi, Anurādha, rūpaṁ niccaṁ vā aniccaṁ vā’ti.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Aniccaṁ bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Yaṁ panāniccaṁ dukkhaṁ vā taṁ sukhaṁ vā’ti.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Dukkhaṁ bhante.’</em></p>
<p><em>’Yaṁ panāniccaṁ dukkhaṁ vipariṇāmadhammaṁ kallaṁ nu taṁ samanupassituṁ: ’etaṁ
mama, eso ’ham asmi, eso me attā’ti.</em></p>
<p><em>‘No h’etaṁ bhante.’</em></p>
<p>“What do you think, Anurādha, is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p>“Impermanent, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p>“Suffering, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, fit to be regarded
thus: ‘This is mine, this am I, this is my self’?”</p>
<p>“No indeed, venerable sir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So also with regard to the other aggregates, the Buddha guided Venerable
Anurādha to the correct standpoint of the Dhamma, in this case by three steps,
and this is the first step.</p>
<p>He put aside the problem of the Tathāgata for a moment and highlighted the
characteristic of not-self out of the three signata, thereby convincing Anurādha
that what is impermanent, suffering and subject to change, is not fit to be
regarded as self. Now comes the second step, which is, more or less, a
reflection leading to insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmā ti ha, Anurādha, yaṁ kiñci rūpam atītānāgatapaccuppannam ajjhattaṁ vā
bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṁ vā sukhumaṁ vā hīnaṁ vā paṇītaṁ vā, yaṁ dūre santike vā,
sabbaṁ rūpaṁ ’netaṁ mama, neso ’ham asmi, na meso attā’ti
evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Yā kāci vedanā atītānāgatapaccuppannā … yā kāci saññā … ye keci saṅkhāra
… yaṁ kiñci viññāṇaṁ atītānāgatapaccuppannam ajjhattaṁ vā bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṁ
vā sukhumaṁ vā hīnaṁ vā paṇītaṁ vā, yaṁ dūre santike vā,
sabbaṁ viññāṇaṁ ’netaṁ mama, neso ’ham asmi, na meso attā’ti
evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ passaṁ, Anurādha, sutavā ariyasāvako rūpasmim pi nibbindati, vedanāya pi
nibbindati, saññāya pi nibbindati, saṅkhāresu pi nibbindati, viññāṇasmim pi
nibbindati. Nibbindaṁ virajjati, virāgā vimuccati, vimuttasmiṁ vimuttam iti
ñāṇaṁ hoti:</em></p>
<p><em>’khīṇā jāti vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ, kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ, nāparam itthattāyā’ti
pajānāti.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, Anurādha, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or
near, all form should be seen as it really is, with right wisdom thus: ‘This is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’.</p>
<p>Any kind of feelings whatsoever, whether past, future or present … any kind of
perception … any kind of preparations … any kind of consciousness
whatsoever, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as
it really is, with right wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self’.</p>
<p>Seeing thus, Anurādha, the instructed noble disciple gets disgusted of form,
gets disgusted of feeling, gets disgusted of perception, gets disgusted of
preparations, gets disgusted of consciousness. With disgust, he becomes
dispassionate, through dispassion his mind is liberated, when it is liberated,
there comes the knowledge ‘it is liberated’ and he understands:</p>
<p>‘Extinct is birth, lived is the holy life, done is what is to be done, there is
no more of this state of being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha is presenting a mode of reflection that culminates in
<em>arahanthood</em>. If one is prepared to accept the not-self standpoint, then what
one has to do, is to see with right wisdom all the five aggregates as not-self
in a most comprehensive manner. This is the second step.</p>
<p>Now, as the third step, the Buddha sharply addresses a series of questions to
Venerable Anurādha, to judge how he would determine the relation of the
Tathāgata, or the emancipated one, to the five aggregates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard feeling … perception … preparations … consciousness as
the Tathāgata?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from feeling?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in perception?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from perception?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in preparations?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from preparations?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in consciousness?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from consciousness?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is
without form, without feeling, without perception, without preparations,
without consciousness?”
“No, venerable sir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Venerable Anurādha gives negative answers to all these four modes of
questions, the Buddha draws the inevitable conclusion that accords with the
Dhamma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Ettha ca te, Anurādha, diṭṭheva dhamme saccato thetato tathāgate
anupalabbhiyamāne, kallaṁ nu te taṁ veyyākaraṇaṁ:</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yo so, āvuso, tathāgato uttamapuriso paramapuriso paramapattipatto, taṁ
tathāgataṁ aññatr’imehi catūhi ṭhānehi paññāpayamāno paññāpeti’?“</em></p>
<p><em>“No hetaṁ bhante.”</em></p>
<p>“So then, Anurādha, when for you a Tathāgata is not to be found in truth and
fact here in this very life, is it fitting for you to declare, as you did:</p>
<p>‘Friends, as to the Tathāgata, the highest person, the supreme person, the one
who has attained the supreme state, in designating him one does so apart from
these four propositions’?“</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conclusion, namely that the Tathāgata is not to be found in truth and fact
even in this very life, is one that drives terror into many who are steeped in
the craving for existence. But this, it seems, is the upshot of the catechism.</p>
<p>The rebuke of the wandering ascetics is justifiable, because the tetralemma
exhausts the universe of discourse and there is no way out. The Buddha’s reproof
of Anurādha amounts to an admission that <strong>even here and now the Tathāgata does
not exist in truth and fact, not to speak of his condition hereafter</strong>.</p>
<p>When Anurādha accepts this position, the Buddha expresses his approbation with
the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sādhu, sādhu, Anurādha, pubbe cāham Anurādha etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi
dukkhassa ca nirodhaṁ.</em></p>
<p>“Good, good, Anurādha, <strong>formerly as well as now I make known just suffering
and the cessation of suffering</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declaration makes it clear that the four noble truths are the teaching
proper and that terms like Tathāgata, <em>satta</em> and <em>pugala</em> are mere concepts. No
doubt, this is a disconcerting revelation. So let us see, whether there is any
possibility of salvaging the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>Now there is the word <em>upalabbhati</em> occurring in this context, which is supposed
to be rather ambiguous. In fact, some prefer to render it in such a way as to
mean the Tathāgata does exist, only that he cannot be traced.</p>
<p>Tathāgata, it seems, exists in truth and fact, though one cannot find him. This
is the way they get round the difficulty. But then, let us examine some of the
contexts in which the word occurs, to see whether there is a case for such an
interpretation.</p>
<p>A clear-cut instance of the usage of this expression comes in the <em>Vajirāsutta</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. The <em>arahant</em> nun Vajirā addresses the following
challenge to Māra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kinnu ’satto’ti paccesi,</em> <br />
<em>Māra diṭṭhigatannu te,</em> <br />
<em>suddhasaṅkhārapuñjo, yaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nayidha sattūpalabbhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn723-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn723">23</a></sup></p>
<p>What do you mean by a ‘being’, O Māra, <br />
Isn’t it a bigoted view, on your part, <br />
This is purely a heap of preparations, mind you, <br />
No being is to be found here at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context as well as the tone makes it clear that the word <em>upalabbhati</em>
definitely means “not to be found”, not that there is a being but one cannot
find it.</p>
<p>We may take up another instance from the <em>Purābhedasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>,
where the theme is the <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na tassa puttā pasavo vā,</em> <br />
<em>khettaṁ vatthuṁ na vijjati,</em> <br />
<em>attaṁ vāpi nirattaṁ vā,</em> <br />
<em>na tasmim upalabbhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn724-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn724">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Not for him are sons and cattle, <br />
He has no field or site to build, <br />
In him there is not to be found, <br />
Anything that is grasped or given up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words <em>attaṁ</em> and <em>nirattaṁ</em> are suggestive of the dichotomy from which the
<em>arahant</em> is free. The context unmistakeably proves that the expression <em>na
upalabbhati</em> means ‘not to be found’.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that the Buddha set aside the four questions forming the
tetralemma not because they are irrelevant from the point of view of Nibbāna,
despite the fact that he could have answered them.</p>
<p>That is to say, not that he could not, but that he would not. How can one say
that the question of an <em>arahant’s</em> after death state is totally irrelevant? So
that is not the reason.</p>
<p>The reason is that the questions are misleading. Those who posed these questions
had the presumption that the word Tathāgata implied a truly existing being or a
person. But the Buddha pointed out that the concept of a being or a person is
fallacious.</p>
<p>Though it is fallacious, for the worldling living in an illusory unreal world,
it has its place as a relative reality. Due to the very fact that it is grasped,
it is binding on him.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a worldling uses such terms as ‘I’ and ‘mine’, or a ‘being’ and
a ‘person’, it is not a mere way of expression. It is a level of reality proper
to the worldling’s scale of values.</p>
<p>But for the <em>arahants</em>, who have reached the state of suchness, it is a mere
concept. In fact, it becomes a mere concept in the context of the simile of the
vortex and the ocean. That is to say, in the case of the <em>arahants</em>, their five
aggregates resemble the flotsam and jetsam on the surface waters of a vortex
already ceased at its depth.</p>
<p>On seeing the Buddha and the <em>arahants</em>, one might still say, as a way of
saying, ‘here is the Buddha’, ‘here are the <em>arahants</em>’. For the Buddha, the
concept of a ‘being’ is something incompatible with his teaching from beginning
to end. But for the nonce he had to use it, as is evident from many a discourse.</p>
<p>The expression <em>aṭṭha ariyapuggalā</em>, ‘the eight noble persons’, includes the
<em>arahant</em> as well. Similarly in such contexts as the <em>Aggappasādasutta</em>, the
term <em>satta</em> is used indiscriminately, giving way to conventional usage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yāvatā, bhikkhave, sattā apadā va dipadā vā catuppadā vā bahuppadā vā rūpino
vā arūpino vā saññino vā asaññino vā nevasaññināsaññino vā, tathāgato tesaṁ
aggamakkhāyati arahaṁ sammāsambuddho.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn725-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn725">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatever kinds of beings there be, whether footless or two-footed, or
four-footed, or many footed, with form or formless, percipient or
non-percipient, or neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, among them the
Tathāgata, worthy and fully awakened, is called supreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the term <em>satta</em> occurs there, it is only by way of worldly parlance.
In truth and fact, however, there is no ‘being’ as such. In a previous sermon we
happened to mention a new etymology given by the Buddha to the term <em>loka</em>, or
‘world’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn726-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn726">26</a></sup></p>
<p>In the same way, he advanced a new etymology for the term <em>satta</em>. As mentioned
in the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, Venerable Rādha once posed the
following question to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Satto, satto’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, ’satto’ti
vuccati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn727-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn727">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Venerable sir, it is said ‘a being’, ‘a being’. To what extent can one be
called ‘a being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe … vedanāya … saññāya … saṅkhāresu … viññāṇe kho, Rādha, yo
chando yo rāgo yā nandī yā taṇhā, tatra satto, tatra visatto, tasmā ’satto’ti
vuccati</em>.</p>
<p>Rādha, that desire, that lust, that delight, that craving in form … feeling
… perception … preparations … consciousness, with which one is attached
and thoroughly attached to it, therefore is one called a ‘being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha is punning on the word <em>satta</em>, which has two meanings, a
‘being’ and ‘the one attached’. The etymology attributed to that word by the
Buddha brings out in sharp relief the attachment as well, whereas in his
redefinition of the term <em>loka</em>, he followed an etymology that stressed the
disintegrating nature of the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn728-1"><a href="sermon-21.html#fn-fn728">28</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Satto visatto, tasmā ’satto’ti vuccati,</em></p>
<p>attached, thoroughly attached, therefore is one called a ‘being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having given this new definition, the Buddha follows it up with a scintillating
simile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose, Rādha, some little boys and girls are playing with sand castles. So
long as their lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving for those things
have not gone away, they remain fond of them, they play with them, treat them
as their property and call them their own. But when, Rādha, those little boys
and girls have outgrown that lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving
for those sand castles, they scatter them with their hands and feet, demolish
them, dismantle them and render them unplayable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now comes the Buddha’s admonition, based on this simile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evam eva kho, Rādha, tumhe rūpaṁ … vedanaṁ … saññaṁ … saṅkhāre …
viññāṇaṁ vikiratha vidhamatha viddhaṁsetha vikīḷanikaṁ karotha taṇhakkhayāya
paṭipajjatha.</em></p>
<p>Even so, Rādha, you all scatter form … feeling … perception …
preparations … consciousness, demolish it, dismantle it and render it
unplayable. Practise for the destruction of craving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he winds up with that highly significant conclusive remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṇhakkhayo hi, Rādha, nibbānaṁ.</em></p>
<p>For, the destruction of craving, Rādha, is Nibbāna.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twentysecond sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>We made an attempt, in our last sermon, to explain that the comparison of the
emancipated one in this dispensation to the great ocean has a particularly deep
significance. We reverted to the simile of the vortex by way of explanation.
Release from the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex, or the breach of the vortex of <em>saṁsāra</em>, is
comparable to the cessation of a whirlpool. It is equivalent to the stoppage of
the whirlpool of <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, what is known as a vortex or a whirlpool, is a certain pervert,
unusual or abnormal activity, which sustains a pretence of an individual
existence in the great ocean with a drilling and churning as its centre. It is
an aberration, functioning according to a duality, maintaining a notion of two
things. As long as it exists, there is the dichotomy between a ‘here’ and a
‘there’, oneself and another. A vortex reflects a conflict between an ‘internal’
and an ‘external’ – a ‘tangle within’ and a ‘tangle without’. The cessation of
the vortex is the freedom from that duality. It is a solitude born of full
integration.</p>
<p>We happened to discuss the meaning of the term <em>kevalī</em> in our last sermon. The
cessation of a vortex is at once the resolution of the conflict between an
internal and an external, of the tangle within and without. When a vortex
ceases, all those conflicts subside and a state of peace prevails. What remains
is the boundless great ocean, with no delimitations of a ‘here’ and a ‘there’.
As is the great ocean, so is the vortex now.</p>
<p>This suchness itself indicates the stoppage, the cessation or the subsidence of
the vortex. There is no longer any possibility of pointing out a ‘here’ and a
‘there’ in the case of a vortex that has ceased. Its ‘thusness’ or ‘suchness’
amounts to an acceptance of the reality of the great ocean. That ‘thus-gone’
vortex, or the vortex that has now become ‘such’, is in every respect worthy of
being called <em>tathāgata</em>.</p>
<p>The term <em>tādī</em> is also semantically related to this suchness. The <em>tathāgata</em>
is sometimes referred to as <em>tādī</em> or <em>tādiso</em>, ‘such-like’. The ‘such-like’
quality of the <em>tathāgata</em> is associated with his unshakeable deliverance of the
mind. His mind remains unshaken before the eight worldly vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Why the Buddha refused to give an answer to the tetralemma concerning the
after-death state of the <em>tathāgata</em>, should be clear to a great extent by those
sutta quotations we brought up in our last sermon. Since the quotation</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭheva dhamme saccato thetato tathāgate anupalabbhiyamāne,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn730-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn730">2</a></sup></p>
<p>when a <em>tathāgata</em> is not to be found in truth and fact here in this very
life,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>leads to the inference that a <em>tathāgata</em> is not to be found in reality even
while he is alive, we were forced to conclude that the question ‘what happens to
the <em>tathāgata</em> after his death?’ is utterly meaningless.</p>
<p>It is also obvious from the conclusive statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>pubbe cāhaṁ etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi dukkhassa ca nirodhaṁ</em></p>
<p>formerly as well as now I make known just suffering and the cessation of
suffering</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that the Buddha, in answering this question, completely put aside such
conventional terms like ‘being’ and ‘person’, and solved the problem on the
basis of the four noble truths, which highlight the pure quintessence of the
Dhamma as it is.</p>
<p>We have to go a little deeper into this question of conventional terms like
‘being’ and ‘person’, because the statement that the <em>tathāgata</em> does not exist
in truth and fact is likely to drive fear into the minds of the generality of
people. In our last sermon, we gave a clue to an understanding of the sense in
which this statement is made, when we quoted an extraordinary new etymology, the
Buddha had advanced, for the term <em>satta</em> in the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe kho, Rādha, yo chando yo rāgo yā nandī yā taṇhā, tatra satto, tatra
visatto, tasmā ’satto’ti vuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn731-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn731">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Rādha, that desire, that lust, that delight, that craving in form with which
one is attached and thoroughly attached, therefore is one called a ‘being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha has punned on the word <em>satta</em>, to give a new orientation to its
meaning, that is, <em>rūpe satto visatto</em>, “attached and thoroughly attached to
form”.</p>
<p>From prehistoric times, the word <em>satta</em> was associated with the idea of some
primordial essence called <em>sat</em>, which carried with it notions of permanent
existence in the world. As derivatives from the present participle <em>sant</em> and
<em>sat</em>, we get the two words <em>satya</em> and <em>sattva</em> in Sanskrit. <em>Satya</em> means
‘truth’, or what is ‘true’. <em>Sattva</em> means a ‘being’ or the ‘state of being’. We
might even take <em>sattva</em> as the place from which there is a positive response or
an affirmation of a state of being.</p>
<p>Due to the semantic affinity between <em>satya</em>, ‘truth’, and <em>sattva</em>, ‘being’, an
absolute reality had been granted to the term <em>sattva</em> from ancient times.</p>
<p>But according to the new etymology advanced by the Buddha, the term <em>sattva</em> is
given only a relative reality within limits, that is to say, it is ‘real’ only
in a limited and a relative sense. The above quotation from the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em>
makes it clear that a being exists only so long as there is that desire, lust,
delight and craving in the five aggregates.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when there is no desire, or lust, or delight, or craving for any
of the five aggregates, there is no ‘being’. That is why we say that it is real
only in a limited and relative sense.</p>
<p>When a thing is dependent on another thing, it is relative and for that very
reason it has a limited applicability and is not absolute. Here, in this case,
the dependence is on desire or attachment. As long as there is desire or
attachment, there is a ‘being’, and when it is not there, there is no ‘being’.
So from this we can well infer that the <em>tathāgata</em> is not a ‘being’ by virtue
of the very definition he had given to the term <em>satta</em>.</p>
<p>The other day, we briefly quoted a certain simile from the <em>Rādhasutta</em> itself,
but could not explain it sufficiently. The Buddha gives this simile just after
advancing the above new definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose, Rādha, some little boys and girls are playing with sandcastles. So
long as their lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving for those things
have not gone away, they remain fond of them, they play with them, treat them
as their property and call them their own. But when, Rādha, those little boys
and girls have outgrown that lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving
for those sandcastles, they scatter them with their hands and feet, demolish
them, dismantle them and render them unplayable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we reflect upon the meaning of this simile from the point of view of
Dhamma, it seems that for those little boys and girls, sandcastles were real
things, as long as they had ignorance and craving with regard to them. When they
grew wiser and outgrew craving, those sandcastles became unreal. That is why
they destroyed them.</p>
<p>The untaught worldling is in a similar situation. So long as he is attached to
these five aggregates and has not comprehended their impermanent,
suffering-fraught and not-self nature, they are real for him. He is bound by his
own grasping.</p>
<p>The reality of the law of <em>kamma</em>, of merit and demerit, follows from that very
grasping. The dictum <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>, “dependent on grasping is
existence”, becomes meaningful in this context. There is an existence because
there is grasping. But at whatever point of time wisdom dawned and craving faded
away, all those things tend to become unreal and there is not even a ‘being’, as
there is no real ‘state of being’.</p>
<p>This mode of exposition receives support from the <em>Kaccāyanagottasutta</em> of the
<em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. The way the Buddha has defined right view in that discourse
is highly significant. We have already discussed this sutta on an earlier
occasion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn732-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn732">4</a></sup> Suffice it to remind ourselves of the basic maxim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Dukkham eva uppajjamānaṁ uppajjati, dukkhaṁ nirujjhamānaṁ nirujjhatī’ti na
kaṅkhati na vicikicchati aparappaccayā ñāṇam ev’ assa ettha hoti. Ettāvatā
kho, Kaccāyana, sammā diṭṭhi hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn733-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn733">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It is only suffering that arises and suffering that ceases. Understanding
thus, one does not doubt, one does not waver, and there is in him only the
knowledge that is not dependent on another. It is in so far, Kaccāyana, that
one has right view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is called <em>aparappaccayā ñāṇa</em> is that knowledge of realization by oneself
for which one is not dependent on another. The noble disciple wins to such a
knowledge of realization in regard to this fact, namely, that it is only a
question of suffering and its cessation.</p>
<p>The right view mentioned in this context is the supramundane right view, and not
that right view which takes <em>kamma</em> as one’s own, <em>kammassakatā sammā diṭṭhi</em>,
implying notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.</p>
<p>This supramundane right view brings out the norm of Dhamma as it is. Being
unable to understand this norm of Dhamma, contemporary ascetics and brahmins,
and even some monks themselves, accused the Buddha of being an annihilationist.
They brought up groundless allegations. There was also the opposite reaction of
seeking refuge in a form of eternalism, through fear of being branded as
annihilationists.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Buddha answered those wrong accusations in unmistakeable terms. We
come across such an instance in the <em>Alagaddūpama Sutta.</em> First of all the
Buddha qualifies the emancipated one in his dispensation with the terms <em>ariyo
pannaddhajo pannabhāro visaṁyutto</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn734-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn734">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Once the conceit ‘am’, <em>asmimāna</em>, is abandoned, this noble one is called
<em>pannaddhajo</em>, “one who has put down the flag of conceit”. He has ‘laid down the
burden’, <em>pannabhāro</em>, and is ‘disjoined’, <em>visaṁyutto</em>, from the fetters of
existence. About this emancipated one, he now makes the following declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ vimuttacittaṁ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṁ sa-indā devā sa-pajāpatikā
sa-brahmakā anvesaṁ nādhigacchanti: idaṁ nissitaṁ tathāgatassa viññāṇan’ti.
Taṁ kissa hetu? Diṭṭhe vāhaṁ, bhikkhave, dhamme tathāgato ananuvejjo’ti
vadāmi</em>.</p>
<p><em>Evaṁvādiṁ kho maṁ, bhikkhave, evam akkhāyiṁ eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā asatā tucchā
musā abhūtena abbhācikkhanti: venayiko samaṇo Gotamo, sato sattassa ucchedaṁ
vināsaṁ vibhavaṁ paññāpeti</em>.</p>
<p>A monk, thus released in mind, O! monks, gods including Indra, Pajāpati and
Brahmā, are unable to trace in their search to be able to say of him: ‘the
consciousness of this thus-gone-one is dependent on this’. And why is that so?
Monks, I say, even here and now the Tathāgata is not to be found.</p>
<p>When I say thus, when I teach thus, some recluses and brahmins wrongly and
falsely accuse me with the following unfounded allegation: ‘recluse Gotama is
an annihilationist, he lays down an annihilation, a destruction and
non-existence of a truly existing being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the <em>Anurādhasutta</em>, here too the Buddha concludes with the highly
significant statement of his stance, <em>pubbe cāhaṁ etarahi ca dukkhañceva
paññāpemi dukkhassa ca nirodhaṁ</em>, “formerly as well as now I make known just
suffering and the cessation of suffering”.</p>
<p>Though the statements in the suttas follow this trend, it seems that the
commentator himself was scared to bring out the correct position in his
commentary. The fact that he sets out with some trepidation is clear enough from
the way he tackles the term <em>tathāgata</em> in his commentary to the above discourse
in the <em>Majjhima Nikāya.</em> In commenting on the word <em>tathāgatassa</em> in the
relevant context, he makes the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tathāgatassā’ti ettha satto pi tathāgato’ti adhippeto, uttamapuggalo
khīṇāsavo pi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn735-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn735">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Tathāgata’s, herein, a being also is meant by the term <em>tathāgata</em>, as well as
the highest person, the influx-free <em>arahant</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as he gives two meanings to the word <em>tathāgata</em>, Venerable Buddhaghosa
attributes two meanings to the word <em>ananuvejjo</em> as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ananuvejjo’ti asaṁvijjamāno vā avindeyyo vā. Tathāgato’ti hi satte gahite
asaṁvijjamāno’ti attho vaṭṭati</em>, <em>khīṇāsave gahite avindeyyo’ti attho
vaṭṭati.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ananuvejjo</em> – ‘non-existing’ or ‘untraceable’. When by the word <em>tathāgata</em> a
being is meant, the sense ‘non existing’ is fitting; and when the influx-free
one is meant, the sense ‘untraceable’ is fitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to this exegesis, the term <em>tathāgata</em> in contexts where it means a
‘being’ is to be understood as non-existing, <em>asamvijjamāno</em>, which is
equivalent in sense to the expression <em>anupalabbhiyamāne</em>, discussed above.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the other sense attributed to it is <em>avindeyyo</em>, which
somehow grants the existence but suggests that it is ‘untraceable’. In other
words, the Tathāgata exists, but he cannot be traced or found out.</p>
<p>The commentator opines that the term in question has to be understood in two
different senses, according to contexts. In order to substantiate his view, the
commentator attributes the following apocryphal explanation to the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhikkhave, ahaṁ diṭṭheva dhamme dharamānakaṁ yeva khīṇāsavaṁ viññāṇavasena
indādīhi avindiyaṁ vadāmi. Na hi sa-indā devā sabrahmakā sapajāpatikā
anvesantāpi khīṇāsavassa vipassanācittaṁ vā maggacittaṁ vā phalacittaṁ vā,
idaṁ nāma ārammaṇaṁ nissāya vattatī’ti jānituṁ sakkonti. Te appaṭisandhikassa
parinibbutassa kiṁ jānissanti?</em></p>
<p>Monks, I say that even here and now the influx-free one, while he is alive, is
untraceable by Indra and others in regard to his consciousness. Gods,
including Indra, Brahmā and Pajāpati are indeed unable in their search to
find out either the insight consciousness, or the path consciousness, or the
fruition consciousness, to be able to say: ‘it is dependent on this object’.
How then could they find out the consciousness of one who has attained
<em>parinibbāna</em> with no possibility of conception?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably, the argument is that, since the consciousness of the <em>arahant</em> is
untraceable by the gods while he is alive, it is all the more difficult for them
to find it out when he has attained <em>parinibbāna</em>. That is to say, the <em>arahant</em>
somehow exists, even after his <em>parinibbāna</em>, only that he cannot be traced.</p>
<p>It is obvious from this commentarial trend that the commentator finds himself on
the horns of a dilemma, because of his inability to grasp an extremely deep
dimension of linguistic usage. The Buddha’s forceful and candid declaration was
too much for him. Probably, he demurred out of excessive faith, but his stance
is not in accordance with the Dhamma. It falls short of right view.</p>
<p>Let us now recapitulate the correct position in the light of the above sutta
passage. The Buddha declares at the very outset that the emancipated monk
undergoes a significant change by virtue of the fact that he has abandoned the
conceit ‘am’. That Tathāgata, that emancipated monk, who has put down the flag
of conceit, laid down the burden of the five aggregates, and won release from
the fetters to existence, defies definition and eludes categorization. Why is
that?</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier, the word <em>asmi</em> constitutes the very basis of the
entire grammatical structure.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn736-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn736">8</a></sup> <em>Asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is the basic peg, which
stands for the first person. The second person and the third person come later.</p>
<p>So <em>asmi</em> is basic to the grammatical structure. When this basic peg is
uprooted, the emancipated monk reaches that state of freedom from the vortex.
There is no dichotomy to sustain a vortex, no two teams to keep up the vortical
interplay. Where there is no turning round, there is no room for designation,
and this is the implication of the phrase <em>vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi paññāpanāya</em>,
which we happened to quote on a previous occasion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn737-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn737">9</a></sup> For the <em>arahants</em>
there is no vortex whereby to designate.</p>
<p>That is why the Tathāgata, in this very life, is said to have transcended the
state of a ‘being’. Only as a way of speaking in terms of worldly parlance one
cannot help referring to him as a ‘being’. But in truth and fact, his position
is otherwise.</p>
<p>Going by worldly usage, one might indiscriminately think of applying the four
propositions of the tetralemma to the Tathāgata as well. But it is precisely in
this context that the questioner’s presumptions are fully exposed.</p>
<p>The fact that he has misconceived the implications of the terms <em>satta</em> and
Tathāgata is best revealed by the very question whether the Tathāgata exists
after his death. It shows that he presumes the Tathāgata to be existing in truth
and fact, and if so, he has either to go on existing or be annihilated after
death. Here, then, we have an extremely deep dimension of linguistic usage.</p>
<p>The commentary says that gods and Brahmās cannot find the Tathāgata in point of
his consciousness. The Tathāgata defies definition due to his abandonment of
proliferations of cravings, conceits and views. Cravings, conceits and views,
which bring in attachments, bindings and entanglements to justify the usage of
terms like <em>satta</em>, ‘being’, and <em>puggala</em>, ‘person’, are extinct in the
Tathāgata. That is why he is beyond reckoning.</p>
<p>In the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> the Buddha makes the following
declaration about himself, after refuting the sixty-two views, catching them all
in one super-net.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ucchinnabhavanettiko, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa kāyo tiṭṭhati. Yav’assa kāyo
ṭhassati tāva naṁ dakkhinti devamanussā. Kāyassa bhedā uddhaṁ jīvitapariyādānā
na naṁ dakkhinti devamanussā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn738-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn738">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, the Tathāgata’s body stands with its leading factor in becoming cut off
at the root. As long as his body stands, gods and men will see him. With the
breaking up of his body, after the extinction of his life, gods and men will
not see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he follows up this promulgation with a simile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathā pi, bhikkhave, ambapiṇḍiyā vaṇṭacchinnāya yāni kānici ambāni
vaṇṭūpanibandhanāni, sabbāni tāni tad anvayāni bhavanti, evam eva kho,
bhikkhave, ucchinnabhavanettiko tathāgatassa kāyo tiṭṭhati. Yav’assa kāyo
ṭhassati tāva naṁ dakkhinti devamanussā. Kāyassa bhedā uddhaṁ jīvitapariyādānā
na naṁ dakkhinti devamanussā.</em></p>
<p>Just as, monks, in the case of a bunch of mangoes, when its stalk is cut off,
whatever mangoes that were connected with the stalk would all of them be
likewise cut off, even so, monks, stands the Tathāgata’s body with its leading
factor in becoming cut off at the root. As long as his body stands, gods and
men will see him. With the breaking up of his body, after the extinction of
his life, gods and men will not see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simile employed serves to bring out the fact that the Tathāgata’s body
stands with its leading factor in becoming eradicated. Here it is said that gods
and men see the Tathāgata while he is alive. But the implications of this
statement should be understood within the context of the similes given.</p>
<p>The reference here is to a tree uprooted, one that simply stands cut off at the
root. In regard to each aggregate of the Buddha and other emancipated ones, it
is clearly stated that it is cut off at the root, <em>ucchinnamūlo</em>, that it is
like a palm tree divested of its site <em>tālāvatthukato</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn739-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn739">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In the case of a palm tree, deprived of its natural site but still left
standing, anyone seeing it from afar would mistake it for an actual tree that is
growing. It is the same idea that emerges from the simile of the bunch of
mangoes. The Tathāgata is comparable to a bunch of mangoes with its stalk cut
off.</p>
<p>What then is meant by the statement that gods and men see him? Their seeing is
limited to the seeing of his body. For many, the concept of seeing the Tathāgata
is just this seeing of his physical body. Of course, we do not find in this
discourse any prediction that we can see him after five-thousand years.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, here we seem to have some deep idea underlying this
discourse. An extremely important clue to a correct understanding of this
Dhamma, one that helps to straighten up right view, lies beneath this problem of
the Buddha’s refusal to answer the tetralemma concerning the Tathāgata. This
fact comes to light in the <em>Yamakasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>.</p>
<p>A monk named Yamaka conceived the evil view, the distorted view,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi, yathā khīṇāsavo bhikkhu kāyassa
bhedā ucchijjati vinassati, na hoti paraṁ maraṇā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn740-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn740">12</a></sup></p>
<p>As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Exalted One, an influx-free monk,
with the breaking up of his body, is annihilated and perishes, he does not
exist after death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went about saying that the Buddha had declared that the emancipated monk is
annihilated at death. Other monks, on hearing this, tried their best to dispel
his wrong view, saying that the Buddha had never declared so, but it was in
vain. At last they approached Venerable Sāriputta and begged him to handle the
situation.</p>
<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta came there, and after ascertaining the fact, proceeded
to dispel Venerable Yamaka’s wrong view by getting him to answer a series of
questions. The first set of questions happened to be identical with the one the
Buddha had put forward in Venerable Anurādha’s case, namely a catechism on the
three characteristics. We have already quoted it step by step, for facility of
understanding.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn741-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn741">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Suffice it to mention, in brief, that it served to convince Venerable Yamaka of
the fact that whatever is impermanent, suffering and subject to change, is not
fit to be looked upon as ‘this is mine, this am I, and this is my self’.</p>
<p>The first step, therefore, consisted in emphasizing the not self characteristic
through a catechism on the three signata. The next step was to get Venerable
Yamaka to reflect on this not self characteristic in eleven ways, according to
the standard formula.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, āvuso Yamaka, yaṁ kiñci rūpaṁ atītānāgatapaccuppannaṁ ajjhattaṁ vā
bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṁ va sukhumaṁ vā hīnaṁ vā panītaṁ vā yaṁ dūre santike vā,
sabbaṁ rūpaṁ netaṁ mama neso ’ham asmi, na me so attā’ti evam etaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ sammāpaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ. Ya kāci vedanā … ya kāci saññā … ye
keci saṅkhāra … yaṁ kiñci viññāṇaṁ atītānāgatapaccuppannaṁ ajjhattaṁ vā
bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṁ va sukhumaṁ vā hīnaṁ vā panītaṁ vā yaṁ dūre santike vā,
sabbaṁ viññāṇaṁ netaṁ mama neso ’ham asmi, na me so attā’ti evam etaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ sammāpaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ passaṁ, āvuso Yamaka, sutavā ariyasāvako rūpasmiṁ nibbindati, vedanāya
nibbindati, saññāya nibbindati, saṅkhāresu nibbindati, viññāṇasmiṁ nibbindati.
Nibbindam virajjati, virāgā vimuccati, vimuttasmiṁ vimuttam iti ñāṇaṁ hoti.
Khīṇā jāti vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ nāparaṁ itthattāyā’ti
pajānāti.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, friend Yamaka, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or
near, all form must be seen as it really is with right wisdom thus: ‘this is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’. Any kind of feeling whatsoever
… any kind of perception whatsoever … any kind of preparations whatsoever
… any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all
consciousness must be seen as it really is with right wisdom thus: ‘this is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’.</p>
<p>Seeing thus, friend Yamaka, the instructed noble disciple gets disgusted of
form, gets disgusted of feeling, gets disgusted of perception, gets disgusted
of preparations, gets disgusted of consciousness. Being disgusted, he becomes
dispassionate, through dispassion his mind is liberated. When it is liberated,
there comes the knowledge ‘it is liberated’ and he understands: ‘extinct is
birth, lived is the holy life, done is what had to be done, there is no more
of this state of being’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the third step in his interrogation of Venerable Yamaka, Venerable Sāriputta
poses the same questions which the Buddha addressed to Venerable Anurādha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?” “No,
friend.” “Do you regard feeling … perception … preparations …
consciousness as the Tathāgata?” “No, friend.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?”
“No, friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?” “No, friend.”
“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling?” “No, friend.” “Do you regard the
Tathāgata as apart from feeling?” “No, friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata
as in perception?” “No, friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from
perception?” “No, friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata as in preparations?”
“No, friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from preparations?” “No,
friend.” “Do you regard the Tathāgata as in consciousness?” “No, friend.” “Do
you regard the Tathāgata as apart from consciousness?” “No, friend.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form, feeling, perception,
preparations and consciousness as constituting the Tathāgata?” “No, friend.”
“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is
devoid of form, feeling, perception, preparations and consciousness?” “No,
friend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was at this juncture that Venerable Sāriputta puts this conclusive question
to Venerable Yamaka in order to drive the crucial point home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But then, friend Yamaka, now that for you a Tathāgata is not to be found in
truth and fact here in this very life, is it proper for you to declare: ‘As I
understand Dhamma taught by the Exalted One, an influx-free monk is
annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and does not exist after
death’?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At last, Venerable Yamaka confesses,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Formerly, friend Sāriputta, I did hold that evil view, ignorant as I was. But
now that I have heard this Dhamma sermon of the Venerable Sāriputta, I have
given up that evil view and have gained an understanding of the Dhamma.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if to get a confirmation of Venerable Yamaka’s present stance, Venerable
Sāriputta continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If, friend Yamaka, they were to ask you the question: ‘Friend Yamaka, as to
that monk, the influx-free <em>arahant</em>, what happens to him with the breaking up
of the body after death?’ Being asked thus, what would you answer?”</p>
<p>“If they were to ask me that question, friend Sāriputta, I would answer in
this way: Friends, form is impermanent, what is impermanent is suffering, what
is suffering has ceased and passed away. Feeling … perception …
preparations … consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is
suffering, what is suffering has ceased and passed away. Thus questioned, I
would answer in such a way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be it noted that, in this conclusive answer, there is no mention whatsoever of a
Tathāgata, a <em>satta</em>, or a <em>puggala</em>.</p>
<p>Now at this reply, Venerable Sāriputta expresses his approbation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good, good, friend Yamaka, well then, friend Yamaka, I will bring up a simile
for you that you may grasp this meaning all the more clearly.</p>
<p>Suppose, friend Yamaka, there was a householder or a householder’s son,
prosperous, with much wealth and property, protected by a bodyguard. Then some
man would come by who wished to ruin him, to harm him, to imperil him, to
deprive him of life. And it would occur to that man: ‘This householder or a
householder’s son is prosperous, with much wealth and property, he has his
bodyguard, it is not easy to deprive him of his life by force. What if I were
to get close to him and take his life?’</p>
<p>Then he would approach that householder or householder’s son and say to him:
‘Would you take me on as a servant, sir?’ Then the householder or
householder’s son would take him on as a servant. The man would serve him,
rising up before him, going to bed after him, being at his beck and call,
pleasing in his conduct, endearing in his speech. The householder or
householder’s son would regard him as a friend, an intimate friend, and would
place trust in him. But once the man has ascertained that the householder or
householder’s son has trust in him, he waits for an opportunity to find him
alone and kills him with a sharp knife.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is the simile. Based on this deep simile, Venerable Sāriputta puts the
following questions to Venerable Yamaka to see whether he has grasped the moral
behind it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you think, friend Yamaka, when that man approached that householder
or householder’s son and said to him ‘would you take me on as a servant,
sir?’, wasn’t he a murderer even then, though the householder or householder’s
son did not know him as ‘my murderer’? And when the man was serving him,
rising up before him and going to bed after him, being at his beck and call,
pleasing in his conduct and endearing in his speech, wasn’t he a murderer then
too, though the householder or householder’s son did not know him as ‘my
murderer’? And when the man, finding him alone, took his life with a sharp
knife, wasn’t he a murderer then too, though the other did not know him as ‘my
murderer’?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Yamaka answers “Yes, friend”, by way of assent to all these
matter-of-fact questions.</p>
<p>It was then, that Venerable Sāriputta comes out with the full significance of
this simile, portraying the uninstructed worldling in the same light as that
naively unsuspecting and ignorant householder or householder’s son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So too, friend Yamaka, the uninstructed worldling, who has no regard for the
noble ones, and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no
regard for good men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma,
regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self
as in form. He regards feeling as self … perception as self … preparations
as self … consciousness as self …</p>
<p>He does not understand, as it really is, impermanent form as ‘impermanent
form’, impermanent feeling as ‘impermanent feeling’, impermanent perception as
‘impermanent perception’, impermanent preparations as ‘impermanent
preparations’, impermanent consciousness as ‘impermanent consciousness’.</p>
<p>He does not understand, as it really is, painful form as ‘painful form’,
painful feeling as ‘painful feeling’, painful perception as ‘painful
perception’, painful preparations as ‘painful preparations’, painful
consciousness as ‘painful consciousness’.</p>
<p>He does not understand, as it really is, selfless form as ‘selfless form’,
selfless feeling as ‘selfless feeling’, selfless perception as ‘selfless
perception’, selfless preparations as ‘selfless preparations’, selfless
consciousness as ‘selfless consciousness’.</p>
<p>He does not understand, as it really is, prepared form as ‘prepared form’,
prepared feeling as ‘prepared feeling’, prepared perception as ‘prepared
perception’, prepared preparations as ‘prepared preparations’, prepared
consciousness as ‘prepared consciousness’.</p>
<p>He does not understand, as it really is, murderous form as ‘murderous form’,
murderous feeling as ‘murderous feeling’, murderous perception as ‘murderous
perception’, murderous preparations as ‘murderous preparations’, murderous
consciousness as ‘murderous consciousness’.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, is what the attitude of the uninstructed worldling amounts to.
Venerable Sāriputta now goes on to describe the consequences of such an attitude
for the worldling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So rūpaṁ upeti upādiyati adhiṭṭhāti attā me’ti, vedanaṁ … saññaṁ …
saṅkhāre … viññāṇaṁ upeti upādiyati adhiṭṭhāti attā me’ti. Tassime
pañcupādānakkhandhā upetā upādiṇṇā dīgharattaṁ ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattanti.</em></p>
<p>“He becomes committed to form, grasps it and takes a stand upon it as ‘my
self’. He becomes committed to feeling … to perception … to preparations
… to consciousness, grasps it and takes a stand upon it as ‘my self’. These
five aggregates of grasping, to which he becomes committed, and which he
grasps, lead to his harm and suffering for a long time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta contrasts it with the standpoint of the instructed
disciple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But, friend, the instructed noble disciple, who has regard for the noble
ones, who is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for good
men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as
self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He
does not regard feeling as self … perception as self … preparations as
self … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.</p>
<p>He understands, as it really is, impermanent form as ‘impermanent form’,
impermanent feeling as ‘impermanent feeling’, impermanent perception as
‘impermanent perception’, impermanent preparations as ‘impermanent
preparations’, impermanent consciousness as ‘impermanent consciousness’.</p>
<p>He understands, as it really is, painful form as ‘painful form’, painful
feeling as ‘painful feeling’, painful perception as ‘painful perception’,
painful preparations as ‘painful preparations’, painful consciousness as
‘painful consciousness’.</p>
<p>He understands, as it really is, selfless form as ‘selfless form’, selfless
feeling as ‘selfless feeling’, selfless perception as ‘selfless perception’,
selfless preparations as ‘selfless preparations’, selfless consciousness as
‘selfless consciousness’.</p>
<p>He understands, as it really is, prepared form as ‘prepared form’, prepared
feeling as ‘prepared feeling’, prepared perception as ‘prepared perception’,
prepared preparations as ‘prepared preparations’, prepared consciousness as
‘prepared consciousness’.</p>
<p>He understands, as it really is, murderous form as ‘murderous form’, murderous
feeling as ‘murderous feeling’, murderous perception as ‘murderous
perception’, murderous preparations as ‘murderous preparations’, murderous
consciousness as ‘murderous consciousness’.“</p>
<p>He does not become committed to form, does not grasp it, does not take a stand
upon it as ‘my self’. He does not become committed to feeling … to
perception … to preparations … to consciousness, does not grasp it, does
not take a stand upon it as ‘my self’. These five aggregates of grasping, to
which he does not become committed, which he does not grasp, lead to his
welfare and happiness for a long time.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Venerable Sāriputta wanted to prove, was the fact that everyone of the five
aggregates is a murderer, though the worldlings, ignorant of the true state of
affairs, pride themselves on each of them, saying “this is mine, this am I and
this is my self”. As the grand finale of this instructive discourse comes the
following wonderful declaration by Venerable Yamaka.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Such things do happen, friend Sāriputta, to those venerable ones who have
sympathetic and benevolent fellow monks in the holy life, like you, to
admonish and instruct, so much so that, on hearing this Dhamma sermon of the
Venerable Sāriputta, my mind is liberated from the influxes by non-grasping.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might sound extremely strange in this age of scepticism regarding such
intrinsic qualities of the Dhamma like <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, ‘visible here and now’,
<em>akālika</em>, ‘timeless’, and <em>ehipassika</em>, ‘inviting to come and see’. But all the
same we have to grant the fact that this discourse, which begins with a
Venerable Yamaka who is bigoted with such a virulent evil view, which even his
fellow monks found it difficult to dispel, concludes, as we saw, with this grand
finale of a Venerable Yamaka joyfully declaring his attainment of <em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>This episode bears testimony to the fact that the tetralemma concerning the
Tathāgata’s after-death state has beneath it an extremely valuable criterion,
proper to this Dhamma. There are some who are even scared to discuss this topic,
perhaps due to unbalanced faith – faith unwarranted by wisdom. The tetralemma,
however, reveals on analysis a wealth of valuable Dhamma material that goes to
purify one’s right view. That is why the Venerable Yamaka ended up as an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>So this discourse, also, is further proof of the fact that the Buddha’s solution
to the problem of the indeterminate points actually took the form of a
disquisition on voidness. Such expositions fall into the category called
<em>suññatapaṭisaṁyuttā suttantā</em>, “discourses dealing with voidness”. This
category of discourses avoids the conventional worldly usages, such as <em>satta</em>,
‘being’, and <em>puggala</em>, ‘person’, and highlights the teachings on the four noble
truths, which bring out the nature of things ‘as they are’.</p>
<p>Generally, such discourses instil fear into the minds of worldlings, so much so
that even during the Buddha’s time there were those recorded instances of
misconstruing and misinterpretation. It is in this light that we have to
appreciate the Buddha’s prediction that in the future there will be monks who
would not like to listen or lend ear to those deep and profound discourses of
the Buddha, pertaining to the supramundane and dealing with the void.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puna ca paraṁ, bhikkhave, bhavissanti bhikkhū anāgatamaddhānaṁ abhāvitakāya
abhāvitasīlā abhāvitacittā abhāvitapaññā, te abhāvitakāyā samānā abhāvitasīlā
abhāvitacittā abhāvitapaññā ye te suttantā tathāgatabhāsitā gambhīrā
gambhīratthā lokuttarā suññatāpaṭisaṁyuttā, tesu bhaññamānesu na sussūsanti,
na sotaṁ odahissanti, na aññācittaṁ upaṭṭhapessanti, na ca te dhamme
uggahetabbaṁ pariyāpuṇitabbaṁ maññissanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn742-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn742">14</a></sup></p>
<p>And moreover, monks, there will be in the future those monks who, being
undeveloped in bodily conduct, being undeveloped in morality, being
undeveloped in concentration, being undeveloped in wisdom, would not like to
listen, to lend ear or to make an attempt to understand and deem it fit to
learn when those discourses preached by the Tathāgata, which are deep,
profound in meaning, supramundane and dealing with the void, are being
recited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to an extremely deep dimension of this Dhamma. By way of
clarification, we may allude to a kind of exorcism practiced by some traditional
devil dancers. At the end of an all-night session of devil dancing, the
mediating priest goes round, exorcising the spirits from the house with fistfuls
of a highly inflammable incense powder. Blazing flames arise, as he sprinkles
that powder onto the lighted torch, directing the flames at every nook and
corner of the house. Some onlookers even get scared that he is trying to set the
house on fire. But actually no harm is done.</p>
<p>Well, the Buddha, too, as the mediating priest of the three realms, had to
conduct a similar exorcising ritual over linguistic conventions, aiming at some
words in particular. It is true that he made use of conventional language in
order to convey his teaching. But his Dhamma proper was one that transcended
logic, <em>atakkāvacaro</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn743-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn743">15</a></sup></p>
<p>It happened to be a Dhamma that soared well above the limitations of grammar and
logic, and analytically exposed their very structure. The marvel of the Dhamma
is in its very inaccessibility to logic. That is why it defied the four-cornered
logic of the tetralemma. It refused to be cornered and went beyond the concepts
of a ‘being’ or a ‘self’. The <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex was breached and concepts
themselves were transcended.</p>
<p>Now this is the exorcism the Buddha had to carry out. He smoked out the term
<em>attā</em>, ‘self’, so dear to the whole world. Of course, he could not help making
use of that word as such. In fact there is an entire chapter in the <em>Dhammapada</em>
entitled <em>Attavagga</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn744-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn744">16</a></sup> But it must be emphasized that the term in that
context does not refer to a permanent self. It stands for ‘oneself’. Some who
mistakenly rendered it as ‘self’, ended up in difficulties. Take for instance
the following verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attā hi attano nātho,</em> <br />
<em>ko hi nātho paro siyā,</em> <br />
<em>attanā hi sudantena,</em> <br />
<em>nāthaṁ labhati dullabhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn745-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn745">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Oneself, indeed, is one’s own saviour, <br />
What other saviour could there be? <br />
Even in oneself, disciplined well, <br />
One finds that saviour, so hard to find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who render the above verse literally, with a self-bias, would get stuck
when confronted with the following verse in the <em>Bālavagga</em>, the “chapter of the
fool”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puttā m’atthi, dhanam m’atthi,</em> <br />
<em>iti bālo vihaññati,</em> <br />
<em>attā hi attano natthi,</em> <br />
<em>kuto puttā, kuto dhanaṁ?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn746-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn746">18</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Sons I have, wealth I have’, <br />
So the fool is vexed, <br />
Even oneself is not one’s own, <br />
Where then are sons, where is wealth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas the former verse says <em>attā hi attano nātho</em>, here we find the statement
<em>attā hi attano natthi</em>. If one ignores the reflexive sense and translates the
former line with something like “self is the lord of self”, one will be at a
loss to translate the seemingly contradictory statement “even self is not owned
by self”.</p>
<p>At times, the Buddha had to be incisive in regard to some words, which the
worldlings are prone to misunderstand and misinterpret. We have already
discussed at length the significance of such terms as <em>satta</em> and <em>tathāgata</em>,
with reference to their etymological background. <em>Sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, or
‘personality view’, masquerades even behind the term <em>tathāgata</em>, and that is
why they raise such ill-founded questions. That is also why one is averse to
penetrate into the meanings of these deep discourses.</p>
<p>Like the term <em>tathāgata</em>, the term <em>loka</em> also had insinuations of a self-bias.
The Buddha, as we saw, performed the same ritual of exorcism to smoke out those
insinuations. His definition of the ‘world’ with reference to the six
sense-bases is a corrective to that erroneous concept.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn747-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn747">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the indeterminate points, too, we find questions relating to the nature of
the world, such as <em>sassato loko – asassato loko</em>, “the world is eternal – the
world is not eternal”, and <em>antavā loko – anantavā loko</em>, “the world is finite –
the world is infinite”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn748-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn748">20</a></sup> In all such contexts, the questioner had the
prejudice of the conventional concept of the world. The commentaries refer to it
as <em>cakkavāḷaloka</em>, the common concept of ‘world system’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn749-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn749">21</a></sup> But the Buddha
advanced a profound definition of the concept of the world with reference to the
six bases of sense-contact.</p>
<p>In this connection, we come across a highly significant discourse in the
<em>Saḷāyatanavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. There we find the Buddha making the
following declaration to the monks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, gamanena lokassa antaṁ ñātayyaṁ, daṭṭhayyaṁ, patteyyan’ti
vadāmi. Na ca panāhaṁ, bhikkhave, appatvā lokassa antaṁ dukkhassa antakiriyaṁ
vadāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn750-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn750">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I do not say that by travelling one can come to know or see or reach
the end of the world. Nor do I say that without reaching the end of the world
one can put an end to suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this riddle-like pronouncement, the Buddha gets up and retires to the
monastery. We came across this kind of problematic situation earlier too. Most
probably this is a device of the Buddha as the teacher to give his disciples an
opportunity to train in the art of analytical exposition of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>After the Buddha had left, those monks, perplexed by this terse and tantalizing
declaration, approached Venerable Ānanda and begged him to expound its meaning
at length. With some modest hesitation, as usual, Venerable Ānanda agreed and
came out with the way he himself understood the significance of the Buddha’s
declaration in the following words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, ayaṁ vuccati ariyassa
vinaye loko. Kena c’āvuso lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī?</em></p>
<p><em>Cakkhunā kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, sotena … ghānena …
jivhāya … kāyena … manena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī.
Yena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, ayaṁ vuccati ariyassa
vinaye loko.</em></p>
<p>Friends, that by which one has a perception of the world and a conceit of the
world, that in this discipline of the noble ones is called ‘the world’. By
what, friends, has one a perception of the world and a conceit of the world?</p>
<p>By the eye, friends, one has a perception of the world and a conceit of the
world, by the ear … by the nose … by the tongue … by the body … by the
mind, friends one has a perception of the world and a conceit of the world.
That, friends, by which one has a perception of the world and a conceit of the
world, that in this discipline of the noble ones is called ‘the world’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems, then, that the definition of the world in the discipline of the noble
ones is one that accords with radical attention, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, whereas
the concept of the world as upheld in those indeterminate points is born of
wrong attention, <em>ayoniso manasikāra</em>.</p>
<p>In the present age, too, scientists, when they speak of an ‘end of the world’,
entertain presumptions based on wrong attention.</p>
<p>When those monks who listened to Venerable Ānanda’s exposition reported it to
the Buddha, he fully endorsed it. This definition, therefore, is as authentic as
the word of the Buddha himself and conclusive enough. It is on the basis of the
six sense-bases that the world has a perception of the ‘world’ and a conceit of
the ‘world’.</p>
<p>The conceit here meant is not pride as such, but the measuring characteristic of
worldly concepts. For instance, there is this basic scale of measuring length:
The inch, the span, the foot, the cubit and the fathom. These measurements
presuppose this body to be a measuring rod.</p>
<p>In fact, all scales of measurement, in some way or other, relate to one or the
other of the six sense-bases. That is why the above definition of the world is
on the side of radical attention.</p>
<p>The worldling’s concept of the world, conventionally so called, is the product
of wrong or non-radical attention. It is unreal to the extent that it is founded
on the notion of the compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>. The existence of the world, as a
whole, follows the norm of arising and ceasing. It is by ignoring this norm that
the notion of the compact receives acceptance.</p>
<p>Two persons are watching a magic kettle on display at a science exhibition.
Water is endlessly flowing from the magic kettle to a basin. One is waiting
until the kettle gets empty, while the other waits to see the basin overflowing.
Neither of their wishes is fulfilled. Why? Because a hidden tube conducts the
water in the basin back again to the kettle. So the magic kettle never gets
emptied and the basin never overflows. This is the secret of the magic kettle.</p>
<p>The world also is such a magic kettle. Gigantic world systems contract and
expand in cyclic fashion. In the ancient term for world systems, <em>cakkavāḷa</em>,
this cyclic nature is already insinuated. Taken in a broader sense, the
existence or continuity of the world is cyclic, as indicated by the two terms
<em>saṁvaṭṭa</em> and <em>vivaṭṭa</em>, ‘contraction’ and ‘expansion’. In both these terms,
the significant word <em>vaṭṭa</em>, suggestive of ‘turning round’, is seen to occur.
It is as good as saying ‘rise and fall’, <em>udayabbaya</em>.</p>
<p>When one world system gets destroyed, another world system gets crystallized, as
it were. We hear of Brahmā mansions emerging.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn751-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn751">23</a></sup> So the existence of the
world is a continuous process of arising and ceasing. It is in a cycle. How can
one find a point of beginning in a cycle? Can one speak of it as ‘eternal’ or
‘non-eternal’? The question as a whole is fallacious.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Buddha’s definition of the term <em>loka</em>, based on the
etymology <em>lujjati</em>, <em>palujjatī’ti loko</em>, is quite apt and meaningful.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn752-1"><a href="sermon-22.html#fn-fn752">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The world is all the time in a process of disintegration. It is by ignoring this
disintegrating nature and by overemphasizing the arising aspect that the
ordinary uninstructed worldling speaks of a ‘world’ as it is conventionally
understood. The world is afflicted by this process of arising and passing away
in every moment of its existence.</p>
<p>It is to be found in our breathing, too. Our entire body vibrates to the rhythm
of this rise and fall. That is why the Buddha offered us a redefinition of the
world. According to the terminology of the noble ones, the world is to be
redefined with reference to the six bases of sense-contact. This includes mind
and mind-objects as well. In fact, the range of the six bases of sense-contact
is all comprehending. Nothing falls outside of it.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twentythird sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The other day, we brought up quotations to prove that Nibbāna, as the cessation
of becoming, carries no implications of a nihilist or annihilationist view
because the Tathāgata has transcended the concept of a being.</p>
<p>It became evident, from those quotations, that to assert with an eternalist
bias, the proposition that the Tathāgata exists after death, simply because he
is referred to as a being, or a person, in the discourses, is contrary to the
spirit of the Dhamma. The fact that the <em>arahant</em>, who has done away with the
latencies to conceits of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, still continues to use even the words
‘I’ and ‘mine’, only as a concession to worldly conventions and common parlance,
came to light from the <em>Arahantasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, quoted on an
earlier occasion.</p>
<p>To remind ourselves of the relevant section of that quotation, we may hark back
to the following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Ahaṁ vadāmī’ti pi so vadeyya,</em> <br />
<em>’Mamaṁ vadantī’ti pi so vadeyya,</em> <br />
<em>Loke samaññaṁ kusalo viditvā,</em> <br />
<em>Vohāramattena so vohareyya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn754-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn754">2</a></sup></p>
<p>He might still say: ‘I speak’, <br />
He might also say: ‘They speak to me’, <br />
Being skilful in knowing the worldly parlance, <br />
He uses such terms merely as a convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The philosophy of voidness that emerges from those discourses which declare that
in reality there is no Tathāgata, we compared to the blazing flames arising from
the fistfuls of a highly inflammable incense powder at the end of an all-night’s
ceremony of devil dancing. Generally this fire ordeal is horrifying to the
onlookers. The Buddha also had to stage a similar fire ordeal in the
<em>Dhammayāga</em>, or the ‘Dhamma-sacrifice’, he administered to exorcize the
malignant personality view, <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, ingrained in the minds of
worldlings.</p>
<p>Of course there is no explicit reference to such a fire ordeal in the
discourses. However, we do come across a word somewhat suggestive of this kind
of exorcism. The word <em>vidhūpeti</em>, derived from the word <em>dhūpa</em>, ‘incense’, is
suggestive of ‘fumigating’ or ‘smoking out’. For instance, we find the following
verse in the <em>Bodhivagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em> with reference to the stages of
reflection on the law of dependent arising, in direct and reverse order, that
the Buddha had gone through just after his enlightenment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yadā have pātubhavanti dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>Ātāpino jhāyato brāhmaṇassa,</em> <br />
<em>Vidhūpayaṁ tiṭṭhati Mārasenaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>Suriyo ’va obhāsayam antalikkhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn755-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn755">3</a></sup></p>
<p>When <em>dhammas</em> manifest themselves, <br />
To the resolutely meditating Brahmin, <br />
He stands fumigating the hordes of Māra, <br />
Like the sun irradiating the firmament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dispelling of the hordes of Māra is rather suggestive of a smoking out. In
some other discourses, this verb <em>vidhūpeti</em> is found contrasted with
<em>sandhūpeti</em>. The meaning of both these verbs, which have the <em>dhūpa</em> element in
common, is not quite clear. It is likely that the two words imply two functions
of the ritual associated with incense. While some fragrant kinds of incense are
used for propitiating benevolent spirits, certain caustic types are utilized for
exorcising evil spirits.</p>
<p>For instance in the <em>Khajjanīyasutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, with reference
to the noble disciple, the phrase <em>vidhūpeti na sandhūpeti</em> occurs.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn756-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn756">4</a></sup>
Since the implicit reference is again to the hordes of Māra, the phrase could be
rendered as “he exorcises and does not propitiate”.</p>
<p>The ordinary worldling’s mode of recognition of the Tathāgata is comparable to
the recognition of a vortex that has already ceased with the help of the flotsam
and jetsam lightly floating around it. Even after the vortex has ceased, flotsam
and jetsam could still go on rotating, giving the wrong impression that the
vortex is still there.</p>
<p>If one understands that the vortex has actually ceased deep down at its centre,
and that what remains there, now, is the great ocean, undifferentiated and
unique, one can get rid of the unfounded fear arising from the statement that
there is no Tathāgata in truth and fact.</p>
<p>The cessation of the puny centre of the whirlpool is equivalent to inheriting an
expansive great ocean. It is where a vortex ceases that the great ocean prevails
unhindered. To give up the limitations of a vortex, is to inherit the limitless
ocean.</p>
<p>The irony arising from these statements is already implicit in the term
<em>arahant</em>. We use this term with reference to the Buddha as well as the
<em>arahants</em>. Though the commentators later attributed various other meanings to
the term, the basic sense is ‘to be worthy of gifts’. In fact, it is being
worthy of receiving everything.</p>
<p><strong>It is by giving up all that one becomes worthy of all.</strong></p>
<p>Here too, we have a paradox. To become an <em>arahant</em> is to let go of everything.
Craving has to be fully abandoned. It is when all desires are gone, when
everything is given up, that one becomes worthy of receiving everything. This is
the deeper side of the significance of the term <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>There are six modes of measuring in accordance with the conceit ‘am’,
<em>asmimāna</em>. What is known as <em>saḷāyatana</em>, or the six sense-bases, comprise the
six scales of measurement, asserting the conceit ‘am’. At whatever point of time
the measuring, evaluating and assessing done by the six sense-bases, such as the
eye, ear, nose etc., ceases, the person concerned thereby becomes immeasurable,
invaluable and boundless. It is here that the simile of the vortex and the ocean
becomes meaningful. So the only way of becoming immeasurable and boundless is to
abandon all those scales of measurement. This might sound extremely strange.</p>
<p>With the cessation of a vortex, the attention of one who has been looking at it
turns towards the depth, immeasurability and boundlessness of the great ocean.
This line of reflection might even enable one to get a glimpse of an unworldly
beauty in this philosophy of the void, which drives an unfounded fear into the
minds of the worldlings.</p>
<p>We do get positive proof of this fact in such sections of the <em>Dhammapada</em> as
those entitled The Flowers, The Worthy, The Buddha and The Brahmin, as well as
in a number of discourses in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, where we come across
marvellously scintillating verses. This is understandable, since the dawn of
that wisdom which sees the voidness of a self and of everything belonging to a
self, and the attainment of the fruits of the path in the light of that wisdom,
marks the efflorescence as well as the fruition of the <em>saṁsāric</em> existence of a
being.</p>
<p>This idea comes up, for instance, in the section on flowers in the <em>Dhammapada</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā saṅkāradhānasmiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>Ujjhitasmiṁ mahāpathe,</em> <br />
<em>Padumaṁ tattha jāyetha,</em> <br />
<em>Sucigandhaṁ manoramaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ saṅkārabhūtesu,</em> <br />
<em>andhabhūte puthujjane,</em> <br />
<em>atirocati paññāya,</em> <br />
<em>sammāsambuddhasāvako.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn757-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn757">5</a></sup></p>
<p>As on top of a rubbish heap, <br />
Dumped by the highway side, <br />
There blossoms forth a lotus, <br />
Pure in fragrance and charming.</p>
<p>So amidst the worldlings blind, <br />
The Fully Awakened One’s disciple, <br />
Outshines them in marked contrast, <br />
In point of wisdom bright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, the <em>arahant</em> is that charming lotus, arising out of the cesspool of
<em>saṁsāra</em>. Surely there cannot be anything frightful about it. There is nothing
to get scared about this prospect.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we quoted from a discourse that gives some new definitions
and new concepts of the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn758-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn758">6</a></sup> We brought up two statements from the
<em>Lokakāmaguṇasutta</em> (No. 1) of the <em>Saḷāyatanavagga</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.
The first statement is somewhat riddle-like. There the Buddha addresses the
monks and declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, gamanena lokassa antaṁ ñātayyaṁ, daṭṭhayyaṁ, pattayyan’ti
vadāmi. Na ca panāhaṁ, bhikkhave, appatvā lokassa antaṁ dukkhassa antakiriyaṁ
vadāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn759-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn759">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I do not say that by travelling one can come to know or see or reach
the end of the world. Nor do I say that without reaching the end of the world
one can put an end to suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also mentioned, the other day, the explanation given by Venerable Ānanda to
this cryptic statement at the request of those monks who approached him to get
it clarified. That explanation embodies the definition given by the Buddha to
the term world. It is not the common concept of the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, ayaṁ vuccati ariyassa
vinaye loko. Kena c’āvuso lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī?</em></p>
<p><em>Cakkhunā kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, sotena … ghānena
… jivhāya … kāyena … manena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti
lokamānī. Yena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, ayaṁ vuccati
ariyassa vinaye loko.</em></p>
<p>Friends, that by which one has a perception of the world and has a conceit of
the world, that in this discipline of the Noble Ones is called ‘the world’. By
what, friends, has one a perception of the world and a conceit of the world?</p>
<p>By the eye, friends, one has a perception of the world and a conceit of the
world, by the ear … by the nose … by the tongue … by the body … by the
mind … That, friends, by which one has a perception of the world and a
conceit of the world, that in this discipline of the Noble Ones is called ‘the
world’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That with which the world is measured, that itself is called ‘the world’. The
above-mentioned measuring rods, namely the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue,
the body and the mind, give us a conceit of the world and a perception of the
world. Apart from these six there is no way of knowing a world. All theories
about the world are founded on these six sense-bases.</p>
<p>By way of a simple illustration, we alluded to the fact that in the absence of
any standard measuring rod, we resort to the primordial scales based on this
physical frame of ours, such as the inch, the span, the foot and the fathom.</p>
<p>The subtlest scale of measurement, however, is that based on the mind. It is in
this mode of measuring and reckoning that concepts and designations play their
part. But the Buddha’s philosophy of the void goes against all these mental
modes. His exorcism by the vision of the void fumigates all concepts and
designations.</p>
<p>The six sense-bases are therefore so many scales of measurement. It is with the
help of these that the world is measured. So the above definition of the world
brings out the ‘prepared’, <em>saṅkhata</em>, nature of the world. It is a
thought-construct.</p>
<p>This does not amount to a negation of the role of materiality. All we mean to
say is that the concept of the world is actually an outcome of these six sense
bases. To that extent it is something prepared, a thought-construct.</p>
<p>While discussing the ten indeterminate points on a previous occasion, we
happened to mention that the first four among them concern the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn760-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn760">8</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>“The world is eternal.”</li>
<li>“The world is not eternal.”</li>
<li>“The world is finite.”</li>
<li>“The world is infinite.”</li>
</ol>
<p>What those theorists meant by the term world in this context is none other than
that prepared world which is constructed by the six sense-bases. That is to say,
it is just the concept of the world.</p>
<p>However, they were not aware of the fact that their concept of the world is a
thought-construct, because they had no insight into the law of dependent
arising. They did not understand that these are mere preparations.</p>
<p>The fallacy involved here, that is, the inability to understand that their
concept of the world is the outcome of wrong attention, we illustrated by the
simile of the magic kettle.</p>
<p>In an exhibition a magic kettle is displayed from which water keeps on flowing
into a basin. One curious onlooker is waiting to see the kettle empty, while the
other is waiting to see the basin overflowing. Both are unaware of the fact that
a hidden tube conveys the water back again to the kettle, unseen through the
same flow of water.</p>
<p>The ordinary concept of the world carries with it the same fallacy. The
worldlings under the sway of defilements, which thrive on the perception of the
compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>, have the habit of grasping everything. The ordinary man
of the world, fully overcome by craving and grasping, entertains a perception of
permanence since he has no insight. That is why he regards the world as a unit
due to his perception of the compact, as he takes cognizance only of the arising
aspect, ignoring the decaying aspect.</p>
<p>Whether such a world is eternal or not, is the point at issue in the case of the
first set of questions mentioned above, while the next set poses the dilemma
whether it is finite or infinite. What is at the root of all those ill-conceived
notions, is the premise that it is possible to posit an absolute existence or an
absolute non-existence. In other words, the two extreme views ‘everything
exists’ and ‘nothing exists’.</p>
<p>The unique norm of dependent arising, which the Buddha discovered, dismisses
both those extreme views. It is set forth in the <em>Kaccāyanagottasutta</em> of the
<em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, which we have quoted earlier
too.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn761-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn761">9</a></sup> We shall, however, bring up again the relevant section to elucidate
this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvayanissito khvāyaṁ, Kaccāyana, loko yebhuyyena: atthitañceva natthitañca.
Lokasamudayaṁ kho, Kaccāyana, yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya passato yā loke
natthitā sā na hoti. Lokanirodhaṁ kho, Kaccāyana, yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
passato yā loke atthitā sā na hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn762-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn762">10</a></sup></p>
<p>This world, Kaccāyana, for the most part, bases its views on two things: on
existence and non-existence. Now, Kaccāyana, to one who with right wisdom sees
the arising of the world as it is, the view of non-existence regarding the
world does not occur. And to one who with right wisdom sees the cessation of
the world as it really is, the view of existence regarding the world does not
occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where our simile of the magic kettle becomes meaningful. Had both
onlookers understood that the magic kettle is getting filled at the same time it
gets emptied, and that the basin also gets filled while it is being emptied,
they would not have the curiosity to go on looking at it.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to both these viewpoints, the law of dependent arising
promulgated by the Buddha transcends them by penetrating into the concept as
such. The Buddha explained the arising of the world in terms of the twelve
factors, beginning with “dependent on ignorance preparations”, precisely because
it cannot be presented in one word.</p>
<p>Usually, the formula of dependent arising is summed up with the words <em>ayaṁ
dukkhasamudayo</em>, “this is the arising of suffering”, or with the more conclusive
statement <em>evam etassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti</em>, “thus is the
arising of this entire mass of suffering”.</p>
<p>There are also instances of explaining the arising of the world through the
principle underlying the norm of dependent arising. The world arises in the six
sense-bases. It is at the same time the arising of suffering. The arising of
suffering is almost synonymous with the arising of the world.</p>
<p>The law of dependent arising is an explanation of the way a concept of the world
comes about. This is an extremely subtle point. Since the concept of the world
is a product of wrong reflection, it is <em>saṅkhata</em>, or ‘prepared’. It is like
something imagined. The <em>saṅkhata</em>, or the ‘prepared’, has a certain circularity
about it.</p>
<p>In fact, the two dilemmas mentioned above involve the question of time and
space. The question whether the world is eternal or not eternal concerns time,
whereas the question whether the world is finite or infinite relates to space.</p>
<p>Both time and space involve a circularity. The furthest limit of the forenoon is
the nearest limit of the afternoon, and the furthest limit of the afternoon is
the nearest limit of the forenoon. This is how the cycle of the day turns round.
Where the forenoon ends is the afternoon, where the afternoon ends is the
forenoon.</p>
<p>A similar time cycle is to be found even in one moment. Rise and fall occur as a
cycle even within a single moment. The same process goes on within an aeon. That
is why an aeon is said to have the two aspects called <em>saṁvatta,</em> ‘contraction’,
and <em>vivaṭṭa</em>, ‘expansion’. World systems go on contracting and expanding.</p>
<p>The so-called existence of the world is a continuous process of contraction and
expansion. Therefore it is impossible to find any beginning or end. The very
question of a first beginning is ill conceived. It is like an attempt to find a
starting point in a cycle. It is a problem that cannot be solved by speculation.</p>
<p>Because of the cyclic nature of existence, rise and fall is characteristic of
every single moment. It is by ignoring the decaying aspect inherent in one
moment that wrong reflection gives rise to the inference that there must be an
absolute end of the world.</p>
<p>Because the visible world gets destroyed, one conceives of an absolute end of
the world. But when one world system gets destroyed, another world system gets
crystallized somewhere else. Speculative views and standpoints about the
universe, current among the worldlings, are of such a misleading nature that any
reasoning based on them leads to a circularity of argument as is evident from
the <em>Lokāyatikābrāhmaṇāsutta</em> among the Nines of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>This discourse is about two <em>Lokāyatikābrāhmins.</em> The term <em>Lokāyatika</em> is a
derivative from <em>lokāyata</em>, which signifies a branch of knowledge dealing with
the length and breadth of the world, perhaps a prototype of modern science,
though it relied more on logic than on experiment. The two Brahmins were
probably students of such a branch of learning. One day they came to the Buddha
and posed this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sire Gotama, now there is this teacher Pūraṇa Kassapa who claims omniscience,
saying that he sees everything and has knowledge and vision of everything
while walking or standing, whether asleep or awake. With these claims to
omniscience, he makes the following declaration:</p>
<p><em>Ahaṁ anantena ñāṇena anantaṁ lokaṁ jānaṁ passaṁ viharāmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn763-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn763">11</a></sup></p>
<p>“I dwell knowing and seeing an infinite world with an infinite knowledge.”</p>
<p>But then there is this teacher Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta who also has similar claims
to omniscience, but declares:</p>
<p><em>Ahaṁ antavantena ñāṇena antavantaṁ lokaṁ jānaṁ passaṁ viharāmi</em>.</p>
<p>“I dwell knowing and seeing a finite world with a finite knowledge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the two Brahmins ask the Buddha which of these two teachers claiming
omniscience in such contradictory terms is correct. But the Buddha’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Alaṁ brāhmaṇā, tiṭṭhat’ etaṁ … Dhammaṁ vo desissāmi</em>,</p>
<p>enough, brahmins, let that question be … I shall preach to you the Dhamma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression used here is suggestive of the fact that the question belongs to
the category of unexplained points. Terms like <em>ṭhapita</em>, ‘left aside’, and
<em>ṭhapanīya</em>, ‘should be left aside’, are used with reference to indeterminate
points.</p>
<p>Why did the Buddha leave the question aside? We can guess the reason, though it
is not stated as such.</p>
<p>Now the standpoint of Pūraṇa Kassapa is: “I dwell knowing and seeing an infinite
world with an infinite knowledge.” One can question the validity of his claim
with the objection: You see an infinite world, because your knowledge is not
finite, that is to say, incomplete. If it is complete, there must be an end.
Therefore, going by the sense of incompleteness in the word <em>anantaṁ</em>, one can
refute the former view. Why you see the world as infinite is because your
knowledge lacks finality.</p>
<p>Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, on the other hand, is asserting that he sees a finite world
with a finite knowledge. But the followers of Pūraṇa Kassapa can raise the
objection: You are seeing the world as finite because your knowledge is limited.
Your knowledge has an end, that is why you see a finite world. So here, too, we
have a circle, or rather a circularity of argument. The two terms <em>anta</em> and
<em>ananata</em> are ambiguous. That must be the reason why the Buddha rejected the two
standpoints in question.</p>
<p>Then he declares: “I shall preach to you the Dhamma”, and brings up as a simile
an illustration which could be summed up as follows. Four persons endowed with
the highest ability to walk, the highest speed and the widest stride possible,
stand in the four directions. Their speed is that of an arrow and their stride
is as wide as the distance between the eastern ocean and the western ocean. Each
of them tells himself: “I will reach the end of the world by walking” and goes
on walking for hundred years, that being his full life-span, resting just for
eating, drinking, defecating, urinating and giving way to sleep or fatigue, only
to die on the way without reaching the end of the world.</p>
<p>“But why so?”, asks the Buddha rhetorically and gives the following explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I do not say, O! Brahmins, that the end of the world can be known, seen or
reached by this sort of running. Nor do I say that there is an ending of
suffering without reaching the end of the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Brahmins, it is these five strands of sense pleasures that in the Noble One’s
discipline are called ‘the world’”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular context, the Buddha calls these five kinds of sense-pleasures
‘the world’ according to the Noble One’s terminology. This does not contradict
the earlier definition of the world in terms of the six sense-bases, for it is
by means of these six sense-bases that one enjoys the five strands of
sense-pleasures. However, as an art of preaching, the Buddha defines the world
in terms of the five strands of sense-pleasures in this context.</p>
<p>Then he goes on to proclaim the way of transcending this world of the five sense
pleasures in terms of <em>jhānic</em> attainments. When one attains to the first
<em>jhāna</em>, one is already far removed from that world of the five sense-pleasures.
But about him, the Buddha makes the following pronouncement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aham pi, brāhmaṇā, evaṁ vadāmi: ’ayam pi lokapariyāpanno, ayam pi anissaṭo
lokamhā’ti</em>,</p>
<p>“And I too, O! Brahmins, say this: ‘This one, too, is included in the world,
this one, too, has not stepped out of the world’”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha makes the same pronouncement with regard to those who attain to the
other <em>jhānic</em> levels. But finally he comes to the last step with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puna ca paraṁ, brāhmaṇā, bhikkhu sabbaso nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ samatikkama
saññāvedayitanirodhaṁ upasampajja viharati, paññāya c’assa disvā āsavā
parikkhīṇā honti. Ayaṁ vuccati, brāhmaṇā, bhikkhu lokassa antam āgamma lokassa
ante viharati tiṇṇo loke visattikaṁ.</em></p>
<p>“But then, O! Brahmins, a monk, having completely transcended the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, attains to and abides in the cessation
of perceptions and feelings, and in him, having seen with wisdom, the influxes
are made extinct. This one, O! Brahmins, is known as one who, on reaching the
end of the world, is dwelling at its very end, having crossed over the
agglutinative craving”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by these discourses, one might conclude that the cessation of perceptions
and feelings is actually Nibbāna itself. But the most important part of the
above quotation is the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>paññāya c’assa disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā honti</em>,</p>
<p>having seen with wisdom, the influxes are made extinct in him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings, all
preparations subside and it is on rising from it that all influxes are made
extinct by the vision of wisdom.</p>
<p>This fact comes to light in the following answer of Venerable Dhammadinnā Therī
to the question raised by the lay-follower Visākha, her former husband, in the
<em>Cūḷavedallasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāvedayitanirodhasamāpattiyā vuṭṭhitaṁ, kho āvuso Visākha, bhikkhuṁ tayo
phassā phusanti: suññato phasso, animitta phasso, appaṇihito phasso.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn764-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn764">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend Visākha, when a monk has emerged from the attainment of the cessation
of perceptions and feelings, three kinds of contact touch him: voidness
contact, signless contact, desireless contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this point, the commentary too, gives the explanation <em>suññatā nāma
phalasamāpatti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn765-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn765">13</a></sup> “‘voidness’ means the attainment of the fruit of
<em>arahanthood</em>”.</p>
<p>In answer to another question, Venerable Dhammadinnā Therī says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāvedayitanirodhasamāpattiyā vuṭṭhitassa, kho āvuso Visākha, bhikkhuno
vivekaninnaṁ cittaṁ hoti vivekapoṇaṁ vivekapabbhāraṁ</em>,</p>
<p>Friend Visākha, when a monk has emerged from the attainment of the cessation
of perceptions and feelings, his mind inclines to seclusion, slants to
seclusion, tends to seclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the commentary explains <em>nibbānaṁ viveko nāma</em>, “what is called seclusion
is Nibbāna”.</p>
<p>So it is on emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and
feelings, that is in the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, references to which we have
cited earlier,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn766-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn766">14</a></sup> that Nibbāna is realized. It is then that one actually
sees the end of the world.</p>
<p>So from this we can well infer that in advancing a new definition of the world,
in introducing a new concept of the world, the Buddha was not trying to
sidetrack the moot point of the worldlings by bringing in something totally
irrelevant. He was simply rejecting for some sound reason the worldlings’
concept of the world, which is born of wrong reflection, and illustrating the
correct measuring rod, the true criterion of judgement regarding the origin of
the concept of the world according to radical reflection.</p>
<p>Out of all the discourses dealing with the question of the end of the world and
the end of suffering, perhaps the most significant is the <em>Rohitassasutta</em>,
which is found in the <em>Sagāthakasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, as well as
in the section of the Fours in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>Once when the Buddha was staying at the Jetavana monastery at Sāvatthī, a deity
named Rohitassa visited him in the night and asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where Lord one does not get born, nor grow old, nor die, nor pass away, nor
get reborn, is one able, Lord, by travelling to come to know that end of the
world or to see it or to get there?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where, friend, one does not get born, nor grow old, nor die, nor pass away,
nor get reborn, that end of the world, I say, one is not able by travelling to
come to know or to see or to arrive at.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Buddha gave this brief answer, the deity Rohitassa praised him with the
following words of approbation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchariyaṁ bhante, abbhutaṁ bhante, yāva subhāsitam idaṁ bhagavatā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn767-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn767">15</a></sup></p>
<p>“it is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous, Lord, how well it is said by the
Exalted One.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did he express his approbation? Because he had already realized the truth of
the Buddha’s statement by his own experience. Then he goes on to relate the
whole story of his past life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In times past, Lord, I was a seer, Rohitassa by name, son of Bhoja, gifted so
that I could fly through the air, and so swift, Lord, was my speed that I
could fly just as quickly as a master of archery, well-trained, expert,
proficient, a past master in his art, armed with a strong bow, could without
difficulty send a light arrow far past the area coloured by a palm tree’s
shadow; and so great, Lord, was my stride that I could step from the eastern
to the western ocean. In me, Lord, arose such a wish as this: ‘I will arrive
at the end of the world by walking’. And though such, Lord, was my speed and
such my stride, and though with a life span of a century, living for a hundred
years, I walked continuously for hundred years, except for the times spent in
eating, drinking, chewing or tasting, or in answering calls of nature, and the
time I gave to way to sleep or fatigue, yet I died on the way, without
reaching the end of the world. Wonderful is it, O! Lord, marvellous is it,
Lord, how well it is said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>Where, friend, one does not get born, nor grow old, nor die, nor pass away,
nor get reborn, that end of the world, I say, one is not able by travelling to
come to know or to see or to arrive at.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is at this point, that the Buddha comes out with a momentous declaration,
while granting Rohitassa’s approbation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha kho, āvuso, na jāyati na jīyati na mīyati na cavati na upapajjati,
nāhaṁ taṁ ’gamanena lokassa antaṁ ñāteyyaṁ daṭṭheyyaṁ patteyyan’ti vadāmi. Na
cāhaṁ, āvuso, appatvā lokassa antaṁ dukkhassantakiriyaṁ vadāmi. Api c’āhaṁ,
āvuso, imasmiṁ yeva byāmamatte kaḷevare sasaññimhi samanake lokañca paññāpemi
lokasamudayañca lokanirodhañca lokanirodhagāminiñca paṭipadaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>“Where, friend, one does not get born, nor grow old, nor die, nor pass away,
nor get reborn, that end of the world, I say, one is not able by travelling to
come to know or to see or to arrive at. But neither do I say, friend, that
without having reached the end of the world there could be an ending of
suffering. It is in this very fathom-long physical frame with its perceptions
and mind, that I declare lies the world, the arising of the world, the
cessation of the world, and the path leading to the cessation of the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This momentous declaration, which is comparable to a fearless lion’s roar that
puts all religious and philosophical systems to flight, has been misinterpreted
by some who have not grasped its true significance. They say that according to
this discourse the cessation of the world is not here and that only the other
three are to be found in this fathom-long body.</p>
<p>Such misinterpretations are the result of taking seriously various far-fetched
speculations of later origin about Nibbāna. According to them, Nibbāna is some
mysterious non-descript place of rest for the <em>arahants</em> after their demise. One
who goes by that kind of speculation is not ready to accept the Buddha’s
declaration that it is in this very fathom-long body with its perceptions and
mind that a cessation of the world can be realized.</p>
<p>The commentary in this context simply observes that the four noble truths are to
be found not in grass and twigs outside, but in this body consisting of the four
elements.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn768-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn768">16</a></sup> It has nothing more to add. A certain modern scholar has
rightly pointed out that the commentator has missed a great opportunity for
exegesis.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn769-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn769">17</a></sup> The reason for the commentator’s lack of interest, in the case
of such a discourse of paramount importance, is probably his predilection for
these later speculations on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>All what we have so far stated in explaining the significance of discourses
dealing with the subject of Nibbāna, could even be treated as a fitting
commentary to the <em>Rohitassasutta</em>.</p>
<p>The point of relevance is the couple of words <em>sasaññimhi samanake</em>, occurring
in the discourse in question. This fathom-long physical frame is here associated
with perceptions and mind. The expression used by the Buddha in this context is
full of significance.</p>
<p>As we saw above, Venerable Ānanda defines the term ‘world’ as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yena kho, āvuso, lokasmiṁ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī, ayaṁ vuccati ariyassa
vinaye loko.</em></p>
<p>Friends, that by which one has a perception of the world and has a conceit of
the world that in the discipline of the Noble Ones is called ‘the world’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conceit of the world is a form of measuring with the mind. So the two words
<em>sasaññimhi samanake</em> are suggestive of the concept of the world in the Noble
Ones’ discipline.</p>
<p>While discussing the significance of <em>arahattaphalasamāpatti</em>, also known as
<em>aññāphalasamādhi</em>, and <em>aññāvimokkha</em>, we had occasion to bring up such
quotations as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Siyā nu kho, bhante, bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā neva
paṭhaviyaṁ paṭhavīsaññī assa, na āpasmiṁ āposaññī assa, na tejasmiṁ tejosaññī
assa, na vāyasmiṁ vāyosaññī assa, na ākāsānañcāyatane ākāsānañcāyatanasaññī
assa, na viññāṇañcāyatane viññāṇancāyatanasaññī assa, na ākiñcaññāyatane
ākiñcaññāyatanasaññī assa, na nevasaññānāsaññāyatane
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasaññī assa, na idhaloke idhalokasaññī assa, na paraloke
paralokasaññī assa, yam p’idaṁ diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ pariyesitaṁ
anuvicaritaṁ manasā tatrāpi na saññī assa, saññī ca pana assa?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn770-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn770">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Could there be, Lord, for a monk such an attainment of concentration wherein
he will not be conscious (literally: ‘percipient’) of earth in earth, nor of
water in water, nor of fire in fire, nor of air in air, nor will he be
conscious of the sphere of infinite space in the sphere of infinite space, nor
of the sphere of infinite consciousness in the sphere of infinite
consciousness, nor of the sphere of nothingness in the sphere of nothingness,
nor of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, nor will he be conscious of a this
world in this world, nor of a world beyond in a world beyond, whatever is
seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, traversed by the mind,
even of that he will not be conscious – and yet he will be conscious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> is so extraordinary that while in it one has no
perception of earth, water, fire and air, or of this world, or of the other
world, of whatever is seen, heard, sensed and cognized, but one is all the same
percipient or conscious, <em>saññī ca pana assa</em>.</p>
<p>To the question: “Of what is he percipient?”, <em>kiṁ saññī?</em>, once Venerable
Sāriputta gave the answer that the perception is of Nibbāna as the cessation of
existence, <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn771-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn771">19</a></sup></p>
<p>In another discourse that we happened to quote, the mode of questioning has the
following sequence: “Could there be, Lord, for a monk such an attainment of
concentration wherein he will not be attending to the eye, nor to form, nor to
the ear, nor to sound” etc., but ends with the riddle like phrase “and yet he
will be attending”, <em>manasi ca pana kareyya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn772-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn772">20</a></sup></p>
<p>When the Buddha grants the possibility of such a concentration, Venerable Ānanda
rejoins with an inquisitive “how could there be, Lord?”, and the Buddha explains
that what a monk attends to while in that attainment could be summed up in the
stereotyped phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṁ</em></p>
<p>This is peaceful, this is excellent, namely the stilling of all preparations,
the relinquishment of all assets, the destruction of craving, detachment,
cessation, extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Nibbāna, then, that one attends to while in that attainment. So we find
even the terms ‘perception’, <em>saññā</em>, and ‘attention’, <em>manasikāra</em>, being used
in the context of <em>arahattaphalasamāpatti</em>, or ‘attainment to the fruit of
<em>arahanthood</em>’.</p>
<p>Therefore, Nibbāna is not an experience as dry as a log of wood, but a state of
serene awareness of its true significance. It is a transcendence of the world by
realization of its cessation. That is why the two words <em>sasaññimhi samanake</em>,
‘with its perceptions and mind’, have been used to qualify, <em>kaḷevare</em>,
‘physical frame’, or ‘body’, in the momentous declaration.</p>
<p>We also came across some instances in the discourses where the Buddha calls the
cessation of the six sense-spheres itself Nibbāna. The most notable instance is
perhaps the <em>Kāmaguṇasutta</em> we had already quoted.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn773-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn773">21</a></sup> As we saw, even its
presentation is rather enigmatic. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, se āyatane veditabbe yattha cakkhuñca nirujjhati
rūpasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha sotañca nirujjhati
saddasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha ghānañca nirujjhati
gandhasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha jivhā ca nirujjhati
rasasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha kāyo ca nirujjhati
phoṭṭabbasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe yattha mano ca nirujjhati
dhammasaññā ca virajjati, se āyatane veditabbe.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn774-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn774">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, monks, that sphere should be known wherein the eye ceases and the
perception of forms fades away, the ear ceases and the perception of sounds
fades away, the nose ceases and the perception of smells fades away, the
tongue ceases and the perception of tastes fades away, the body ceases and the
perception of tangibles fades away, the mind ceases and the perception of
ideas fades away, that sphere should be known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Ānanda, commenting on this riddle-like sermon of the Buddha, concludes
that the Buddha is here referring to the cessation of the six sense-spheres,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>saḷāyatananirodhaṁ, āvuso, Bhagavatā sandhāya bhāsitaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Friends, it is with reference to the cessation of the six sense-spheres that
the Exalted One has preached this sermon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cessation of the six sense-spheres is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that the concept of a world is the product of the six
sense-spheres. Those six measuring rods have measured out a world for us.</p>
<p><strong>Since the world is built up by the six sense-spheres, it has also to cease by
the cessation of those six sense-spheres.</strong> That is why Nibbāna is defined as
the cessation of the six sense-spheres, <em>saḷāyatananirodho Nibbānaṁ</em>. All those
measuring rods and scales lose their applicability with the cessation of the six
sense-spheres.</p>
<p>How can there be an experience of cessation of the six sense-spheres? The
cessation here meant is actually the cessation of the spheres of contact. A
sphere of contact presupposes a duality. Contact is always between two things,
between eye and forms, for instance. It is because of a contact between two
things that one entertains a perception of permanence in those two things.</p>
<p>Dependent on that contact, feelings and perceptions arise, creating a visual
world. The visual world of the humans differs from that of animals. Some things
that are visible to animals are not visible to humans. That is due to the
constitution of the eye-faculty. It is the same with regard to the ear-faculty.
These are the measuring rods and scales which build up a world.</p>
<p>Now this world, which is a product of the spheres of sense-contact, is a world
of <em>papañca</em>, or ‘proliferation’. Nibbāna is called <em>nippapañca</em> because it
transcends this proliferation, puts an end to proliferation. The end of
proliferation is at the same time the end of the six sense-spheres.</p>
<p>There is a discourse in the section of the Fours in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> which
clearly brings out this fact. There we find Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita putting a
question to Venerable Sāriputta on this point. Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita and
Venerable Sāriputta are often found discussing intricate points in the Dhamma,
not because they are in doubt, but in order to clarify matters for us. They are
thrashing out problems for our sake. In this particular instance, Venerable Mahā
Koṭṭhita puts the following question to Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā atth’aññaṁ kiñci?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn775-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn775">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of
sense-contact, is there something left?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta’s response was: <em>Mā hevaṁ āvuso</em>, “Do not say so, friend.”</p>
<p>Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita follows it up with three other possible alternatives,
all of which Venerable Sāriputta dismisses with the same curt reply. The three
alternatives are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā natth’aññaṁ kiñci?</em></p>
<p>Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres
of sense-contact, is there nothing left?</p>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā atthi ca natthi ca aññaṁ
kiñci?</em></p>
<p>Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of
sense-contact, is it the case that there is and is not something left?</p>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā nev’atthi no natth’aññaṁ kiñci?</em></p>
<p>Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of
sense-contact, is it the case that there neither is nor is not something left?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mode of questioning takes the form of a tetralemma and Venerable Sāriputta
dismisses all the four alternatives as inapplicable. Then Venerable Mahā
Koṭṭhita asks why all these four questions were ruled out, and Venerable
Sāriputta explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā atth’aññaṁ kiñcī’ti, iti
vadaṁ appapañcaṁ papañceti.</em></p>
<p><em>’Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā natth’aññaṁ kiñcī’ti, iti
vadaṁ appapañcaṁ papañceti.</em></p>
<p><em>’Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā atthi ca natthi ca aññaṁ
kiñcī’ti, iti vadaṁ appapañcaṁ papañceti.</em></p>
<p><em>’Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā nev’atthi no natth’aññaṁ
kiñcī’ti, iti vadaṁ appapañcaṁ papañceti.</em></p>
<p><em>Yāvatā, āvuso, channaṁ phassāyatanānaṁ gati tāvatā papañcassa gati, yāvatā
papañcassa gati tāvatā channaṁ phassāyatanānaṁ gati.</em></p>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā papañcanirodho
papañcavūpasamo.</em></p>
<p>Friend, he who says: ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the
six spheres of sense-contact, there is something left’ is conceptually
proliferating what should not be proliferated conceptually.</p>
<p>Friend, he who says: ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the
six spheres of sense-contact, there is nothing left’ is conceptually
proliferating what should not be proliferated conceptually.</p>
<p>Friend, he who says: ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the
six spheres of sense-contact, there is and is not something left’ is
conceptually proliferating what should not be proliferated conceptually.</p>
<p>Friend, he who says: ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of the
six spheres of sense-contact, there neither is nor is not something left’ is
conceptually proliferating what should not be proliferated conceptually.</p>
<p>Friend, whatever is the range of the six spheres of sense-contact, that itself
is the range of conceptual proliferation, and whatever is the range of
conceptual proliferation, that itself is the range of the six spheres of
sense-contact.</p>
<p>By the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of
sense-contact, there comes to be the cessation and appeasement of conceptual
proliferation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentator gives the following explanation to the expression <em>atth’aññaṁ
kiñci</em>, “Is there something left?”: <em>’tato paraṁ koci appamattako pi kileso
atthī’ti pucchati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn776-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn776">24</a></sup> According to him, Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita is asking
whether there is even a little defilement left after the cessation of the six
spheres of sense-contact.</p>
<p>But the question is obviously not about the remaining defilements, in which case
even a categorical negative could have been the correct answer. The question
here is about the very usage of the expressions ‘is’ and ‘is not’.</p>
<p>With the cessation of the six spheres of sense-contact all four propositions of
the tetralemma, based on the two standpoints ‘is’ and ‘is not’, lose their
applicability. They are rejected in toto. Here the <em>papañca</em>, or ‘conceptual
proliferation’, implied, is the very discrimination between ‘is’ and ‘is not’.</p>
<p>The entire world is built up on the two concepts ‘is’ and ‘is not’. Being
unaware of the <em>saṅkhata</em>, or ‘prepared’, nature of these concepts, we are
accustomed to say ‘this is’ as occasion demands. This recording machine before
us ‘is there’. So also are the things which we presume to exist. We ourselves do
exist, do we not? One could say ‘I am’.</p>
<p>Out of the two rapid processes going on within us every moment, namely arising
and passing away, we are most of the time dwelling on the side of arising. The
two concepts ‘is’ and ‘is not’ are structured on the six spheres of
sense-contact. Not only ‘is’ and ‘is not’, but also the entire logical structure
connecting these two postulates is founded on these six spheres. Here, then, we
see the fistfuls of inflammable incense powder the Buddha had directed towards
language and logic, setting all that ablaze.</p>
<p>What this discourse highlights is the fact that by the very cessation of the six
spheres of sense-contact the cessation of conceptual proliferation is brought
about. With reference to speculative views, particularly to those wrong views
that were put aside as unexplained points, the Buddha uses the term
<em>diṭṭhipariḷāha</em>, ‘delirium of views’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn777-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn777">25</a></sup> <em>Pariḷāha</em> means ‘delirious
fever’.</p>
<p>Patients in delirium cry out for water. The worldlings, in general, are in high
delirium. Even such teachers like Pūraṇa Kassapa and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, who
were trying to solve these speculative problems about the world by logic, were
also in delirium. Their views, based on wrong reflections, were mere
hallucinations. They kept on raising such questions, because they had no insight
into the nature of <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or ‘preparations’.</p>
<p>The worldlings spend their whole lifetime running in search of the world’s end.
All that is <em>papañca</em>, conceptual proliferation. In fact, the term <em>papañca</em> is
so pervasive in its gamut of meaning that it encompasses the entire world.
Usually, the term is glossed over by explaining it with reference to <em>taṇhā,
māna</em> and <em>diṭṭhi</em>, bringing in craving, conceits and views as illustrations of
<em>papañca</em>. But that does not amount to an explanation proper. It is only a
definition in extension by giving three instances of <em>papañca</em>. To rattle off
the three instances is not a fit answer to the question ‘what is <em>papañca</em>’.</p>
<p>The primary significance of <em>papañca</em> is traceable to the linguistic medium. We
have already shown how the network of grammar spreads as soon as the peg ‘am’ is
driven down to earth, as it were.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn778-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn778">26</a></sup> The reality in the first person in
grammar beckons a second and a third person to complete the picture. In logic,
too, a similar legerdemain takes place. The interminable questions of identity
and difference lead the logician up the garden path.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘world’ is precariously perched on a fictitious network of grammar and
logic.</strong></p>
<p>It is as a solution to all this that the Buddha came out with the extraordinary
prospect of a cessation of the six spheres of sense-contact. This, then, is a
level of experience realizable here and now. That is why the Buddha declared
that the world is in this very fathom-long body with its perceptions and mind.</p>
<p>Now as to the questions about the world, we have already pointed out that there
is a circularity involved. Though one cannot find an end in something of a
cyclic nature, there is still a solution possible. There is only one solution,
that is, to break the cycle. That is what the term <em>vaṭṭupaccheda</em> means. One
can breach the cycle.</p>
<p>The cycle cannot be discovered by travelling. It is not out there, but in this
very stream of consciousness within us. We have already described it as the
vortex between consciousness and name-and-form. An allusion to the breach of the
vortex is found in the following verse, which we had already discussed in
connection with Nibbāna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati.</em></p>
<p><em>Ettha dīghañca rassañca,</em> <br />
<em>aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ettha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇassa nirodhena,</em> <br />
<em>etth’etaṁ uparujjhati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn779-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn779">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Consciousness, which is non-manifestative, <br />
Endless, lustrous on all sides, <br />
Here it is that earth and water, <br />
Fire and air no footing find.</p>
<p>Here it is that long and short, <br />
Fine and coarse, pleasant, unpleasant, <br />
And Name-and-form are cut off without exception, <br />
When consciousness has surceased, <br />
These are held in check herein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here one can see how name-and-form are cut off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ, anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ,</em></p>
<p>“consciousness, which is non-manifestative, infinite and lustrous on all
sides”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this consciousness even the four great primaries earth, water, fire and air,
do not find a footing.</p>
<p><em>Cakkavāla</em>, or a world-system, is supposed to be made up of these four primary
elements. Even the term <em>cakkavāla</em> implies something cyclic. The world is a
product of these primary elements, but these are not there in that
non-manifestative consciousness.</p>
<p>Such relative distinctions as long and short, subtle and gross, have no place in
it. Name-and-form cease there, leaving no residue. Like an expert physician, who
treats the germ of a disease and immunizes the patient, the Buddha effected a
breach in the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex by concentrating on its epicycle within this
fathom-long body.</p>
<p>The ever recurrent process of mutual interrelation between consciousness and
name-and-form forming the epicycle of the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex was breached. With
the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form. With the
cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of consciousness. That is the
dictum of the <em>Naḷakalāpīsutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn780-1"><a href="sermon-23.html#fn-fn780">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Out of the two bundles of reeds left standing, supporting each other, when one
is drawn the other falls down. Even so, with the cessation of consciousness
comes the cessation of name-and-form. With the cessation of name-and-form comes
the cessation of consciousness. That is how the Buddha solved this problem.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twentyfourth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon, we brought up a quotation from the <em>Rohitassasutta</em>, which
enshrines a momentous declaration by the Buddha to the effect that the world,
the arising of the world, the cessation of the world, and the path leading to
the cessation of the world, could be pointed out with reference to this same
body with its perceptions and mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn782-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn782">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The six sense-spheres, or the six bases of sense-contact, with which we acquaint
ourselves with the world as it is conventionally understood and measured out,
are themselves called ‘the world’ according to the Noble One’s
terminology.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn783-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn783">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, one can declare in accordance with the Dhamma, that the very
cessation of those six sense-spheres is the cessation of the world. It is this
state of the cessation of the world that is known as <em>asaṅkhata dhātu</em>, or the
‘unprepared element’. That unprepared state, described in discourses on Nibbāna
in such terms as <em>atthi, bhikkhave, ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṁkataṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn784-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn784">4</a></sup>
“monks, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unprepared”, is this
cessation of the six spheres of sense, which is the end of that prepared world.</p>
<p>So, then, this particular world’s end, the end of the world as defined here, is
not a destination to be reached by travelling. The sage Rohitassa walked for
hundred years in search of this world’s end at a speed of a flying arrow, but he
failed to discover the world’s end. Why? It is because he took ‘the world’ along
with him in his journey to see its end. Since this six-based body with its
perceptions and mind is itself the world, he was taking the world with him in
his exploration. That is why he had to die on the way without seeing the end of
the world.</p>
<p>That end of the world, which one cannot see or reach by travelling, the Buddha
pointed out in the very cessation of the six sense-spheres. This fact comes to
light in the discourses dealing with Nibbāna in the <em>Pāṭaligāmiyavagga</em> of the
<em>Udāna</em>, which we had already discussed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn785-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn785">5</a></sup> For instance, in the first
discourse on Nibbāna, beginning with the words <em>atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ</em>,
“there is, monks, that sphere”, we find towards the end the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tatra p’ahaṁ, bhikkhave, n’eva āgatiṁ vadāmi na gatiṁ na ṭhitiṁ na cutiṁ na
upapattiṁ, appatiṭṭhaṁ appavattaṁ anārammaṇaṁ eva taṁ, es’ ev’ anto
dukkhassa.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn786-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn786">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that particular state, described as a ‘sphere’, in which there is neither
earth, nor water, nor fire, nor air, etc.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I say, there is neither a coming, nor a going, nor a standing, nor a passing
away, nor a being reborn; that state which is unestablished, non continuing
and objectless, is itself the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, this journey’s end, the journey’s end that cannot be reached by
journeying, the Buddha pointed out in the cessation of the six sense-spheres.</p>
<p>We come across the following passage in the fourth discourse on Nibbāna in the
<em>Pāṭaligāmiyavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nissitassa calitaṁ, anissitassa calitaṁ natthi, calite asati passaddhi,
passaddhiyā sati nati no hoti, natiyā asati āgatigati na hoti, āgatigatiyā
asati cutūpapāto na hoti, cutūpapāte asati n’ ev’ idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantare, es’ ev’ anto dukkhassa.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn787-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn787">7</a></sup></p>
<p>To the attached there is wavering, to the unattached there is no wavering;
wavering not being, there is calm; calm being, there is no inclination;
inclination not being, there is no coming and going; coming and going not
being, there is no passing away or reappearing; when there is no passing away
or reappearing, there is neither a ‘here’, nor a ‘there’, nor anything between
the two – this is the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in such profound terms, that the Buddha described the end of the world.
One cannot see it by journeying. It can be seen only by wisdom. In fact, even
the very concept of ‘going’ has to be transcended in order to see it.</p>
<p>So, it seems, Rohitassa carried the world with him in his journey to see the end
of the world. He made another blunder. He was going in search of a place where
there is no death, in order to escape death. Even that, the Buddha had declared,
is not possible to see or reach by travelling.</p>
<p>Rohitassa took Māra along with him in his journey to find a place where there is
no death. Why do we say so? In the <em>Rādhasaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> we
find Venerable Rādha putting the following question to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Māro, māro’ti, bhante, vuccati, kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, ’māro’ti
vuccati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn788-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn788">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Māra, Māra, they say, venerable sir, to what extent is Māra called as such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is how the Buddha answers the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe kho, Rādha, sati Māro vā assa māretā vā yo vā pana mīyati. Tasmātiha
tvaṁ, Rādha, rūpaṁ ’Māro’ti passa, ’māretā’ti passa, ’mīyatī’ti passa,
’rogo’ti passa, ’gaṇḍo’ti passa, ’sallan’ti passa, ’aghan’ti passa,
’aghabhūtan’ti passa. Ye nam evaṁ passanti te sammā passanti.</em></p>
<p>Where there is form, Rādha, there would be a Māra, or one who kills, or one
who dies. Therefore, Rādha, in this context you look upon form as ‘Māra’, as
‘one who kills’, as ‘one who dies’, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as a
misery, as a wretchedness. They that look upon thus are those that see
rightly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the case of form, so also in regard to feeling, perception, preparations
and consciousness, the same mode of seeing rightly is recommended. So, in this
context, each of the five aggregates is looked upon as a Māra, from the point of
view of the Dhamma. That is why we say that Rohitassa went in search of a
deathless place taking death along with him.</p>
<p>From this definition it is clear that so long as one grasps with craving the
aggregates of form, feeling, perception, preparations and consciousness, there
is a Māra, a killer, and one who dies. Therefore it is, that by giving up the
five aggregates one is freed from Māra, is liberated from death and attains the
deathless state. That is why we said that the <em>arahant</em> has attained the
deathless state, here and now, in this world itself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn789-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn789">9</a></sup> The principle
involved here we have already stated while discussing the law of dependent
arising.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn790-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn790">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Let us remind ourselves of the relevant section of a verse in the
<em>Bhadrāvudhamāṇavappucchā</em> of the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ yaṁ hi lokasmiṁ upādiyanti,</em> <br />
<em>ten’ eva Māro anveti jantuṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn791-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn791">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever thing they grasp in this world, <br />
By that itself Māra pursues a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of grasping, there is becoming or existence and with it birth, decay and
death, etc., follow suit, all due to craving. That is the deep idea behind the
Buddha’s definition of the five grasping groups in terms of Māra.</p>
<p>In fact, these six sense-spheres, the six bases, are within the jurisdiction of
Māra. This is evident from Māra’s own words in the <em>Kassakasutta</em> of the
<em>Sagāthakavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>Once, when the Buddha was admonishing the monks with a sermon on Nibbāna, it
occurred to Māra, the Evil One:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now this recluse Gotama is admonishing the monks and the monks are listening
attentively. I must go and blind their eye of wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this evil intention, he came there in the guise of a farmer, carrying a
plough on his shoulder, a goad in his hand, with dishevelled hair and muddy
feet, and asked the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Recluse, did you see my oxen?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha retorted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is the use of oxen for you, Evil One?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Māra understood that the Buddha had recognized him and came out with the
following boast of his superiority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mam eva, samaṇa, cakkhu, mama rūpā, mama cakkhusamphassaviññānāyatanaṁ, kuhiṁ
me, samaṇa, gantvā mokkhasi?</em></p>
<p><em>Mam eva, samaṇa, sotaṁ … Mam eva, samaṇa, ghānaṁ …Mam eva, samaṇa, jivhā
… Mam eva, samaṇa, kāyo …</em></p>
<p><em>Mam eva, samaṇa, mano, mama dhammā, mama manosamphassaviññānāyatanaṁ, kuhiṁ
me, samaṇa, gantvā mokkhasi?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn792-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn792">12</a></sup></p>
<p>“Mine, O recluse, is the eye, mine are the forms and mine the sphere of
eye-contact, where will you, recluse, go to escape me?</p>
<p>Mine, O recluse, is the ear … Mine, O recluse is the nose … Mine, O
recluse is the tongue … Mine, O recluse is the body …</p>
<p>Mine, O recluse is the mind, mine are the mind-objects and mine the sphere of
mind-contact, where will you, recluse, go to escape me?“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is how the Buddha responded to that challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taveva, pāpima, cakkhu, tava rūpā, tava cakkhusamphassaviññāṇāyatanaṁ, yattha
ca kho, pāpima, natthi cakkhu, natthi rūpā, natthi
cakkhusamphassaviññāṇāyatanaṁ, agati tava tattha pāpima.</em></p>
<p><em>Taveva, pāpima, sotaṁ … Taveva, pāpima, ghāṇaṁ … Taveva, pāpima, jivhaṁ
… Taveva, pāpima, kāyaṁ …</em></p>
<p><em>Taveva, pāpima, mano, tava dhammā, tava manosamphassaviññāṇāyatanaṁ, yattha
ca kho, pāpima, natthi mano, natthi dhammā, natthi
manosamphassaviññāṇāyatanaṁ, agati tava tattha pāpima.</em></p>
<p>“Yours, O Evil One, is the eye, yours are the forms and yours the sphere of
eye-contact, but where there is no eye, no forms and no sphere of eye-contact,
there you cannot go, Evil One.</p>
<p>Yours, Evil One, is the ear … Yours, Evil One, is the nose … Yours, Evil
One, is the tongue … Yours, Evil One, is the body …</p>
<p>Yours, Evil One, is the mind, yours are the mind-objects and yours the sphere
of mind-contact, but where there is no mind, no mind-objects and no sphere of
mind-contact, there you cannot go, Evil One.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Buddha’s reprisal to Māra’s challenge, we can well infer that there
indeed is a place to which Māra has no access. That is none other than the
cessation of the six sense-spheres. Since it is something realizable, it is
referred to as a ‘sphere’ in such contexts as, for instance, in the discourse on
Nibbāna beginning with the words <em>atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn793-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn793">13</a></sup>
“there is, monks, that sphere”, etc.</p>
<p>It is this same cessation of the six sense-spheres that is referred to as
<em>papañcanirodha</em> and <em>papañcavūpasama</em>, cessation or appeasement of conceptual
proliferation. In the <em>Mahākoṭṭhitasutta</em> we discussed in our previous sermon,
we found Venerable Sāriputta making the following conclusive statement to the
same effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Channaṁ, āvuso, phassāyatanānaṁ asesavirāganirodhā papañcanirodho
papañcavūpasamo</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn794-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn794">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Friend, by the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of
sense-contact, there comes to be the cessation and appeasement of conceptual
proliferation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That itself is the non-prolific state. All concepts of ‘going’, ‘coming’, ‘being
born’, ‘growing old’ and ‘dying’, are to be found in the prolific. They simply
do not exist in the non-prolific. That is why it is inaccessible to Māra. In it,
neither the sense-bases, such as the eye, ear and nose, nor their respective
objects are to be found. So it is clear that the cessation of the six
sense-spheres is that state of release from Māra, attainable here and now.</p>
<p>All the six sense-spheres are built up on the perception of permanence.
Therefore, the realization of their cessation is possible only through the
perception of impermanence. The contemplation of impermanence is the path to its
realization.</p>
<p>An extremely subtle contemplation on impermanence, that can bring about the
cessation of the six sense-spheres, is to be found in the <em>Dvayamsutta</em> (No. 2)
of the <em>Saḷāyatanavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. <em>Dvayaṁ</em> means a dyad. There
are two discourses by that name, and this is the second. A strikingly deep
vision of consciousness unfolds itself in this discourse as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvayaṁ, bhikkhave, paṭicca viññāṇaṁ sambhoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, dvayaṁ
paṭicca viññāṇaṁ sambhoti? Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ.
Cakkhu aniccaṁ vipariṇāmi aññathābhāvi. Rūpā aniccā vipariṇāmino

<p><em>Cakkhuviññāṇaṁ aniccaṁ vipariṇāmi aññathābhāvi. Yo pi hetu yo pi paccayo
cakkhuviññāṇassa uppādāya, so pi hetu so pi paccayo anicco vipariṇāmī
aññathābhāvī. Aniccaṁ kho pana, bhikkhave, paccayaṁ paṭicca uppannaṁ
cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, kuto niccaṁ bhavissati?</em></p>
<p><em>Yā kho, bhikkhave, imesaṁ tiṇṇaṁ dhammānaṁ saṅgati sannipāto samavāyo, ayaṁ
vuccati, bhikkhave, cakkhusamphasso. Cakkhusamphasso pi anicco vipariṇāmī

so pi paccayo anicco vipariṇāmī aññathābhāvī. Aniccaṁ kho pana, bhikkhave,
paccayaṁ paṭicca uppanno cakkhusamphasso, kuto nicco bhavissati?</em></p>
<p><em>Phuṭṭho, bhikkhave, vedeti, phuṭṭho ceteti, phuṭṭho sañjānāti. Itthete pi
dhammā calā ceva vayā ca aniccā vipariṇāmino aññathābhāvino.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn795-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn795">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even by listening to it, one can easily guess that there is a string of terms
giving the idea of impermanence. Let us now try to translate it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dependent on a dyad, monks, consciousness comes to be. How is it, monks, that
consciousness comes to be dependent on a dyad? Depending on eye and forms
arises eye-consciousness. Eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.
Forms are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is
unstable, evanescent, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
<p>Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Whatever cause
and condition there is for the arising of eye-consciousness, that cause, that
condition, too, is impermanent, changing and becoming otherwise. How can
eye-consciousness, arisen in dependence on an impermanent condition, be
permanent, monks?</p>
<p>That concurrence, that meeting, that togetherness of these three things,
monks, is called eye-contact. Even the eye-contact, monks is impermanent,
changing, becoming otherwise. Whatever cause and condition there is for the
arising of eye-contact, that cause and condition, too, is impermanent,
changing and becoming otherwise. How can eye-contact, arisen in dependence on
an impermanent condition, be permanent, monks?</p>
<p>Contacted, monks, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives.
Thus these things, too, are unstable, evanescent, impermanent, changing and
becoming otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sutta proceeds in this way, stressing the impermanence of the other
sense-spheres as well, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind. The
entire discourse vibrates with the tone of impermanence.</p>
<p>It is the law of dependent arising that the Buddha presents here with reference
to the six sense-spheres. In other words, how the world gets built up. It is not
founded on stable existing things, but on what is impermanent, unstable and
changing, whose nature is to become otherwise. This is how the entire perception
of the world is built up. Its foundation is always crumbling, changing and
transforming.</p>
<p>Generally, in the discourse dealing with the question of sense-restraint, one
comes across the phrase</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>na nimittaggāhi nānuvyañjanaggāhī</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn796-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn796">16</a></sup></p>
<p>he doesn’t grasp a sign nor does he dwell on its details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tendency to grasp a sign in regard to the objects of the six senses is the
result of the perception of permanence. Due to the perception of permanence,
there is a grasping of signs, and due to that grasping of signs, influxes flow
in. Proliferations through craving, conceits and views get heaped up. This is
how our world is constructed. This is the way the aggregates of attachment get
accumulated. On the other hand, the contemplation of impermanence that leads to
the signless concentration is helpful in freeing the mind from these signs.</p>
<p>The reflection on an object can be of two types. Where there is a perception of
permanence, the tendency is to grasp the object tenaciously and hang on to it.
This pervert tendency is known as <em>parāmasana</em>. It is impelled by the triple
proliferations of craving, conceits and views. Under its influence one is
carried away by prolific perceptions, <em>papañcasaññā</em>, and is kept under the sway
of worldly concepts and designations born of prolific perceptions,
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the perception of impermanence fosters a detached and observant
attitude in reflection, which is known as <em>sammasana</em>. It is that healthy
attitude which progressively leads to the liberation of the mind from the
influence of signs, and attenuates the prolific tendencies to craving, conceits
and views.</p>
<p>This kind of reflection is the harbinger of insight. Contemplation of
impermanence on these lines effectively puts an end to this entire mass of
<em>saṁsāric</em> suffering, as is evident from the following powerful declaration by
the Buddha in the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccasañña, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā sabbaṁ kāmarāgaṁ pariyādiyati,
sabbaṁ rūparāgaṁ pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ bhavarāgaṁ pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ avijjaṁ
pariyādiyati, sabbaṁ asmimānaṁ pariyādiyati samūhanati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn797-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn797">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The perception of impermanence, monks, when developed and intensively
practised, extirpates all sensual lust, extirpates all lust for forms,
extirpates all lust for existence, extirpates all ignorance and extirpates and
eradicates the conceit ‘am’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contemplation of impermanence, therefore, strikes at the very root of this
entire mass of <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering. The discourse on the dyad, quoted above,
amply illustrates this fact. The recurrent terms like <em>cala</em>, ‘unstable’, and
<em>vaya</em>, ‘evanescent’, in the passage, indicate that the entire superstructure of
sensory knowledge is founded on certain pervert attitudes. An imperceptible
impermanence underlies it.</p>
<p>In a number of sermons we had to bring up the simile of the motion picture. The
simile is not our own, but only a modernization of a canonical simile used by
the Buddha himself. The point of divergence was the question the Buddha had
addressed to the monks in the <em>Gaddulasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhaṁ vo, bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittaṁ?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn798-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn798">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, have you seen a picture called a movie?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monks answer in the affirmative, and so the Buddha proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tampi kho, bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittaṁ citteneva cintitaṁ. Tena pi kho,
bhikkhave, caraṇena cittena cittaññeva cittataraṁ.</em></p>
<p>Monks, that picture called a movie is something thought out by the mind. But
the thought itself, monks, is even more picturesque than that picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that it is more picturesque is to suggest its variegated character.
Thought is intrinsically variegated. We have no idea what sort of a motion
picture was there at that time, but the modern day movie has a way of concealing
impermanence by the rapidity of projections of the series of pictures on the
screen. The rapidity itself gives an impression of permanence, which is a
perversion, <em>vipallāsa</em>.</p>
<p>The movie is enjoyable because of this perversion. Due to the perception of
permanence, there is a grasping of signs, and in the wake of it influxes flow
in, giving rise to proliferation, due to which one is overwhelmed by reckonings
born of prolific conceptualization, <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>. That is how one enjoys
a film show. All this comes about as a result of ignorance, or lack of awareness
of the cinematographic tricks concealing the fleeting, vibrating and evanescent
nature of the scenes on the screen.</p>
<p>Though we resort to such artificial illustrations, by way of a simile, the
Buddha declares that actually it is impossible to give a fitting simile to
illustrate the rapidity of a thought process. Once he proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Upamā pi na sukarā yāva lahuparivattaṁ cittaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn799-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn799">19</a></sup></p>
<p>it is not easy even to give a simile to show how rapidly thought changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the Buddha resorts to double entendre to bring out piquantly some deep
idea. He puns on the word <em>citta</em>, ‘thought’ or ‘picture’, in order to suggest
the ‘picturesque’ or variegated nature of thought, when he asserts that thought
is more picturesque, <em>cittatara</em>, than the picture. We can see that it is quite
reasonable in the light of the <em>Dvayamsutta</em>. It is this series of picturesque
formations that gives us a perception of permanence, which in turn is
instrumental in creating a world before our eyes.</p>
<p>Our eye changes every split second. It is quivering, vibrating and transient. So
also are the forms. But there is a malignantly pervert idea, ingrained in
<em>saṁsāric</em> beings, known as the perception of permanence in the impermanent,
<em>anicce niccasaññā</em>, which prevents them from seeing the inherent transience of
eye and forms. That is how the six spheres of sense create a world before us.</p>
<p>It is the substructure of this sense created world that the Buddha has revealed
to us in this particular discourse on impermanence. The substructure, on
analysis, reveals a duality, <em>dvayaṁ, bhikkhave, paṭicca viññāṇaṁ sambhoti</em>,
“dependent on a dyad, monks, arises consciousness”.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not something substantial and absolute, like the so-called
soul. That is precisely the point of divergence for Buddhism, when compared with
those religious systems which rely on soul theories.</p>
<p>In the Dhamma there is mention of six consciousnesses, as <em>cakkhuviññāṇa,
sotaviññāṇa, ghānaviññāṇa, jivhāviññāṇa, kāyaviññāṇa</em> and <em>manoviññāṇa</em>, eye-,
ear-, nose-, tongue-, body- and mind-consciousness. Everyone of these
consciousnesses is based on a dyad.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of eye-consciousness we are given the formula beginning with
<em>cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca</em>, “dependent on eye and forms”, so with regard to
ear-consciousness we get <em>sotañca paṭicca sadde ca</em>, “dependent on ear and
sounds”, and so on. Even when we come to mind-consciousness, the theme is the
same, <em>manañca paṭicca dhamme ca</em>, “dependent on mind and mind-objects”. Mind
also is vibrating, changing and transforming with extreme rapidity every moment.
So are the objects of the mind.</p>
<p>The entire world is structured on these vibrant, transient and evanescent basic
elements. That is the burden of this powerful discourse of the Buddha.
Therefore, if someone developed the contemplation of impermanence to the highest
degree and brought his mind to the signless state, having started from the sign
itself, it goes without saying that he has realized the cessation of the world.
That is, the experience of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>It is, at the same time, the cessation of proliferation, <em>papañcanirodha.</em>
Prolific conceptualization is founded on the perception of permanence, whereby
one comes under the sway of reckonings born of prolific perceptions,
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>. Proliferation creates things, giving rise to the
antinomian conflict. Duality masquerades behind it.</p>
<p>It is by mistaking the impermanent eye and the impermanent forms as permanent
that the whole confusion has come about. One imagines the eye and forms as
permanent and thereby becomes blind to their momentary change and transience.
The glue of craving and intoxicating influxes create a facade of a real world
before him. That is the world we touch with our hands and see with our eyes. All
this exposes the insubstantial nature of this world.</p>
<p>The products of the six sense-bases can be summed up by the four terms <em>diṭṭha,
suta, muta</em> and <em>viññāta</em>, things seen, heard, sensed and cognized. The
<em>Dvayamsutta</em> brings to light the fact that all these four are insubstantial and
coreless.</p>
<p>Due to this very fact, the Tathāgata who realized the cessation of the six
sense-bases, was confronted with the stupendous problem of mediating with the
world that could not even imagine the frightful prospect of a cessation of the
six sense-bases. That is to say, when he reached the state of non-proliferation,
<em>nippapañca</em>, by experiencing the cessation of the world through the cessation
of the six sense-bases, the Tathāgata had to grapple with the serious problem of
truth and falsehood in mediating with the world.</p>
<p>There is an extremely important discourse connected with the idea of the void,
<em>suññatāpaṭisaṁyutta</em>, which echoes this epistemological crisis, in the section
of the Fours in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, entitled <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>. This
<em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> was preached by the Buddha to the congregation of monks at the
Kāḷaka monastery in the city of Sāketa. The discourse, though brief, is one
that is extremely deep in its presentation of the idea of the void.</p>
<p>Before getting down to an exposition of this discourse, by way of sketching its
historical background, we may mention a few things. Apart from the mention of
the venue, nothing much could be gleaned from the discourse itself as to how it
was inspired. The commentaries, however, relate the episode of Cūḷasubhaddhā,
daughter of Anāthapiṇḍika, to explain the context in which the discourse was
preached.</p>
<p>Cūḷasubhaddhā, who was a stream-winner, <em>sotāpanna</em>, was given in marriage to
the son of the millionaire Kāḷaka of Sāketa, a devout follower of Nigaṇṭha
Nātaputta. Cūḷasubhaddhā managed to convert him by inviting the Buddha to Sāketa
and getting Kāḷaka to listen to the Dhamma. After his conversion, he built a
monastery in his park and offered it to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The commentary says that a group of five-hundred newly ordained monks of Sāketa
gathered in this Kāḷaka monastery and were speaking in praise of the Buddha,
marvelling at his extraordinary feat of converting the millionaire and the
inhabitants of Sāketa.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that the Buddha came and addressed this deep discourse
to those monks. According to the commentary, the discourse was so profound that
at five points of the sermon the earth shook miraculously and at the end of the
sermon all the five-hundred monks who listened to it attained <em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>It is chronicled in the history of Buddhism that, during the great missionary
movement initiated by the emperor Asoka, Venerable Mahā Rakkhita was sent to
convert the country of the Yonakas. The very first sermon he preached there was
based on this <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>, on hearing which thirty-seven-thousand attained
fruits of the noble path. If the identification of the Yonakas with the Greeks
is correct, the choice of this deeply philosophical discourse is understandable.</p>
<p>According to the chronicles and the commentaries, another significant occasion
in which the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> served as a theme was when Kālabuddharakkhita
Thera gave an all-night sermon on the dark night of the new-moon Poya day,
seated under the black Timbaru tree at Cetiya Pabbata in Sri Lanka. King
Saddhātissa was also present in the audience.</p>
<p>The fact that this discourse was held in high esteem is evident from its
historical background. As in the case of many other deep discourses, here too we
are faced with the problem of variant readings. Even the commentator is at a
loss to conclude and editors go their own way. We have to wade through the
variant readings to make some sense out of the discourse as it is handed down.
Let us now take up the relevant portions of this abstruse discourse.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is seen,
heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and pondered over by the mind, all that
do I know.</p>
<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is seen,
heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and pondered over by the mind, that
have I fully understood. All that is known to the Tathāgata, but the Tathāgata
has not taken his stand upon it.</p>
<p>If I were to say, monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and
Brahmas, among the progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men,
whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and pondered over
by the mind, all that I do not know, it would be a falsehood in me. If I were
to say I both know it and know it not, that too would be a falsehood in me. If
I were to say I neither know it nor am ignorant of it, it would be a fault in
me.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, a Tathāgata does not imagine a visible thing as apart from
seeing, he does not imagine an unseen, he does not imagine a thing worth
seeing, he does not imagine a seer. He does not imagine an audible thing as
apart from hearing, he does not imagine an unheard, he does not imagine a
thing worth hearing, he does not imagine a hearer. He does not imagine a thing
to be sensed as apart from sensation, he does not imagine an unsensed, he does
not imagine a thing worth sensing, he does not imagine one who senses. He does
not imagine a cognizable thing as apart from cognition, he does not imagine an
uncognized, he does not imagine a thing worth cognizing, he does not imagine
one who cognizes.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, being such in regard to all phenomena, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, is such. Moreover than he who is such there is
none other higher or more excellent, I declare.</p>
<p>Whatever is seen, heard, sensed, <br />
Or clung to and esteemed as truth by other folk, <br />
Midst those who are entrenched in their own views, <br />
Being such, I hold none as true or false.</p>
<p>This barb I beheld well in advance, <br />
Whereon mankind is hooked impaled, <br />
I know, I see, ’tis verily so, <br />
No such clinging for the <em>tathāgatas</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first statement the Buddha declares that he knows, <em>tam ahaṁ jānāmi</em>,
whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and pondered over by
all beings in the world, and that is the sum total of the knowledge acquired
through the six sense-bases.</p>
<p>In the second statement he affirms that the knowledge he has is of a higher
order, <em>tam ahaṁ abhaññāsiṁ</em>, that amounts to an understanding, <em>taṁ
tathāgatasssa viditaṁ</em>, by virtue of which he does not take his stand upon it,
he has no stance, <em>taṁ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi</em>.</p>
<p>The third statement flows from this detached perspective. It is to the effect
that the Tathāgata cannot disclaim knowledge, despite his detached attitude, as
it would be tantamount to prevarication in the eyes of the world, <em>taṁ mama assa
musā</em>.</p>
<p>The fourth statement highlights the same incongruity, because the Tathāgata
placed in this awkward situation cannot compromise by both claiming and
disclaiming knowledge at the same time, <em>tam ahaṁ ’jānāmi ca na ca jānāmī’ti
vadeyyaṁ, taṁ p’assa tādisam eva.</em></p>
<p>As the fifth statement makes it clear, the Tathāgata does not deem it fit to
wriggle out by neither claiming nor disclaiming knowledge of sense-data.</p>
<p>Then comes the declaration as to how the Tathāgata treats this body of sensory
knowledge of the worldling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, monks, a Tathāgata does not imagine a visible thing as apart from the
seen,</p>
<p><em>iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have come across the terms <em>diṭṭha, suta, muta, viññāta</em> quite often, for
instance in our discussion of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> in the context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ
bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn801-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn801">21</a></sup></p>
<p>in the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
be just the cognized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In common parlance, the word ‘seen’ connotes something seen. But here we have
something more radical, avoiding substantialist insinuations. It is just the
seen in the seen, implied by <em>diṭṭha</em>, in this context too. The Tathāgata takes
it just as a seen, without imagining that there is something substantial
worthwhile seeing, as apart from it, <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati.</em></p>
<p>We are already familiar with the term <em>maññanā</em>, having discussed it in such
discourses as the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> and the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn802-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn802">22</a></sup> It stands
for imaginings, prompted by cravings, conceits and views. The Tathāgata is free
from such imaginings. He does not imagine a thing worthwhile seeing apart from
the seen, nor does he imagine an unseen, <em>adiṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em>. The phenomenon
of seeing is not denied.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>daṭṭhabbaṁ na maññati</em> conveys the idea that the Tathāgata does not
imagine that there is something worth seeing, that there is something essential
in it. <em>Daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati</em>, he does not imagine a seer or one who sees. He
does not project an agent into the phenomenon by taking seriously the
subject-object relationship.</p>
<p>With regard to the heard, <em>suta</em>, the sensed, <em>muta</em>, and the cognized,
<em>viññāta</em>, too, the Tathāgata has no such imaginings. Then, in summing up it is
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññātabbesu dhammesu tādi,
yeva tādi</em>,</p>
<p>thus, monks, the Tathāgata, being such in regard to all phenomena, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, is ‘such’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>tādī</em>, too, came up in a number of our earlier sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn803-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn803">23</a></sup> We
rendered it by ‘such’. It stands for the quality of steadfastness of the
<em>arahant</em> in remaining unshaken by the eight worldly vicissitudes.</p>
<p>His mainstay, in this respect, is <em>atammayatā</em>, or non-identification. He is
such because he does not grasp any of those things as ‘mine’. So he is ‘such’ in
regard to whatever is seen, heard, sensed and cognized. There is no one who is
higher or more excellent than this such-like-one in point of suchness. Then
comes a couplet of verses, presenting the gist of the sermon.</p>
<p>Our rendering of the sermon is in need of further explication. Though it gives a
general idea, some words and phrases in the original have far reaching
implications. The basic idea behind the series of declarations made is the
extraordinary change of attitude towards the question of speculative views,
which marks off the Tathāgata from all his contemporaries.</p>
<p>He took a completely different turn, transcending the extremes of eternalism and
annihilationism. This difference of attitude is revealed by the riddle like
statements in the first part of the discourse. One gets the impression that the
Tathāgata was confronted with a problematic situation of the highest order.</p>
<p>The first statement is to the effect that the Tathāgata knows whatever in the
world with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the progeny consisting of recluses
and Brahmins, gods and men, is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and
pondered over by the mind.</p>
<p>The second statement asserts that the Tathāgata has a higher understanding of
all that. All the same, he takes no stance in regard to whatever is seen, heard,
sensed and cognized.</p>
<p>This might appear as a riddle. Usually when one has a higher understanding of
something, one is inclined to take one’s stand upon it. But here we have a
denial. The discourse bears some resemblance to the tetralemma we had discussed
earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn804-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn804">24</a></sup> But there seems to be a difference here, in the formulation of
the first proposition of the tetralemma.</p>
<p>Normally the first proposition amounts to an unqualified assertion of the
affirmative standpoint. In this case, however, we find the statement that the
Tathāgata not only knows all what the world knows, but that he has a higher
understanding of it, <em>abhaññāsiṁ</em>. It is precisely because he has a higher
understanding that he takes no stance in regard to it.</p>
<p>This might appear problematic, but let us remind ourselves of the two levels of
understanding mentioned in the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, discussed earlier, namely
<em>sañjānāti</em> and <em>abhijānāti</em>. As an instance of the first level of
understanding, we get the following passage in that discourse in regard to the
untaught ordinary person, <em>assutavā puthujjano</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito sañjānāti. Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito saññatvā paṭhaviṁ maññati,
paṭhaviyā maññati, paṭhavito maññati, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati, paṭhaviṁ
abhinandati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn805-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn805">25</a></sup></p>
<p>He perceives earth as ‘earth’. Having perceived earth as ‘earth’, he imagines
‘earth’ as such, he imagines ‘on the earth’, he imagines ‘from the earth’, he
imagines ‘earth is mine’, he delights in earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The untaught ordinary person has a perceptual knowledge of earth, <em>sañjānāti</em>.
That, too, is a level of knowledge. It is in fact the lowest grade of knowing.
The untaught ordinary person can do no better than perceive earth as earth.</p>
<p>Having perceived earth as earth, he takes it seriously by its face value and
goes on imagining by way of craving, conceit and views, granting it
object-status. He imposes the grammatical superstructure on it. He imagines ‘on
the earth’, he imagines ‘from the earth’, he imagines ‘earth is mine’, he
delights in earth. This, then, is the lowest grade of knowledge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about the Tathāgata’s level of understanding, the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> has the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhijānāti, paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ na
maññati, paṭhaviyā na maññati, paṭhavito na maññati, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti na
maññati, paṭhaviṁ nābhinandati.</em></p>
<p>He understands through higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’, having understood
through higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’, he does not imagine earth to be
‘earth’, he does not imagine ‘on the earth’, he does not imagine ‘from the
earth’, he does not imagine ‘earth is mine’, he does not delight in earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tathāgata, who has a higher knowledge of earth, as suggested by the word
<em>abhijānāti</em>, does not entertain imaginings by taking earth at its face value.
He is not carried away by the grammatical structure to imagine in such terms as
‘on the earth’ and ‘from the earth’.</p>
<p>In the present context, too, the same distinction in grades of knowledge is
evident. Firstly, the Tathāgata says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that do I know, that have I fully understood. All that is known to the
Tathāgata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is precisely because of this full understanding that he has not taken his
stand upon it. He has no stance in regard to all that. This is the gist of the
first paragraph of the discourse, which sounds more or less a paradox. It is
because of this apparently queer state of affairs that the Tathāgata had to
confess that it would be a falsehood on his part to say: “All that I do not
know”.</p>
<p>If someone asks whether it is because he does not know that he takes no stance,
he cannot say: “Yes”. As a matter of fact, it is precisely because he has
understood that he takes no stance. But the worldlings are of the opinion that
knowledge of a thing entitles one to assert it dogmatically.</p>
<p>To say “I both know it and know it not” or “I neither know it nor am ignorant of
it” would also be mistaken by the world as a prevarication or equivocation. The
first paragraph of the discourse has to be understood in this light.</p>
<p>The commentary has it that the earth shook at five points in the discourse.
According to it the three significant terms <em>jānāmi, abbhaññāsiṁ</em> and <em>viditaṁ</em>,
‘I know’, ‘I have fully understood’, all that is ‘known’ to the Tathāgata
represent a plane of omniscience, <em>sabbaññutabhūmi</em>, peculiar to a
Buddha.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn806-1"><a href="sermon-24.html#fn-fn806">26</a></sup> Even at the end of this proclamation of omniscience, it is said
the earth shook as a mark of approbation.</p>
<p>Then the phrase <em>na upaṭṭhāsi</em>, “does not take his stand upon it”, is
interpreted by the commentary as indicating the plane of the influx-free one,
<em>khīṇāsavabhūmi</em>. Why the Tathāgata has no stance in regard to sensory data is
said to be due to his freedom from influxes. He does not grasp them by way of
craving, conceit and views. He does not take his stand upon things seen, heard,
sensed and cognized. He has no inclination or clinging towards them.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twentyfifth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna. The other day we made an attempt to understand, in the light
of the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>, the enlightened attitude of the Tathāgata, who has
realized the cessation of the six bases of sense-contact, towards the
view-points of the worldlings, who find themselves confined within those six
bases.</p>
<p>In that discourse, the Buddha declared with the words <em>tam ahaṁ jānāmi</em>, “[all]
that do I know”,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn808-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn808">2</a></sup> the fact that he has understood all what the world with
its gods, Māras and Brahmas, and the progeny consisting of recluses and
Brahmins, gods and men, have seen, heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and
pondered over by the mind.</p>
<p>By his next assertion <em>tam ahaṁ abbhaññāsiṁ</em>, the Buddha proclaimed that he not
only knows all that, but knows it thoroughly in some special way. With the words
<em>taṁ tathāgatassa viditaṁ</em>, he declares that by virtue of this special knowledge
he has understood all what the world claims to know. Despite this special
knowledge and understanding, the Tathāgata takes no stance and has no
inclination or partiality towards those sensory data, as is evident from the
expression <em>taṁ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi.</em></p>
<p>Worldings in general are in the habit of asserting dogmatically “I know, I see,
it is verily so”, <em>jānāmi passāmi tath’ eva etaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn809-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn809">3</a></sup> when they have a
special knowledge or understanding of something or other.</p>
<p>But according to this discourse, it seems that the Buddha takes no stance and
has no inclination or partiality towards those sensory data, precisely because
he has a special knowledge and understanding with regard to them. This fact is
highlighted by the concluding summary verses, particularly by the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jānāmi passāmi tath’ eva etaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhositaṁ n’ atthi tathāgatānaṁ.</em></p>
<p>I know, I see, ’tis verily so. <br />
No such clinging for the <em>tathāgatas</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to explain this strange difference of attitude, we quoted the other day
two significant terms from the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima-nikāya</em>,
namely <em>sañjānāti</em> and <em>abhijānāti</em>. They represent two levels of knowledge in
the context of that particular discourse.</p>
<p><em>Sañjānāti</em> stands for perceptual knowledge, whereas <em>abhijānāti</em> conveys the
idea of some special understanding of a higher order. The level of knowledge
implied by the term <em>sañjānāti</em> is that which characterizes the ordinary
worldling’s world view. He is deluded by the mirage-like perception in his view
of the world and goes on imagining, <em>maññanā</em>, a real world enslaved to the
patterns of the grammatical structure.</p>
<p>But the Tathāgata has penetrated into the true nature of those seens, heards,
sensed and the like, with his extraordinary level of higher knowledge,
<em>abhiññā</em>, yielding full comprehension. Therefore, he does not take his stand
upon any of them. He has no stance to justify the usage of the term <em>upaṭṭhāsi</em>,
since he does not entertain imaginings, <em>maññanā</em>.</p>
<p>What is called <em>maññanā</em> is the imagining in egoistic terms, imparting reality
to illusory things. It is this principle of refraining from vain imaginings that
is indicated by the term <em>na upaṭṭhāsi</em>, “does not take his stand upon”.</p>
<p><em>Tathāgatas</em> have no clinging or entanglement, <em>ajjhositaṁ</em>, precisely because
they entertain no imaginings. In regard to things seen, heard, etc. the
<em>tathāgatas</em> have no clinging, binding or entanglement by way of craving, conceit
and views, respectively.</p>
<p>We happened to mention the other day that those peculiar declarations, with
which the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> opens, bear some resemblance to the tetralemma
discussed in our treatment of the undetermined points.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn810-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn810">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The set of four alternative propositions concerning the Tathāgata’s after death
state may be cited as a paradigm for the tetralemma.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā</em>, <br />
“the Tathāgata exists after death”;</li>
<li><em>na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā,</em> <br />
“the Tathāgata does not exist after death”;</li>
<li><em>hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā,</em> <br />
“the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death”;</li>
<li><em>n’eva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā,</em> <br />
“the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn811-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn811">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The declarations found in this discourse bear some affinity to the
above-mentioned tetralemma. However, we find here the Buddha making the first
declaration in several stages. Firstly, he makes the statement that whatever is
seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, thought after and pondered over by all beings
in the world, that he knows.</p>
<p>In the second statement he affirms that he has a higher knowledge of all that.
Then comes a sentence which reaffirms that the Tathāgata has understood, but
ends with the statement “the Tathāgata does not take his stand upon it”.</p>
<p>Generally, when confronted with the tetralemma, the Buddha summarily dismisses
all the four alternative propositions. But here the peculiarity is in not
dismissing the first proposition at once. He declares that he knows, that he has
a higher knowledge, and that he has understood all that.</p>
<p>Apparently he is affirming the first proposition, granting the validity of
sensory data. But then comes the concluding statement to the effect that he does
not take his stand upon them, <em>na upaṭṭhāsi</em>, which amounts to a negation.</p>
<p>The secret behind this peculiar presentation will emerge when we bring up the
proper similes and parables. Till then, what can be gleaned from the context is
that the Tathāgata has no stance, not because he is ignorant, but due to the
very fact that he knows full well and has understood the nature of the sum total
of sensory data.</p>
<p>The worldlings are prone to think that it is when convincing knowledge is
lacking that one has no such stance. But the Buddha declares here that he takes
no stance in regard to what is seen, heard, sensed etc., precisely because he
has a special understanding, a penetrative knowledge of the essence-lessness of
the data obtained through the six sense-bases.</p>
<p>So it seems, in this context too, we have the negation of the first alternative,
as is usual in the case of a tetralemma, only that the negation is expressed
here in a very peculiar way. Let us now take up the second declaration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ
pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā, tam ahaṁ ’na jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama
assa musā.</em></p>
<p>If I were to say, monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and
Brahmas, among the progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men,
whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, thought after and pondered
over by the mind, all that I do not know, it would be a falsehood in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a difference of opinion as to the correct reading of this second
declaration. Deep suttas often present difficulties in determining the exact
reading, and this is especially the case with the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>.</p>
<p>In this instance, the commentary has followed the reading <em>tam ahaṁ ’jānāmī’ti
vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama assa musā</em>, “if I were to say ‘that I know’, it would be a
falsehood in me”. But as we have pointed out earlier, this reading is not
meaningful.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn812-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn812">6</a></sup> That is probably why the <em>Chaṭṭhasaṅgīti-piṭaka</em> edition has
followed the variant reading <em>tam ahaṁ ’na jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ</em>, “if I were to
say ‘that I do not know’”. This departure from the commentarial tradition seems
justifiable, since the Buddha has already declared that he knows all that.</p>
<p>It stands to reason, therefore, that in the second declaration he makes it clear
that to say “I do not know” would be a contradiction, a falsehood. But why this
clarification?</p>
<p>Generally the worldlings expect one to unequivocally assert and take one’s stand
upon one’s viewpoint in categorical terms, as expressed by the dictum <em>idam eva
saccaṁ, mogham aññaṁ</em>, “this alone is true, all else is false”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn813-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn813">7</a></sup> Failure
to do so is recognized as a lack of knowledge or precision.</p>
<p>The second declaration is meant to forestall such an objection, since the first
declaration ends with the clause <em>taṁ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi</em>, but “the
Tathāgata has not taken his stand upon it”. So it amounts to a statement like
“it is not because I do not know that I take no stance”. In the same strain, we
can explain the declarations that follow.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that the second declaration,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tam ahaṁ ’na jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama assa musā</em>,</p>
<p>if I were to say, “all that I do not know”, it would be a falsehood in me,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>amounts to the second alternative of the tetralemma.</p>
<p>The next declaration follows the same trend. To quote the relevant portion,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tam ahaṁ ‘jānāmi ca na ca jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ, taṁ p’ assa tādisam eva,</em></p>
<p>if I were to say “I both know it and do not know it”, that too would be a
falsehood in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regard to the aforesaid seens, heards, sensed etc., if I were to say that I
know, I do not know, or even a combination of both those statements as “I both
know and do not know”, it would be a falsehood on my part.</p>
<p>Why? Because the world is accustomed to put down such a vacillation to a lack of
certitude. To say “I both know it and know it not” looks like a confession of
partial knowledge, since it can mean knowledge and ignorance going fifty-fifty.
So the Buddha says, in this instance, too, that it would likewise be a
falsehood, <em>taṁ p’ assa tādisam eva</em>.</p>
<p>Now we come to the fourth statement. The Buddha declares,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if I were to say “I neither know it, nor am ignorant of it”, it would be a
fault in me,</p>
<p><em>tam ahaṁ ’neva jānāmi na na jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama assa kali</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can understand that position, too. Generally the worldlings think that a
refusal to make a categorical statement is either due to partial knowledge, or
to an attitude of wriggling out. In fact, this attitude of wriggling out had
already assumed the status of a philosophy in itself in Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, a
contemporary of the Buddha.</p>
<p>When he was interrogated, he would respond with such a series of negations like
“I do not say it is, I do not say it is thus, I do not say it is otherwise, nor
do I say it is neither”, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn814-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn814">8</a></sup> The attempt here is to evade the issue by
a sort of ‘eel-wriggling’. That school of philosophy, which resorted to such an
evasive legerdemain, came to be known as <em>amarā-vikkhepa-vāda</em>. The Buddha
refuses to subscribe to such tactical sophistry by rejecting the fourth
alternative ‘I neither know it, nor am ignorant of it’.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have the same tetralemma, presented in a different guise. It
smacks of a riddle that the Buddha was confronted with – the riddle of coming to
terms with worldly parlance. As we have already mentioned, the commentary
analyses the main theme of the discourse into five planes. It also records that
the earth shook at five points of the discourse, that is, at the end of the
proclamation for each plane.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn815-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn815">9</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the commentary, the first plane is the plane of omniscience,
<em>sabbaññutabhūmi</em>. The phrases representative of that plane are said to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>tam ahaṁ jānāmi,</em> “that I know”,</li>
<li><em>tam aham abbhaññāsiṁ</em>, “that have I fully understood”, and</li>
<li><em>taṁ tathāgatassa viditaṁ</em>, “that is known to the Tathāgata”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then comes the plane of the influx-free one, <em>khīṇāsavabhūmi</em>, represented by
the section ending with the phrase:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>na upaṭṭhāsi</em>, “does not take his stand upon it”.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is so called because that phrase brings out the characteristic of not taking
a stance by way of cravings, conceits and views in the case of an influx-free
one.</p>
<p>The three phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>taṁ mama assa musā</em>, “it would be a falsehood on my part”,</li>
<li><em>taṁ p’ assa tādisam eva</em>, “likewise, that too would be a falsehood in me”, and</li>
<li><em>taṁ mama assa kali</em>, “it would be a fault in me”,</li>
</ul>
<p>are interpreted by the commentary as representing the third plane of truth,
<em>saccabhūmi</em>. We have now dealt with that, too.</p>
<p>What comes next as the fourth plane is the deepest of all. The commentary calls
it the plane of the void, <em>suññatābhūmi</em>. It is with good reason that it is so
called. The paragraph that follows is said to represent that plane; it runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati, adiṭṭhaṁ
na maññati, daṭṭhabbaṁ na maññati, daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati. Sutā sotabbaṁ sutaṁ
na maññati, asutaṁ na maññati, sotabbaṁ na maññati, sotāraṁ na maññati. Mutā
motabbaṁ mutaṁ na maññati, amutaṁ na maññati, motabbaṁ na maññati, motāraṁ na
maññati. Viññātā viññātabbaṁ viññātaṁ na maññati, aviññātaṁ na maññati,
viññātabbaṁ na maññati, viññātāraṁ na maññati.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, too, we are confronted with the question of variant readings. To begin
with, here we have given the phrase <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ</em>, whereas the
commentary takes it as <em>daṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ</em>. According to the commentary,
<em>daṭṭhā</em> is a hypothetical variant of the absolutive form <em>disvā</em>, for it
paraphrases <em>’daṭṭhā daṭṭhabban’ti disvā daṭṭhabbaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn816-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn816">10</a></sup> that is, “<em>daṭṭhā
daṭṭhabbaṁ</em> stands for <em>disvā daṭṭhabbaṁ</em>”. So the whole sentence in question is
said to convey the sense “having seen, he does not imagine a seen worth seeing”.
But the variant reading <em>diṭṭha</em> is granted, though the commentator prefers the
reading <em>daṭṭha</em> as it is suggestive of an absolutive <em>dṛṣṭvā</em>.</p>
<p>Taking the cue from this commentarial preference, the Burmese <em>Chaṭṭhasaṅgīti</em>
edition goes a step further in substituting <em>sutvā, mutvā</em> and <em>viññatvā</em> rather
arbitrarily to give an absolutive twist to the three phrases that follow as
<em>sutvā sotabbaṁ sutaṁ</em>, <em>mutvā motabbaṁ mutaṁ</em>, and <em>viññatvā viññātabbaṁ
viññātaṁ</em>. Probably the editors thought that in this context the terms <em>diṭṭha
suta muta</em> and <em>viññāta</em> could not be interpreted as they are.</p>
<p>But we may point out that, in keeping with the line of interpretation we have
followed so far, these three terms may be said to stand for an extremely deep
dimension of this discourse, dealing with the void. The other day we simply gave
a sketch of a possible rendering.</p>
<p>The statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>has to be interpreted as an assertion that the Tathāgata</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does not imagine a sight worthwhile seeing as apart from the seen,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that there is nothing substantial in the seen. So also the other statements,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sutā sotabbaṁ sutaṁ na maññati</em>,</p>
<p>does not imagine a worthwhile hearing apart from the heard;</p>
<p><em>mutā motabbaṁ mutaṁ na maññati</em>,</p>
<p>does not imagine a worthwhile sensing apart from the sensed;</p>
<p><em>viññātā viññātabbaṁ viññātaṁ na maññati</em>,</p>
<p>does not imagine a worthwhile cognition apart from the cognized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case our interpretation still appears problematic, we may hark back to the
<em>Bāhiyasutta</em> we have already explained at length.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn817-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn817">11</a></sup> The philosophy behind
the Buddha’s exhortation to the ascetic Bāhiya could be summed up in the words</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ
bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn818-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn818">12</a></sup></p>
<p>in the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
be just the cognized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is meant is that one has to stop at just the seen, without discursively
imagining that there is some-‘thing’ seen, some-‘thing’ substantial behind the
seen. Similarly in regard to the heard, one has to take it as just a heard, not
some-‘thing’ heard.</p>
<p>In the case of the phrase <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> the word
<em>diṭṭhā</em>, being in the ablative case, we may render it as “does not imagine a
sight worthwhile seeing ‘as apart from’ the seen”.</p>
<p>By way of further clarification of this point, we may revert to the simile of
the dog on the plank, which we gave in our explanation of <em>nāma-rūpa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn819-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn819">13</a></sup>
The simile, of course, is not canonical, but of fable origin.</p>
<p>When a dog, while crossing a stream, stops halfway on the plank and starts
wagging its tail and peeping curiously down, the reason is the sight of its own
image in the water. It imagines a dog there, a ‘water-dog’. The dog thinks that
there is something worthwhile seeing, apart from the seen.</p>
<p>It is unaware of the fact that it is seeing what it sees because it is looking.
It thinks that it is looking because there is something out there to be seen.
The moment it realizes that it is seeing because it is looking, it will stop
looking at its own image in the water.</p>
<p>We have here a very subtle point in the law of dependent arising, one that is
integral to the analysis of name-and-form. So, then, due to the very ignorance
of the fact that it is seeing because it is looking, the dog imagines another
dog, there, in the water. What is called <em>maññanā</em> is an imagining of that sort.</p>
<p>No such imagining is there in the Tathāgata, <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na
maññati</em>, “he does not imagine a sight worth seeing as apart from the seen”. In
short, for him the seen is the be all and the end all of it.</p>
<p>The seen is dependently arisen, it comes about due to a collocation of
conditions, apart from which it has no existence per se. Every instance of
looking down at the water is a fresh experience and every time an image of the
dog in the water and of another looking at it is created. The dog is seeing its
own image. Everything is dependently arisen, <em>phassapaccayā</em>, says the
<em>Brahmajāla-sutta</em>, ‘dependent on contact’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn820-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn820">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Here there is something really deep. It is because of the personality-view,
<em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, that the world is carried away by this illusion. One goes on
looking saying that one is doing so as there is something to be seen. But the
seen is there because of the looking.</p>
<p>This, then, is the moral behind the statement <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na
maññati</em>, “does not imagine a seen worthwhile seeing as apart from the seen
itself”. This is the dictum implicit in the <em>Bāhiya-sutta</em>, too, which could be
illustrated by the simile of the dog on the plank. The Tathāgata does not
imagine a sight as existing from the bare act of seeing.</p>
<p>If further illustrations are needed, let us take the case of hearing music from
a distance. One imagines a thing called ‘music’ and with the idea of listening
to the same music goes to the place where the music is going on. One is not
aware of the fact that at each step in that direction one is hearing a different
music. Why? Because one is ignorant of the law of dependent arising. Just as in
the former case the dog seen is dependent on the dog looking, here too, the
auditory consciousness of a music is the outcome of a dependence between ear and
sound.</p>
<p>So, deluded as he is, he goes to the music hall to listen better to the same
music. He will realize the extent of his delusion if he happens to put his ear
to the musical instrument. When he does so, he will hear not a music, but a set
of crude vibrations.</p>
<p>But this is what is going on in the world. The world is steeped in the delusion
of imagining that it is the same music one is hearing, though at each step in
that direction the music changes. This is due to the fact that it is dependently
arisen. Actually, there is no person hearing, but only a state of affairs
dependent on the ear and sound, a conditioned arising dependent on contact. In
the present textual context, the terms <em>diṭṭha suta muta</em> and <em>viññāta</em>, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, have to be understood in this light.</p>
<p>So this is how the phrase <em>diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> has to be
interpreted. But the commentary does not seem to have appreciated the relevance
of this paragraph to the Buddha’s teachings on voidness. While commenting on
<em>diṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> it expatiates <em>’ahaṁ mahājanena diṭṭhameva passāmī’ti
taṇhāmānadiṭṭhīhi na maññati</em>. According to it, what is meant is that the
Tathāgata does not imagine by way of cravings, conceits and views that he is
seeing just what the common people have seen. This is an oversimplification, a
rather shallow interpretation.</p>
<p>The next phrase, <em>adiṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em>, is similarly explained, <em>’adiṭṭhaṁ na
maññatī’ti ’ahaṁ mahājanena adiṭṭhameva etaṁ passāmī’ti evampi taṇhādihi
maññanāhi na maññati</em>, “he does not imagine an unseen” means that the Tathāgata
does not imagine by way of imaginings through craving etc. that he is seeing
something unseen by the common people. The commentary, it seems, has gone at a
tangent, bypassing the deeper sense.</p>
<p>We have already explained the deeper significance of the phrase, <em>diṭṭhaṁ na
maññati</em>, “does not imagine a seen”. Now what does <em>adiṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> mean?</p>
<p>In terms of our simile of the dog on the plank, <em>diṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> means that
the Tathāgata does not imagine a dog in the water.</p>
<p><em>Adiṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em> could therefore mean that the Tathāgata does not imagine
that the dog has not seen. Why he does not treat it as an unseen should be clear
from that declaration we had already cited, ending with <em>tam ahaṁ ’na jānāmī’ti
vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama assa musā,</em> “if I were to say ‘that I do not know’, it would
be a falsehood in me”.</p>
<p>The fact of seeing is not denied, though what is seen is not taken as a dog, but
only as an image of one, that is dependently arisen. Since the understanding of
it as a dependently arisen phenomenon is there, the Tathāgata does not imagine
an unseen either, <em>adiṭṭhaṁ na maññati</em>.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>daṭṭhabbaṁ na maññati</em>, is also explicable in the light of the
foregoing discussion. Now, the dog on the plank keeps on looking down at the
water again and again because it thinks that there is something worthwhile
seeing in the water. Such a delusion is not there in the Tathāgata. He knows
that at each turn it is a phenomenon of a seen dependently arisen, dependent on
contact, <em>phassapaccayā</em>.</p>
<p>Every time it happens, it is a fresh sight, a new preparation, <em>saṅkhāra</em>. So
there is nothing to look for in it. Only a looking is there, nothing worth
looking at. Only a seeing is there, nothing to be seen. Apart from the bare act
of hearing, there is nothing to be heard. It is the wrong view of a self that
gives a notion of substantiality. The above phrase, therefore, is suggestive of
insubstantiality, essencelessness, and voidness.</p>
<p>Music is just a word. By taking seriously the concept behind that word, one
imagines a thing called ‘music’. The pandemonium created by a number of musical
instruments is subsumed under the word ‘music’. Then one goes all the way to
listen to it. The same state of affairs prevails in the case of the seen. It is
because the Tathāgata has understood this fact that he does not imagine a thing
worth seeing or hearing. The same applies to the other sensory data.</p>
<p>Then comes the phrase <em>daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati</em>, “does not imagine a seer”. Here we
have the direct expression of voidness – the voidness of a self or anything
belonging to a self. Now that dog on the plank has not understood the fact that
there is a mutual relationship between the looking dog and the seen dog. It is
because of the looking dog that the seen dog is seen. There is a conditioned
relationship between the two.</p>
<p>In other words, dependent on eye and forms arises eye-consciousness, <em>cakkhuñca
paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn821-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn821">15</a></sup> The mere presence of the eye
is not enough for eye consciousness to arise, but dependent on eye and forms,
arises eye-consciousness.</p>
<p>Though stated simply, it has a depth that is not easy to fathom. To say that it
is dependent on eye and form is to admit that it is dependently arisen. The law
of dependent arising is already implicated. There is therefore no seer, apart
from the phenomenon of seeing, according to the Tathāgata. He does not imagine a
seer, <em>daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati</em>. For the worldling, the bare act of seeing carries
with it a perception of ‘one who sees’. He has a notion of a self and something
belonging to a self.</p>
<p>The same teaching is found in the <em>Bāhiya-sutta</em>. After instructing Bāhiya to
stop at just the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized, the Buddha goes
on to outline the end result of that training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato kho te, Bāhiya, diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ
bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati, tato
tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena. Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha.
Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev’ idha na huraṁ na
ubhayamantarena. Es’ ev’ anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn822-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn822">16</a></sup></p>
<p>And when to you, Bāhiya, there will be in the seen just the seen, in the heard
just the heard, in the sensed just the sensed, in the cognized just the
cognized, then, Bāhiya, you are not by it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not by
it, then, Bāhiya, you are not in it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not in it,
then, Bāhiya, you are neither here nor there nor in between. This, itself, is
the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, when, Bāhiya, you have gone through that training of stopping at
just the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized, then you would not be
imagining in terms of them. The algebraic – like expressions <em>na tena</em> and <em>na
tattha</em> have to be understood as forms of egoistic imagining, <em>maññanā</em>.</p>
<p>When you do not imagine in terms of them, you would not be in them. There would
be no involvement in regard to them. In the case of that music, for instance,
you would not be in the orchestra. The egoistic imagining, implicating
involvement with the music, presupposes a hearer, <em>sotaraṁ</em>, dwelling in the
orchestra.</p>
<p>When, Bāhiya, you do not dwell in it, <em>yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha</em>, then,
Bāhiya, you are neither here, nor there, nor in between the two, <em>tato tvaṁ
Bāhiya nev’ idha na huraṁ na ubhayamantarena</em>. This itself is the end of
suffering. In other words, you would have realized voidness, <em>suññatā</em>.</p>
<p>The expression <em>daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati</em>, “does not imagine a seer”; <em>sotāraṁ na
maññati</em>, “does not imagine a hearer”; <em>motāraṁ na maññati</em>, “does not imagine a
sensor”; and <em>viññātāraṁ na maññati</em>, “does not imagine a knower”, have to be
understood in this light. The Tathāgata does not even imagine a thinker apart
from thought. This is the plane of the void, <em>suññatābhūmi</em>, the perfect
realization of the corelessness or essencelessness of the seen, the heard, the
sensed and the cognized.</p>
<p>The very absence of <em>maññanā</em>, or ‘egoistic imagining’, is to be understood by
<em>suññatābhūmi</em>, or ‘the plane of the void’. The worldling takes seriously the
subject-object relationship in the grammatical structure, as it seems the
simplest explanation of phenomena. Because there is something to be seen, there
is someone who sees. Because there is someone who sees, there is something to be
seen.</p>
<p>There is a duality between these two. To understand the law of dependent arising
is to be free from this duality. It is the ability to see a concatenation of
conditions, a conglomeration of causal factors – an assemblage instead of a
bifurcation.</p>
<p>The way of the worldlings, however, is to follow the subject-object
relationship, a naive acceptance of the grammatical structure, which is the
easiest mode of communication of ideas. They are misled by it to take seriously
such notions as ‘one who sees’ and a ‘thing seen’, ‘one who hears’ and a ‘thing
heard’, but the Tathāgata is free from that delusion.</p>
<p>Now we come to the fifth section of the discourse, known as <em>tādibhūmi</em>, the
‘plane of the such’. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññātabbesu dhammesu tādī
yeva tādī, tamhā ca pana tādimhā añño tādī uttaritaro vā paṇītataro vā
natthī’ti vadāmi</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, being such in regard to all phenomena, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, is such. Moreover than he who is such there is
none other higher or more excellent, I declare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most difficult word, here, is <em>tādī</em>. We have already explained it to some
extent. It can be rendered by ‘such’ or ‘thus’. The commentary explains it by
the phrase <em>tāditā nāma ekasadisatā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn823-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn823">17</a></sup> “suchness means to be always
alike”.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, the commentary states <em>Tathāgato ca yādiso lābhādīsu,
tādisova alābhādīsu</em>, “as he is in regard to gain etc., so is the Tathāgata in
regard to loss etc.”. The allusion here is to the eight worldly vicissitudes,
gain/loss, fame/ill-fame, praise/blame, and pleasure/pain.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn824-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn824">18</a></sup></p>
<p>But this explanation is rather misleading, as it ignores a certain deep
dimension of the meaning of the term <em>tādī</em>. When it is said “as he is in regard
to gain, so is he in regard to loss”, one can ask: “how is he in regard to
gain?” This is imprecise as a meaning.</p>
<p>However, the commentator happens to quote from the <em>Mahāniddesa</em> another
explanation, which is more to the point. It is briefly stated as <em>iṭṭhāniṭṭhe
tādī</em>, “such in regard to the desirable and the undesirable”; and explained as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>lābhepi tādī, alābhepi tādī, yasepi tādī, ayasepi tādī, nindāyapi tādī,
pasaṁsāyapi tādī, sukhepi tādī, dukkhepi tādī</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn825-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn825">19</a></sup></p>
<p>he is such in gain as well as in loss, he is such in fame as well as in
ill-fame … etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the correct explanation. Instead of saying “as he is in gain, so is he
in loss”, we have here a continuous suchness in regard to all vicissitudes. He
is such in gain as well as in loss, he is such in fame as well as in ill-fame,
he is such in praise as well as in blame, he is such in pleasure as well as in
pain.</p>
<p>The reason for this suchness we have explained on an earlier occasion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn826-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn826">20</a></sup>
In one sense, the term <em>tādī</em> stands for the understanding of the norm called
<em>tathatā</em>. The other implication is the abstinence from the tendency towards
identification or acquisition, meant by <em>tammayatā</em>. This exemplary trait is
called <em>atammayatā</em>. This is an extremely important term, occurring in the
discourses, which, however, has fallen into neglect at present.</p>
<p>In the case of music, for instance, <em>tammayatā</em> would imply an attachment to it
that amounts to an identification with it. <em>Tammayo</em> means ‘made of that’, as in
<em>suvaṇṇamaya</em>, ‘made of gold’, and <em>rajatamaya</em>, ‘made of silver’. To be free
from this <em>tammayatā</em>, is to be <em>tādī</em>, ‘such’, that is to say, not to be of
that stuff, <em>atammayatā</em>. The attitude of not leaning on or grasping is meant by
it.</p>
<p>The quality of being <em>tādī</em>, or ‘such’, is often rendered by ‘firmness’,
‘steadfastness’, and ‘immovability’. Generally, one associates firmness,
immovability or stability with holding on or leaning on. But here we have just
the contrary. Not to hold on to anything, is to be ‘such’. This suchness has a
flexibility of a higher order, or an adaptability. The adaptability
characteristic of the sage who lives on <em>piṇḍapāta</em>, or alms-food, is
highlighted in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Alatthaṁ yadidaṁ sādhu,</em> <br />
<em>nālatthaṁ kusalām iti,</em> <br />
<em>ubhayeneva so tādī,</em> <br />
<em>rukkhaṁ va upanivattati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn827-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn827">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Suppose I got it, well and good, <br />
Suppose I didn’t get, that’s fine too, <br />
In both circumstances he is such, <br />
And comes back [like one who walks up to a] tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of adaptability and resilience is also implied by the term <em>tādī</em>.
Though the term is sometimes rendered by the word ‘steadfast’, it does not stand
for any rigidity. Instead, it carries implications of a non-rigid resilience.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful quality in <em>tathāgatas</em> and <em>arahants</em>. We may compare it to a
revolving swing in a children’s playground. One who is seated in a revolving
swing has nothing to get upset about falling headlong when the swing goes up.
The seats are hung in such a way that they also turn with the revolving motion
of the swing. Had they been rigidly fixed, one seated there would fall off the
seat when it goes up. It is that kind of resilience that is characteristic of
the quality of <em>tāditā</em>, or ‘suchness’. This is how we have to understand the
famous lines in the <em>Mahāmaṅgalasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Phuṭṭhassa lokadhammehi,</em> <br />
<em>cittam yassa na kampati,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn828-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn828">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Whose mind remains unshaken, <br />
When touched by worldly vicissitudes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quality of being unshaken, this immovability, is the result of not
grasping. It comes when there is no tenacious clinging. It is to one who rests
on or leans on something that there is dislodgement or instability.</p>
<p>Now I am leaning on the wall, if someone does damage to the wall, I would get
shaken, that is what is suggested by the axiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nissitassa calitaṁ, anissitassa calitaṁ natthi</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn829-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn829">23</a></sup></p>
<p>to one who is attached, there is dislodgement, to the one detached, there is
no dislodgement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worldling, on the other hand, thinks that to lean on or to rely on something
is the mark of stability.</p>
<p>So it seems that the term <em>tādī</em> has an extraordinary dimension of meaning. In
this particular context, however, the suchness spoken of does not concern the
eight worldly vicissitudes like gain and loss. Here it carries a special nuance
as is evident from the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññātabbesu dhammesu tādī
yeva tādī.</em></p>
<p>Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, being such in regard to all phenomena, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, is such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suchness here meant is about the views adhered to by the worldlings. In
regard to things seen, heard, sensed and cognized, the worldlings go on
asserting dogmatically <em>idam eva saccaṁ, mogham aññaṁ</em>, “this alone is true, all
else is false”. But the Tathāgata has no such dogmatic involvement. He only
analytically exposes them for what they are.</p>
<p>As we tried to illustrate by the simile of the dog on the plank, the Tathāgata
simply penetrates into their dependently arisen nature and declares that all
those views are dependent on contact, <em>phassapaccayā</em>. That is the <em>tādī</em>
quality meant here.</p>
<p>If we are to understand the plane of suchness, <em>tādībhūmi</em>, in a deeper sense,
this is how we have to appreciate its significance. Now we come to the couplet
forming the grand finale to the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci diṭṭhaṁ va sutaṁ mutaṁ vā,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhositaṁ saccamutaṁ paresaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>na tesu tādī sayasaṁvutesu,</em> <br />
<em>saccaṁ musā vā pi paraṁ daheyyaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Etañca sallaṁ paṭigacca disvā,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhositā yattha pajā visattā,</em> <br />
<em>jānāmi passāmi tath’ eva etaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhositaṁ natthi tathāgatānaṁ.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first verse, we have the difficult term <em>sayasaṁvutesu</em>, which we
rendered by “amidst those who are entrenched in their own views”. The term
carries insinuations of philosophical in-breeding, which often accounts for
dogmatic adherence to views.</p>
<p>The Tathāgata declares that he does not hold as true or false any of the
concepts of individual truths based on what is seen, heard, sensed and cognized
by others, because of his suchness. Being such, he does not categorically label
any of those views as true or false. He penetrates into and analyses the
psychological background of all those dogmatic views and understands them as
such.</p>
<p>In the final verse, he declares that he has seen well in advance “the barb on
which mankind is hooked impaled”. The barb is none other than the dogmatic
assertion, “I know, I see, it is verily so”. Having seen this barb, well in
advance, the Tathāgata entertains no dogmatic involvement of that sort.</p>
<p>The precise meaning of some words and phrases here is a matter of controversy. A
discussion of them might throw more light on their deeper nuances. The most
difficult term seems to be <em>sayasaṁvuta</em>. The commentary gives the following
explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Sayasaṁvutesu’ti ’sayameva saṁvaritvā piyāyitvā gahitagahaṇesu
diṭṭhigatikesū’ti attho. Diṭṭhigatikā hi ’sayaṁ saṁvutā’ti vuccanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn830-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn830">24</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sayasaṁvutesu</em> means among those dogmatic view-holders, who have grasped
those views, having recollected them and cherished them. Dogmatic view-holders
are called <em>sayasaṁvuta</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the commentary, the term <em>sayasaṁvuta</em> refers to persons who hold
dogmatic views. But we interpreted it as a reference to such views themselves.</p>
<p>By way of clarification, we may allude to some discourses in the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em>
of the <em>Suttanipāta</em>, which bring up a wealth of material to substantiate the
salient points in the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>, while throwing more light on the
particular term in question.</p>
<p>The chapter called <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> in the <em>Suttanipāta</em> in particular embodies a
deep analysis of the controversies among contemporary dogmatists.</p>
<p>Let us, first of all, take up for comment some verses that throw more light on
the meaning of the term <em>sayasaṁvuta</em> from the <em>Cūḷaviyūhasutta</em>. That discourse
unfolds itself in the form of question and answer. The commentary explains, that
this medium of dialogue was adopted by the Buddha to resolve the clash of
philosophical moot points current in the society, and that the interlocutor is a
replica of the Buddha himself, created by his psychic power.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn831-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn831">25</a></sup> Be that as
it may, the relevant question for the present context is presented as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kasmā nu saccāni vadanti nānā,</em> <br />
<em>pavādiyāse kusalā vadānā,</em> <br />
<em>saccāni su tāni bahūni nānā,</em> <br />
<em>udāhu te takkam anussaranti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn832-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn832">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Why do they proclaim various truths, <br />
Claiming to be experts each in his field, <br />
Are there several and various truths, <br />
Or do they merely follow logical consistency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s reply to it is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na h’eva saccāni bahūni nānā,</em> <br />
<em>aññatra saññāya niccāni loke,</em> <br />
<em>takkañ ca diṭṭhīsu pakappayitvā,</em> <br />
<em>’saccaṁ musā’ti dvayadhammam āhu.</em></p>
<p>There are no several and various truths, <br />
That are permanent in the world, apart from perception, <br />
It is by manipulating logic in speculative views, <br />
That they speak of two things called ‘truth and falsehood’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no plurality in the concept of truth, apart from the perception based
on which they declare various speculative views. It seems that the Buddha grants
the possibility of various levels of perception as a truth for all times, though
he does not accept a plurality of truths, arising out of a variety of
speculative views based on them.</p>
<p>He understands the psychology of logic, having seen penetratively the perceptual
background of each and every view. He accepts as a psychological fact that such
and such a perception could precipitate such and such a view. Therefore, in a
limited or relative sense, they are ‘true’.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between truth and falsehood has arisen in the world due to a
manipulation of logic on individual viewpoints. This fact comes up for further
comment in the <em>Mahāviyūhasutta</em> that follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sakaṁ hi dhammaṁ paripuṇṇam āhu,</em> <br />
<em>aññasssa dhammaṁ pana hīnaṁ āhu,</em> <br />
<em>evam pi viggayha vivādiyanti,</em> <br />
<em>sakaṁ sakaṁ sammutim āhu sacaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn833-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn833">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse describes how debating parties go on clashing with each other. They
call their own system of thought perfect, and the other system of thought
inferior. Thus they quarrel and dispute. Their own individual viewpoint they
assert as true. The phrase <em>sakaṁ sakaṁ sammutim</em>, “each his own viewpoint”, is
somewhat suggestive of <em>sayasaṁvutesu</em>, the problematic term in the
<em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Yet another verse from the <em>Pasūrasutta</em> in the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> exposes the
biases and prejudices underlying these individual truths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Idh’eva suddhi’ iti vādiyanti,</em> <br />
<em>nāññesu dhammesu visuddhim āhu,</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ nissitā tattha subhaṁ vadānā,</em> <br />
<em>paccekasaccesu puthū niviṭṭhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn834-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn834">28</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Here in this system is purity’, they assert polemically, <br />
They are not prepared to grant purity <br />
<span class="vin"></span> in other systems of thought, <br />
Whatever view they lean on, that they speak in praise of, <br />
They are severally entrenched in their own individual truths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last line is particularly relevant, as it brings up the concept of
<em>paccekasacca</em>. To be a <em>Paccekabuddha</em> means to be enlightened for oneself. So
the term <em>paccekasacca</em> can mean ‘truth for oneself’. Those who hold conflicting
views go on debating entrenched each in his own concept of truth.</p>
<p>The three expressions <em>pacekasacca, sakaṁ sakaṁ sammutim</em> and <em>sayasaṁvutesu</em>
convey more or less the same idea. The words <em>tesu sayasaṁvutesu</em> refer to those
narrow viewpoints to which they are individually confined, or remain closeted
in. The Tathāgata does not hold as true or false any of those views limited by
the self-bias.</p>
<p>Another lapse in the commentary to the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> is its comment on the
phrase <em>paraṁ daheyyaṁ</em>. It takes the word <em>paraṁ</em> in the sense of ‘supreme’,
<em>uttamaṁ katvā</em>, whereas in this context it means ‘the other’. Here, too, we may
count on the following two lines of the <em>Cūḷaviyūhasutta</em> of the <em>Suttanipāta</em>
in support of our interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yen’ eva ’bālo’ti paraṁ dahāti,</em> <br />
<em>tenātumānaṁ ’kusalo’ti cāha.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn835-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn835">29</a></sup></p>
<p>That by which one dubs the other a fool, <br />
By that itself one calls oneself an expert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is clear that the phrase <em>paraṁ dahāti</em> means ‘dubs another’. The
last two lines of the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> are of utmost importance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jānāmi passāmi tath’ eva etaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhositaṁ natthi tathāgatānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>I know I see, it is verily so, <br />
No such clinging for the <em>tathāgatas</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldlings dogmatically grasp the data heaped up by their six sense-bases, but
the <em>tathāgatas</em> have no such entanglements in regard to sensory knowledge. Why
so? It is because they have seen the cessation of the six sense-bases.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, we may compare this seeing of the cessation of the six
sense-bases to an exposure of the inner mechanism of a high-speed engine by
removing the bonnet. In the <em>Dvayamsutta</em>, from which we quoted in our last
sermon, the Buddha showed us the functioning of the gigantic machine called the
six-fold sense-base, its vibrations, revolutions, beats and running gears. The
discourse analyses the mechanism in such words as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhu aniccaṁ vipariṇāmi aññathābhāvi. Rūpā aniccā vipariṇāmino
aññathābhāvino. Itthetaṁ dvayaṁ calañceva vyayañca aniccaṁ vipariṇāmi
aññathābhāvi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn836-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn836">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Forms are impermanent,
changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is unstable, evanescent,
impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discourse proceeds in this vein and concludes with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Phuṭṭho, bhikkhave, vedeti, phuṭṭho ceteti, phuṭṭho sañjānāti. Itthete pi
dhammā calā ceva vayā ca aniccā vipariṇāmino aññathābhāvino.</em></p>
<p>Contacted, monks, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives.
Thus these things, too, are unstable, evanescent, impermanent, changing and
becoming otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concluding reference is to the products of the six sense-bases. Feelings,
intentions and perceptions, arising due to contact, are also unstable,
evanescent, impermanent, changing and becoming otherwise.</p>
<p>The sum total of percepts is indicated by the words <em>diṭṭha suta muta</em> and
<em>viññāta</em>. The totality of percepts are made up or ‘prepared’, <em>saṅkhata</em>. The
term <em>saṅkhata</em> has nuances suggestive of ‘production’. If we take the six-fold
sense-base as a high-speed machine, productive of perceptions, the Buddha has
revealed to us the workings of its intricate machinery. Each and every part of
this machine is unstable, evanescent, impermanent, changing and becoming
otherwise.</p>
<p>The Buddha understood the made up or prepared nature, <em>saṅkhata</em>, of all these,
as well as the preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, that go into it. That is why the Buddha
has no dogmatic involvement in regard to the products of this machine, the
totality of all what is seen, heard, sensed and cognized, <em>diṭṭha suta muta
viññāta.</em> None of them is substantial. They are essenceless and insubstantial.
There is nothing worthwhile grasping here as apart from the activities or
preparations that are dynamic in themselves.</p>
<p>So far we have tried to understand the state of affairs with reference to this
discourse. But now let us take up a canonical simile that facilitates our
understanding. The Buddha has compared consciousness to a magic show in the
<em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamasutta</em> of the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> we had already cited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamaṁ rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>vedanā bubbuḷūpamā,</em> <br />
<em>marīcikūpamā saññā,</em> <br />
<em>saṅkhārā kadalūpamā,</em> <br />
<em>māyūpamañca viññāṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpitādiccabandhunā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn837-1"><a href="sermon-25.html#fn-fn837">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Form is like a mass of foam, <br />
And feeling but an airy bubble, <br />
Perception is like a mirage, <br />
And formations a banana trunk, <br />
Consciousness is a magic show [a juggler’s trick entire], <br />
[All these similes] were made known by the kinsman of the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, the verse itself is a mnemonic summary of a certain sermon
delivered by the Buddha. According to it, the Buddha, the kinsman of the sun,
has compared form to a mass of foam, feeling to a water bubble, perception to a
mirage, preparations to a banana trunk, and consciousness to a magic show.</p>
<p>What is of relevance to us here is the comparison of consciousness to a magic
show. The simile of the magic show is presented in that sutta in the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, māyākāro vā māyākārantevāsī vā cātummahāpathe māyaṁ
vidaṁseyya. Tam enaṁ cakkhumā puriso passeyya nijjhāyeyya yoniso
upaparikkheyya. Tassa taṁ passato nijjhāyato yoniso upaparikkhato rittakaññeva
khāyeyya tucchakaññeva khāyeyya asārakaññeva khāyeyya. Kiñhi siyā, bhikkhave,
māyāya sāro?</em></p>
<p><em>Evam eva kho, bhikkhave, yaṁ kiñci viññāṇaṁ atītānāgatapaccuppannaṁ,
ajjhattaṁ vā bahiddhā vā, oḷārikaṁ vā sukhumaṁ vā, hīnaṁ vā paṇītaṁ vā, yaṁ
dūre santike vā, taṁ bhikkhu passati nijjhāyati yoniso upaparikkhati. Tassa
taṁ passato nijjhāyato yoniso upaparikkhato rittakaññeva khāyati tucchakaññeva
khāyati asārakaññeva khāyati. Kiñhi siyā, bhikkhave, viññāṇe sāro?</em></p>
<p>Suppose, monks, a magician or a magician’s apprentice should hold a magic show
at the four cross-roads and a keen-sighted man should see it, ponder over it
and reflect on it radically. Even as he sees it, ponders over it and reflects
on it radically, he would find it empty, he would find it hollow, he would
find it void of essence. What essence, monks, could there be in a magic show?</p>
<p>Even so, monks, whatever consciousness, be it past, future or present, in
oneself or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, a
monks sees it, ponders over it and reflects on it radically. And even as he
sees it, ponders over it and reflects on it radically, he finds it empty, he
finds it hollow, he finds it void of essence. What essence, monks, could there
be in a consciousness?</p>

<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-sixth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Even from what we have so far explained, it should be clear that the
<em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> enshrines an extremely deep analysis of the concepts of truth
and falsehood, generally accepted by the world. We had to clear up a lot of
jungle to approach this discourse, which has suffered from neglect to such an
extent, that it has become difficult to determine the correct one out of a maze
of variant readings.</p>
<p>But now we have exposed the basic ideas underlying this discourse through
semantic and etymological explanations, which may even appear rather academic.
The task before us now is to assimilate the deep philosophy the Buddha presents
to the world by this discourse in a way that it becomes a vision.</p>
<p>The Tathāgata who had an insight into the interior mechanism of the six-fold
sense-base, which is the factory for producing dogmatic views that are beaten up
on the anvil of logic, <em>takkapariyāhata</em>, was confronted with the problem of
mediation with the worldlings, who see only the exterior of the six-fold
sense-base.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the understanding of the gravity of this problem, we
quoted the other day an extract from the <em>Pheṇapiṇḍūpamasutta</em> of the
<em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> where consciousness is compared to a magical illusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, māyākāro vā māyākārantevāsī vā cātummahāpathe māyaṁ
vidaṁseyya, tam enaṁ cakkhumā puriso passeyya nijjhāyeyya yoniso

<p>Suppose, monks, a magician or a magician’s apprentice should hold a magic show
at the four crossroads and a keen sighted man should see it, ponder over it
and reflect on it radically. Even as he sees it, ponders over it and reflects
on it radically, he would find it empty, he would find it hollow, he would
find it void of essence. What essence, monks, could there be in a magic show?</p>
<p>Even so, monks, whatever consciousness, be it past, future or present, in
oneself or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, a
monk sees it, ponders over it and reflects on it radically. Even as he sees
it, ponders over it and reflects on it radically, he would find it empty, he
would find it hollow, he would find it void of essence. What essence, monks,
could there be in consciousness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for the Buddha, consciousness is comparable to a magic show. This is a most
extraordinary exposition, not to be found in any other philosophical system,
because the soul theory tries to sit pretty on consciousness when all other
foundations are shattered. But then, even this citadel itself the Buddha has
described in this discourse as essenceless and hollow, as a magical illusion.
Let us now try to clarify for ourselves the full import of this simile of the
magic show.</p>
<p>A certain magician is going to hold a magic show in some hall or theatre. Among
those who have come to see the magic show, there is a witty person with the
wisdom eye, who tells himself: “Today I must see the magic show inside out!”</p>
<p>With this determination he hides himself in a corner of the stage, unseen by
others. When the magic show starts, this person begins to discover, before long,
the secrets of the magician, his deceitful stock-in-trade – counterfeits, hidden
strings and buttons, secret pockets and false bottoms in his magic boxes. He
observes clearly all the secret gadgets that the audience is unaware of. With
this vision, he comes to the conclusion that there is no magic in any of those
gadgets.</p>
<p>Some sort of disenchantment sets in. Now he has no curiosity, amazement, fright
or amusement that he used to get whenever he watched those magic shows. Instead
he now settles into a mood of equanimity. Since there is nothing more for him to
see in the magic show, he mildly turns his attention towards the audience. Then
he sees the contrast. The entire hall is a sea of craned necks, gaping mouths
and goggle-eyes with ‘Ahs’ and ‘Ohs’ and whistles of speechless amazement. At
this sorry sight, he even feels remorseful that he himself was in this same
plight before. So in this way he sees through the magic show – an ‘insight’
instead of a ‘sight’.</p>
<p>When the show ends, he steps out of the hall and tries to slink away unseen. But
he runs into a friend of his, who also was one of the spectators. Now he has to
listen to a vivid commentary on the magic show. His friend wants him to join in
his appreciation, but he listens through with equanimity. Puzzled by this
strange reserved attitude, the friend asks:</p>
<p>“Why, you were in the same hall all this time, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was.”</p>
<p>“Then were you sleeping?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t watching closely, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I was watching it all right, maybe I was watching too closely.”</p>
<p>“You say you were watching, but you don’t seem to have seen the show.”</p>
<p>“No, I saw it. In fact I saw it so well that I missed the show.”</p>
<p>The above dialogue between the man who watched the show with discernment and the
one who watched with naive credulity should give a clue to the riddle-like
proclamations of the Buddha in the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>. The Buddha also was
confronted with the same problematic situation after his enlightenment, which
was an insight into the magic show of consciousness.</p>
<p>That man with discernment hid himself in a corner of the stage to get that
insight. The Buddha also had to hide in some corner of the world stage for his
enlightenment. The term <em>paṭisallāna</em>, ‘solitude’, has a nuance suggestive of a
hide-away. It is in such a hide-away that the Buddha witnessed the interior of
the six-fold sense-base. The reason for his equanimity towards conflicting views
about truth and falsehood in the world, as evidenced by this discourse, is the
very insight into the six sense-bases.</p>
<p>First of all, let us try to compare our parable with the discourse proper. Now
the Buddha declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ
pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā, tam ahaṁ jānāmi.</em></p>
<p><em>Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ
pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā, tam ahaṁ abhaññāsiṁ. Taṁ tathāgatasssa
viditaṁ, taṁ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn840-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn840">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is seen,
heard, sensed, cognized, sought after and pondered over by the mind, all that
do I know.</p>
<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world, with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is seen,
heard, sensed, cognized, sought after and pondered over by the mind, that have
I fully understood. All that is known to the Tathāgata, but the Tathāgata has
not taken his stand upon it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha does not stop after saying that he knows all that, but goes on
to declare that he has fully understood all that and that it is known to the
Tathāgata. The implication is that he has seen through all that and discovered
their vanity, hollowness and essencelessness. That is to say, he not only knows,
but he has grown wiser. In short, he has seen the magic show so well as to miss
the show.</p>
<p>Unlike in the case of those worldly spectators, the released mind of the
Tathāgata did not find anything substantial in the magic show of consciousness.
That is why he refused to take his stand upon the sense-data, <em>taṁ tathāgato na
upaṭṭhāsi</em>, “the Tathāgata has not taken his stand upon it”. In contrast to the
worldly philosophers, the <em>tathāgatas</em> have no entanglement with all that,
<em>ajjhositaṁ natthi tathāgatānaṁ.</em></p>
<p>The dialogue we have given might highlight these distinctions regarding levels
of knowledge. It may also throw more light on the concluding statement that
forms the gist of the discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ na maññati, adiṭṭhaṁ
na maññati, daṭṭhabbaṁ na maññati, daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati. Sutā sotabbaṁ sutaṁ
na maññati, asutaṁ na maññati, sotabbaṁ na maññati, sotāraṁ na maññati. Mutā
motabbaṁ mutaṁ na maññati, amutaṁ na maññati, motabbaṁ na maññati, motāraṁ na
maññati. Viññātā viññātabbaṁ viññātaṁ na maññati, aviññātaṁ na maññati,
viññātabbaṁ na maññati, viññātāraṁ na maññati.</em></p>
<p>Thus, monks, a Tathāgata does not imagine a visible thing as apart from
seeing, he does not imagine an unseen, he does not imagine a thing worth
seeing, he does not imagine a seer. He does not imagine an audible thing as
apart from hearing, he does not imagine an unheard, he does not imagine a
thing worth hearing, he does not imagine a hearer. He does not imagine a thing
to be sensed as apart from sensation, he does not imagine an unsensed, he does
not imagine a thing worth sensing, he does not imagine one who senses. He does
not imagine a cognizable thing as apart from cognition, he does not imagine an
uncognized, he does not imagine a thing worth cognizing, he does not imagine
one who cognizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is like the hesitation of that man with discernment who, on coming out of the
hall, found it difficult to admit categorically that he had seen the magic show.
Since the Tathāgata had an insight into the mechanism of the six-fold
sense-base, that is to say, its conditioned nature, he understood that there is
no one to see and nothing to see – only a seeing is there.</p>
<p>The dictum of the <em>Bāhiyasutta</em> “in the seen just the seen”, <em>diṭṭhe
diṭṭhamattaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn841-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn841">4</a></sup> which we cited the other day, becomes more meaningful
now. Only a seeing is there. Apart from the fact of having seen, there is
nothing substantial to see. There is no magic to see. <em>Diṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṁ diṭṭhaṁ
na maññati,</em> he does not imagine a sight worthwhile apart from the seen. There
is no room for a conceit of having seen a magic show.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is not possible to deny the fact of seeing, <em>adiṭṭhaṁ na
maññati</em>. He does not imagine an unseen. Now that friend was curious whether
this one was asleep during the magic show, but that was not the case either.</p>
<p><em>Daṭṭhabbaṁ na maññati</em>, the Tathāgata does not imagine a thing worthwhile
seeing. The equanimity of that witty man was so much that he turned away from
the bogus magic show to have a look at the audience below. This way we can
understand how the Tathāgata discovered that there is only a seen but nothing
worthwhile seeing.</p>
<p>Likewise the phrase <em>daṭṭhāraṁ na maññati</em>, he does not imagine a seer, could
also be understood in the light of this parable. All those who came out of that
hall, except this discerning one, were spectators. He was not one of the
audience, because he had an insight into the magic show from his hiding place on
the stage.</p>
<p>The statement <em>tam ahaṁ ’na jānāmī’ti vadeyyaṁ, taṁ mama assa musā</em>, “if I were
to say, that I do not know, it would be a falsehood in me”, could similarly be
appreciated in the light of the dialogue after the magic show.</p>
<p>The discerning one could not say that he was not aware of what was going on,
because he was fully awake during the magic show. Nor can he say that he was
aware of it in the ordinary sense. An affirmation or negation of both
standpoints would be out of place. This gives us a clue to understand the two
statements of the Tathāgata to the effect that he is unable to say that he both
knows and does not know, <em>jānāmi ca na ca jānāmi</em>, and neither knows nor does
not know, <em>n’eva jānāmi na na jānāmi</em>.</p>
<p>All this is the result of his higher understanding, indicated by the word
<em>abhaññāsiṁ</em>. The Tathāgata saw the magic show of consciousness so well as to
miss the show, from the point of view of the worldlings.</p>
<p>Now we come to the conclusive declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭha-suta-muta-viññātabbesu dhammesu tādī
yeva tādī, tamhā ca pana tādimhā añño tādī uttaritaro vā paṇītataro vā
natthī’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, being such in regard to all phenomena, seen,
heard, sensed and cognized, is such. Moreover than he who is such there is
none other higher or more excellent, I declare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other day we discussed the implications of the term <em>tādī</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn842-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn842">5</a></sup> The term
is usually explained as signifying the quality of remaining unshaken before the
eight worldly vicissitudes. But in this context, it has a special significance.
It implies an equanimous attitude towards dogmatic views and view-holders. This
attitude avoids categorical affirmation or negation regarding the question of
truth and falsehood. It grants a relative reality to those viewpoints.</p>
<p>This is the moral behind the hesitation to give clear-cut answers to that
inquisitive friend in our pithy dialogue. It is not the outcome of a dilly-dally
attitude. There is something really deep. It is the result of an insight into
the magic show. The reason for this suchness is the understanding of the norm of
dependent arising, known as <em>tathatā</em>.</p>
<p>It is obvious from the expositions of the norm of dependent arising that there
are two aspects involved, namely, <em>anuloma</em>, direct order, and <em>paṭiloma</em>,
indirect order.</p>
<p>The direct order is to be found in the first half of the twelve linked formula,
beginning with the word <em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā</em>, “dependent on ignorance,
preparations”, while the indirect order is given in the second half with the
words, <em>avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā</em> etc., “with the remainderless fading
away and cessation of ignorance” etc.</p>
<p>The implication is that where there is ignorance, aggregates of grasping get
accumulated, which, in other words, is a heaping up of suffering. That is a
fact. But then, when ignorance fades away and ceases, they do not get
accumulated.</p>
<p>Now, with this magic show as an illustration, we can get down to a deeper
analysis of the law of dependent arising. In a number of earlier sermons, we
have already made an attempt to explain a certain deep dimension of this law,
with the help of illustrations from the dramatic and cinematographic fields. The
magic show we have brought up now is even more striking as an illustration.</p>
<p>In the case of the cinema, the background of darkness we compared to the
darkness of ignorance. Because of the surrounding darkness, those who go to the
cinema take as real whatever they see on the screen and create for themselves
various moods and emotions.</p>
<p>In the case of the magic show, the very ignorance of the tricks of the magician
is what accounts for the apparent reality of the magic performance. Once the
shroud of ignorance is thrown off, the magic show loses its magic for the
audience. The magician’s secret stock-in-trade gave rise to the <em>saṅkhāras</em> or
preparations with the help of which the audience created for themselves a magic
show.</p>
<p>To that discerning man, who viewed the show from his hiding place on the stage,
there were no such preparations. That is why he proverbially missed the show.</p>
<p>The same principle holds good in the case of the magical illusion, <em>māyā</em>, that
is consciousness. A clear instance of this is the reference in the
<em>Mahāvedallasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> to <em>viññāṇa</em>, consciousness, and
<em>paññā</em>, wisdom, as two conjoined psychological states.</p>
<p>They cannot be separated one from the other, <em>saṁsaṭṭhā no visaṁsaṭṭhā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn843-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn843">6</a></sup>
But they can be distinguished functionally. Out of them, wisdom is to be
developed, while consciousness is to be comprehended, <em>paññā bhāvetabbā,
viññāṇaṁ pariññeyyaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>The development of wisdom is for the purpose of comprehending consciousness and
comprehended consciousness proves to be empty, essenceless and hollow. It is
such a transformation that took place within the person who watched the magic
show with discernment. He watched it too closely, so much so, that the
preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, in the form of the secret stock-in-trade of the
magician, became ineffective and nugatory.</p>
<p>This makes clear the connection between ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, and preparations,
<em>saṅkhārā</em>. That is why ignorance takes precedence in the formula of dependent
arising. Preparations owe their effectiveness to ignorance. They are dependent
on ignorance. To understand preparations for what they are is knowledge.
Simultaneous with the arising of that knowledge, preparations become mere
preparations, or pure preparations, <em>suddha saṅkhārā</em>.</p>
<p>This gives us the clue to unravel the meaning of the verse in the <em>Adhimutta
Theragāthā</em>, quoted earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suddhaṁ dhammasamuppādaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>suddhaṁ saṅkhārasantatiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passantassa yathābhūtaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>na bhayaṁ hoti gāmani.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn844-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn844">7</a></sup></p>
<p>To one who sees <br />
The arising of pure <em>dhammas</em> <br />
And the sequence of pure preparations, as they are, <br />
There is no fear, oh headman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a limited sense, we can say that graspings relating to a magic show did not
get accumulated in the mind of that discerning person, while his friend was
gathering them eagerly. The latter came out of the hall as if coming out of the
magic world. He had been amassing graspings proper to a magic world due to his
ignorance of those preparations.</p>
<p>From this one may well infer that if at any point of time consciousness is
comprehended by wisdom, preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, become mere preparations, or
pure preparations. Being influx-free, they do not go to build up a prepared,
<em>saṅkhata</em>. They do not precipitate an amassing of grasping, <em>upādāna</em>, to bring
about an existence, <em>bhava.</em> This amounts to a release from existence.</p>
<p>One seems to be in the world, but one is not of the world. That man with
discernment was in the hall all that time, but it was as if he was not there.</p>
<p>Let us now go deeper into the implications of the term <em>tādī</em>, ‘such’, with
reference to the law of dependent arising, known as <em>tathatā</em>, ‘suchness’. From
the dialogue that followed the magic show, it is clear that there are two points
of view. We have here a question of two different points of view. If we are to
explain these two viewpoints with reference to the law of dependent arising, we
may allude to the distinction made for instance in the <em>Nidāna Saṁyutta</em> between
the basic principle of dependent arising and the phenomena dependently arisen.
We have already cited the relevant declaration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppādañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi paṭiccasamuppanne ca
dhamme.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn845-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn845">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I shall preach to you dependent arising and things that are dependently
arisen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes two significant terms are used to denote these two aspects, namely
<em>hetu</em> and <em>hetusamuppannā dhammā</em>.</p>
<p>About the <em>ariyan</em> disciple, be he even a stream-winner, it is said that his
understanding of dependent arising covers both these aspects, <em>hetu ca sudiṭṭho
hetusamuppannā ca dhammā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn846-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn846">9</a></sup> The cause, as well as the things arisen from
a cause, are well seen or understood by him.</p>
<p>As we pointed out in our discussion of the hill-top festival in connection with
the Upatissa and Kolita episode,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn847-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn847">10</a></sup> the disenchantment with the hill-top
festival served as a setting for their encounter with the venerable Assaji. As
soon as venerable Assaji uttered the significant pithy verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā,</em> <br />
<em>tesaṁ hetuṁ tathāgato āha,</em> <br />
<em>tesañca yo nirodho,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ vādī mahāsamaṇo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn848-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn848">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Of things that proceed from a cause, <br />
Their cause the Tathāgata has told, <br />
And also their cessation, <br />
Thus teaches the great ascetic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wandering ascetic Upatissa, who was to become venerable Sāriputta later,
grasped the clue to the entire <em>saṁsāric</em> riddle then and there, and discovered
the secret of the magic show of consciousness, even by the first two lines. That
was because he excelled in wisdom.</p>
<p>As soon as he heard the lines “of things that proceed from a cause, their cause
the Tathāgata has told”, he understood the basic principle of dependent arising,
<em>yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>, “whatever is of a nature
to arise, all that is of a nature to cease”. The wandering ascetic Kolita,
however, became a stream-winner only on hearing all four lines.</p>
<p>This pithy verse has been variously interpreted. But the word <em>hetu</em> in this
verse has to be understood as a reference to the law of dependent arising. When
asked what <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is, the usual answer is a smattering of the
twelve-linked formula in direct and reverse order. The most important normative
prefatory declaration is ignored:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa uppādā idaṁ upajjati,</em> <br />
<em>imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati.</em></p>
<p>This being, this comes to be; <br />
With the arising of this, this arises; <br />
This not being, this does not come to be; <br />
With the cessation of this, this ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement of the basic principle of dependent arising is very often
overlooked. It is this basic principle that finds expression in that pithy
verse.</p>
<p>The line <em>ye dhammā hetuppabhavā</em>, “of things that proceed from a cause”, is
generally regarded as a reference to the first link <em>avijjā</em>. But this is not
the case. All the twelve links are dependently arisen, and <em>avijjā</em> is no
exception. Even ignorance arises with the arising of influxes, <em>āsavasamudayā
avijjāsamudayo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn849-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn849">12</a></sup> Here we have something extremely deep.</p>
<p>The allusion here is to the basic principle couched in the phrases <em>imasmiṁ sati
idaṁ hoti</em> etc. In such discourses as the <em>Bahudhātukasutta</em> the twelve-linked
formula is introduced with a set of these thematic phrases, which is then
related to the formula proper with the conjunctive “that is to say”,
<em>yadidaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn850-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn850">13</a></sup></p>
<p>This conjunctive clearly indicates that the twelve-linked formula is an
illustration. The twelve links are therefore things dependently arisen, <em>paṭicca
samuppannā dhammā</em>. They are all arisen from a cause, <em>hetuppabhavā dhammā</em>.</p>
<p>So even ignorance is not the cause. The cause is the underlying principle
itself. This being, this comes to be. With the arising of this, this arises.
This not being, this does not come to be. With the cessation of this, this
ceases. This is the norm, the suchness, <em>tathatā</em>, that the Buddha discovered.</p>
<p>That man with discernment at the magic show, looking down at the audience with
commiseration, had a similar sympathetic understanding born of realization: “I
too have been in this same sorry plight before”.</p>
<p>Due to ignorance, a sequence of phenomena occurs, precipitating a heaping of
graspings. With the cessation of ignorance, all that comes to cease. It is by
seeing this cessation that the momentous inner transformation took place. The
insight into this cessation brings about the realization that all what the
worldlings take as absolutely true, permanent or eternal, are mere phenomena
arisen from the mind. <em>Manopubbangamā dhammā</em>, mind is the forerunner of all
mind-objects.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn851-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn851">14</a></sup> One comes to understand that all what is arisen is bound
to cease, and that the cessation can occur here and now.</p>
<p>In discussing the formula of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, the arising of the six
sense-bases is very often explained with reference to a mother’s womb. It is the
usual practice to interpret such categories as <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, name-and-form, and
<em>saḷāyatana</em>, six sense-bases, purely in physiological terms. But for the Buddha
the arising of the six sense-bases was not a stage in the growth of a foetus in
the mother’s womb.</p>
<p>It was through wisdom that he saw the six bases of sense-contact arising then
and there, according to the formula beginning with <em>cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca
uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ</em>, “dependent on eye and forms arises eye-consciousness”
etc. They are of a nature of arising and ceasing, like that magic show.
Everything in the world is of a nature to arise and cease.</p>
<p>The words <em>ye dhammā hetuppabhavā</em>, “of things that proceed from a cause” etc.,
is an enunciation of that law. Any explanation of the law of dependent arising
should rightly begin with the basic principle <em>imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> “this
being, this comes to be” etc.</p>
<p>This confusion regarding the way of explaining <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is a case of
missing the wood for the trees. It is as if the Buddha stretches his arm and
says: “That is a forest”, and one goes and catches hold of a tree, exclaiming:
“Ah, this is the forest”. To rattle off the twelve links in the hope of grasping
the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is like counting the number of trees in order to
see the forest.</p>
<p>The subtlest point here is the basic principle involved. “This being, this comes
to be. With the arising of this, this arises. This not being, this does not come
to be. With the cessation of this, this ceases”.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the connection between the law of dependent arising, <em>paṭicca
samuppāda</em>, and things dependently arisen, <em>paṭiccasamuppannā dhammā</em>.</p>
<p>Worldings do not even understand things dependently arisen as ‘dependently
arisen’. They are fully involved in them. That itself is <em>saṁsāra</em>. One who has
seen the basic principle of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> understands the dictum,
<em>avijjāya sati saṅkhārā honti</em>, preparations are there only when ignorance is
there.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn852-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn852">15</a></sup> So he neither grasps ignorance, nor does he grasp preparations.</p>
<p>In fact, to dwell on the law of dependent arising is the way to liberate the
mind from the whole lot of dependently arisen things. Now why do we say so?
Everyone of those twelve links, according to the Buddha, is impermanent,
prepared, dependently arisen, of a nature to wither away, wear away, fade away
and cease, <em>aniccaṁ, saṅkhataṁ, paṭicca samuppannaṁ, khayadhammaṁ, vayadhammaṁ,
virāgadhammaṁ, nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn853-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn853">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The very first link <em>avijjā</em> is no exception. They are impermanent because they
are made up or prepared, <em>saṅkhata</em>. The term <em>saṅkhataṁ</em> has nuances of
artificiality and spuriousness. All the links are therefore unreal in the
highest sense. They are dependent on contact, <em>phassa</em>, and therefore
dependently arisen. It is in their nature to wither away, wear away, fade away
and cease.</p>
<p>When one has understood this as a fact of experience, one brings one’s mind to
rest, not on the things dependently arisen, but on the law of dependent arising
itself.</p>
<p>There is something extraordinary about this. One must not miss the wood for the
trees. When the Buddha stretches his arm and says: “That is a forest”, he does
not expect us to go and grasp any of the trees, or to go on counting them, so as
to understand what a forest is. One has to get a synoptic view of it from here
itself. Such a view takes into account not only the trees, but also the
intervening spaces between them, all at one synoptic glance.</p>
<p>In order to get a correct understanding of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> from a pragmatic
point of view, one has to bring one’s mind to rest on the norm that obtains
between every two links. But this is something extremely difficult, because the
world is steeped in the notion of duality. It grasps either this end, or the
other end. Hard it is for the world to understand the stance of the <em>arahant</em>
couched in the cryptic phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nev’idha na huraṁ na ubhayam antare</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn854-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn854">17</a></sup></p>
<p>neither here nor there nor in between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worldling is accustomed to grasp either this end or the other end. For
instance, one may grasp either ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, or preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>.
But here we have neither. When one dwells on the interrelation between them, one
is at least momentarily free from ignorance as well as from the delusive nature
of preparations.</p>
<p>Taking the magic show itself as an illustration, let us suppose that the
magician is performing a trick, which earlier appeared as a miracle. But now
that one sees the counterfeits, hidden strings and secret bottoms, one is aware
of the fact that the magical effect is due to the evocative nature of those
preparations. So he does not take seriously those preparations. His ignorance is
thereby reduced to the same extent.</p>
<p>This is how each of those links gets worn out, as the phrase <em>khayadhammaṁ,
vayadhammaṁ, virāgadhammaṁ, nirodhadhammaṁ</em> suggests. All the links are of a
nature to wither away, wear away, fade away and cease. So, then, preparations
are there only when ignorance is there. The preparations are effective only so
long as ignorance is there. With the arising of ignorance, preparations arise.
When ignorance is not there, preparations lose their provenance. With the
complete fading away and cessation of ignorance, preparations, too, fade away
and cease without residue. This, then, is the relationship between those two
links.</p>
<p>Let us go for another instance to illustrate this point further.
<em>Saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṁ</em>, “dependent on preparations is consciousness”.
Generally, the worldlings are prone to take consciousness as a compact unit.
They regard it as their self or soul. When everything else slips out from their
grasp, they grasp consciousness as their soul, because it is invisible.</p>
<p>Now if someone is always aware that consciousness arises dependent on
preparations, that with the arising of preparations consciousness arises –
always specific and never abstract – consciousness ceases to appear as a
monolithic whole.</p>
<p>This particular eye-consciousness has arisen because of eye and forms. This
particular ear-consciousness has arisen because of ear and sound, and so on.
This kind of reflection and constant awareness of the part played by
preparations in the arising of consciousness will conduce to the withering away,
wearing away and fading away of consciousness. Disgust, disillusionment and
dejection in regard to consciousness is what accounts for its complete
cessation, sooner or later.</p>
<p>Consciousness is dependent on preparations, and name-and-form, <em>nāma-rūpa</em>, is
dependent on consciousness. The worldling does not even recognize <em>nāma-rūpa</em> as
such. We have already analyzed the mutual relationship between name-and-form as
a reciprocity between nominal form and formal name.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn855-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn855">18</a></sup> They always go
together and appear as a reflection on consciousness. Here is a case of
entanglement within and an entanglement without, <em>anto jaṭā bahi jaṭā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn856-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn856">19</a></sup></p>
<p>We brought in a simile of a dog on a plank to illustrate the involvement with
name-and-form. When one understands that this name-and-form, which the world
takes as real and calls one’s own, is a mere reflection on consciousness, one
does not grasp it either.</p>
<p>To go further, when one attends to the fact that the six sense-bases are
dependent on name-and-form, and that they are there only as long as
name-and-form is there, and that with the cessation of name-and-form the six
sense-bases also cease, one is attuning one’s mind to the law of dependent
arising, thereby weaning one’s mind away from its hold on dependently arisen
things.</p>
<p>Similarly, contact arises in dependence on the six sense-bases. Generally, the
world is enslaved by contact. In the <em>Nandakovādasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>
there is a highly significant dictum, stressing the specific character of
contact as such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tajjaṁ tajjaṁ, bhante, paccayaṁ paṭicca tajjā tajjā vedanā uppajjanti;
tajjassa tajjassa paccayassa nirodhā tajjā tajjā vedanā nirujjhanti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn857-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn857">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Dependent on each specific condition, venerable sir, specific feelings arise,
and with the cessation of each specific condition, specific feelings cease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The understanding that contact is dependent on the six sense-bases enables one
to overcome the delusion arising out of contact. Since it is conditioned and
limited by the six sense-bases, with their cessation it has to cease. Likewise,
to attend to the specific contact as the cause of feeling is the way of
disenchantment with both feeling and contact.</p>
<p>Finally, when one understands that this existence is dependent on grasping,
arising out of craving, one will not take existence seriously. Dependent on
existence is birth, <em>bhavapaccayā jāti</em>. While the magic show was going on, the
spectators found themselves in a magic world, because they grasped the magic in
it. Even so, existence, <em>bhava</em>, is dependent on grasping, <em>upādāna</em>.</p>
<p>Just as one seated on this side of a parapet wall might not see what is on the
other side, what we take as our existence in this world is bounded by our
parents from the point of view of birth. What we take as death is the end of
this physical body. We are ignorant of the fact that it is a flux of
preparations, <em>saṅkhārasantati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn858-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn858">21</a></sup> Existence is therefore something
prepared or made up. Birth is dependent on existence.</p>
<p>Sometimes we happen to buy from a shop an extremely rickety machine deceived by
its paint and polish, and take it home as a brand new thing. The very next day
it goes out of order. The newly bought item was born only the previous day, and
now it is out of order, to our disappointment.</p>
<p>So is our birth with its unpredictable vicissitudes, taking us through decay,
disease, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. This is the price we pay
for this brand new body we are blessed with in this existence.</p>
<p>In this way we can examine the relation between any two links of the formula of
dependent arising. It is the insight into this norm that constitutes the
understanding of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, and not the parrot-like recitation by
heart of the formula in direct and reverse order.</p>
<p>Of course, the formulation in direct and reverse order has its own special
significance, which highlights the fact that the possibility of a cessation of
those twelve links lies in their arising nature itself. Whatever is of a nature
to arise, all that is of a nature to cease, <em>yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabbaṁ
taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>. As for the <em>arahant</em>, he has realized this fact in a way
that the influxes are made extinct.</p>
<p>To go further into the significance of the formula, we may examine why
ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, takes precedence in it. This is not because it is permanent
or uncaused. The deepest point in the problem of release from <em>saṁsāra</em> is
traceable to the term <em>āsavā</em>, or influxes. Influxes are sometimes reckoned as
fourfold, namely those of sensuality, <em>kāmāsavā</em>, of existence, <em>bhavāsavā</em>, of
views, <em>diṭṭhāsavā</em>, and of ignorance, <em>avijjāsavā</em>.</p>
<p>But more often, in contexts announcing the attainment of <em>arahanthood</em>, the
standard reference is to three types of influxes, <em>kāmāsavā pi cittaṁ vimuccati,
bhavāsavā pi cittaṁ vimuccati, āvijjāsavā pi cittaṁ vimuccati,</em> the mind is
released from influxes of sensuality, existence and ignorance. This is because
the influxes of ignorance could easily include those of views as well.</p>
<p>The term <em>āsavā</em> implies those corrupting influences ingrained in beings due to
<em>saṁsāric</em> habits. They have a tendency to flow in and tempt beings towards
sensuality, existence and ignorance.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to understand why even ignorance is reckoned as a kind of
influxes, while it is recognized as the first link in the chain of dependent
arising. Ignorance or ignoring is itself a habit. There is a tendency in
<em>saṁsāric</em> beings to grope in darkness and dislike light. They have a tendency
to blink at the light and ignore. It is easy to ignore and forget. This
forgetting trait enables them to linger long in <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>Ignorance as a kind of influxes is so powerful that even the keenest in wisdom
cannot attain <em>arahanthood</em> at once. The wheel of Dhamma has to turn four times,
hence the fourfold distinction as stream-winner, once returner, non-returner and
<em>arahant</em>. The difficulty of combating this onslaught of influxes is already
insinuated by the term <em>sattakkhattuparama</em>, ‘seven more lives at the
most’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn859-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn859">22</a></sup> designating a stream-winner, and the term <em>sakadāgāmī</em>,
‘once-returner’.</p>
<p>The way to cut off these influxes is the very insight into the law of dependent
arising. Sometimes the path is defined as the law of dependent arising itself.
That doesn’t mean the ability to rattle off the twelve links by heart, but the
task of bringing the mind to rest on the norm of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa uppādā idaṁ upajjati,</em> <br />
<em>imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati.</em></p>
<p>This being, this comes to be; <br />
With the arising of this, this arises; <br />
This not being, this does not come to be; <br />
With the cessation of this, this ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is an extremely difficult task, because the mind tends to slip off. The
habitual tendency is to grasp this one or the other. The worldling, for the most
part, rests on a duality. Not to cling even to the middle is the ideal of an
<em>arahant</em>. That is the implication of the conclusive statement in the advice to
Bāhiya, <em>nev’idha na huraṁ na ubhayam antarena</em>, “neither here, nor there, no in
between the two”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn860-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn860">23</a></sup></p>
<p>For clarity’s sake, let us quote the relevant section in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha. Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na
tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev’idha na huraṁ na ubhayamantarena. Es’ ev’ anto
dukkhassa</em>.</p>
<p>And when, Bāhiya, you are not by it, then, Bāhiya, you are not in it. And
when, Bāhiya, you are not in it, then, Bāhiya, you are neither here nor there
nor in between. This, itself, is the end of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one who has fully understood the norm of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is not attached
to ignorance, nor is he attached to preparations, since he has seen the
relatedness between them. He is attached neither to preparations nor to
consciousness, having seen the relatedness between them. The insight into this
dependent arising and ceasing promotes such a detached attitude.</p>
<p>It is this insight that inculcated in the Tathāgata that supreme and excellent
suchness. His neutral attitude was not the result of any lack of knowledge, or
tactical eel wriggling, as in the case of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta.</p>
<p>Why does the Tathāgata not declare the sense-data categorically as true or
false? He knows that, given ignorance, they are true, and that they are
falsified only when ignorance fades away in one who sees the cessation. It is
for such a person that the sense-bases appear as false and consciousness appears
as a conjurer’s trick.</p>
<p>Fortified with that understanding, he does not categorically assert the
sense-data as true, nor does he reprimand those who assert them as the truth.
That is why the Buddha advocates a tolerant attitude in this discourse. This is
the typical attitude of an understanding elder to the questions put by an
inquisitive toddler.</p>
<p>Generally, the dogmatists in the world are severally entrenched in their own
individual viewpoints, as the line <em>paccekasaccesu puthū niviṭṭhā</em>
suggests.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn861-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn861">24</a></sup> We explained the term <em>sayasaṁvuta</em> as on a par with the
phrase <em>paccekasaccesu</em>. The problematic term <em>sayasaṁvuta</em> is suggestive of
virulent self-opinionatedness. Why are they committed and limited by their own
views? Our quotation from the <em>Cūḷaviyūhasutta</em> holds the answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na h’eva saccāni bahūni nānā,</em> <br />
<em>aññatra saññāya niccāni loke,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn862-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn862">25</a></sup></p>
<p>There are no several and various truths, <br />
That are permanent in the world, apart from perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to one’s level of perception, one forms a notion of reality. To those
in the audience the tricks of the magician remained concealed. It is that
ignorance which aroused preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, in them.</p>
<p>A typical illustration of individual truths, <em>paccekasacca</em>, is found in the
chapter titled <em>Jaccandha</em>, ‘congenitally blind’, in the <em>Udāna</em>. There the
Buddha brings up a parable of the blind men and the elephant.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn863-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn863">26</a></sup></p>
<p>A certain king got a crowd of congenitally blind men assembled, and having made
them touch various limbs of an elephant, asked them what an elephant looks like.
Those who touched the elephant’s head compared the elephant to a pot, those who
touched its ears compared it to a winnowing basket, those who touched its tusk
compared it to a ploughshare and so forth.</p>
<p>The dogmatic views in the world follow the same trend. All that is due to
contact, <em>phassapaccayā</em>, says the Buddha in the <em>Brahmajālasutta</em> even with
reference to those who have supernormal knowledges, <em>abhiññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn864-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn864">27</a></sup> Depending
on name-and-form, which they grasped, they evolved dogmatic theories, based on
their perceptions, spurred on by sense-contact. Their dogmatic involvement is
revealed by the thematic assertion <em>idam eva saccaṁ, mogham aññaṁ</em>, “this alone
is true, all else is false”.</p>
<p>The Buddha had no dogmatic involvement, because he had seen the cessation of
consciousness. Even the mind ceases, and mind-objects fade away. That is why the
Buddha was tolerantly neutral. On many such issues, silence happens to be the
answer.</p>
<p>This brings us to an extremely deep dimension of this Dhamma. Just as that man
with discerning wisdom at the magic show had difficulties in coming to terms
with the naive magic fan, so the Buddha, too, had to face situations where
problems of communication cropped up.</p>
<p>We come across such an instance in the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em>. On his way to
Kusinārā, to attain <em>parinibbāna</em>, the Buddha happened to rest under a tree for
a while, to overcome fatigue. Pukkusa of Malla, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma, who
was coming from Kusinārā on his way to Pāvā, saw the Buddha seated there and
approached him. After worshipping him he made the following joyful utterance:
<em>Santena vata, bhante, pabbajitā vihārena viharanti</em>, “Venerable Sir, those who
have gone forth are indeed living a peaceful life”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn865-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn865">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Though it was apparently a compliment for the Buddha, he came out with an
episode, which was rather in praise of his teacher Āḷāra Kālāma, who had
attained to the plane of nothingness, <em>ākiñcaññāyatana</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While on a long journey, my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma sat under a wayside tree for
noonday siesta. Just then five-hundred carts were passing by. After the carts
had passed that spot, the man who was following them walked up to Āḷāra Kālāma
and asked him:</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, did you see about five-hundred carts passing by?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I didn’t see.”</p>
<p>“But, Venerable sir, didn’t you even hear the sound?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I didn’t hear the sound.”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, were you asleep, then?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I was not asleep.”</p>
<p>“Were you conscious, then, Venerable sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend.”</p>
<p>“So, then, venerable sir, while being conscious and awake, you neither saw nor
heard as many as five-hundred carts passing by. All the same your double robe
is bespattered with mud.”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, Venerable Sir, that man was highly impressed by it, and paid the
following compliment to Āḷāra Kālāma:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is a wonder, it is a marvel, what a peaceful life those who have gone
forth are leading, so much so that one being conscious and awake would neither
see nor hear as many as five-hundred carts passing by.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Pukkusa cited this incident in praise of Āḷāra Kālāma, the Buddha asked
him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you think, Pukkusa, which of these two feats is more difficult to
accomplish, that one being conscious and awake would neither see nor hear as
many as five-hundred carts passing by, or that while being conscious and
awake, one would not see or hear the streaks of lightening and peals of
thunder in the midst of a torrential downpour?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Pukkusa grants that the latter feat is by far the more difficult to
accomplish, the Buddha comes out with one of his past experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At one time, Pukkusa, I was staying in a chaff house at Ātumā, and there was
a torrential downpour, with streaks of lightening and peals of thunder, during
the course of which two farmers – brothers – and four bulls were struck down
dead. A big crowd of people had gathered at the spot. Coming out of the chaff
house, I was pacing up and down in open air when a man from that crowd walked
up to me and worshipped me, and respectfully stood on one side. Then I asked
him:</p>
<p>“Friend, why has this big crowd gathered here?”</p>
<p>“Just now, Venerable Sir, while it was raining in torrents with streaks of
lightening and peals of thunder, two farmers – brothers – and four bulls were
struck down dead. That is why a big crowd has gathered here. But where were
you, Venerable Sir?”</p>
<p>“I was here itself, friend.”</p>
<p>“But didn’t you see it, Venerable Sir?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I didn’t see it.”</p>
<p>“But didn’t you hear the sound, Venerable Sir?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I did not hear the sound.”</p>
<p>“But, then, Venerable Sir, were you asleep?”</p>
<p>“No, friend, I was not asleep.”</p>
<p>“But, Venerable Sir, were you conscious (<em>saññī</em>)?”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, Pukkusa, that man expressed his surprise in the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is a wonder, it is a marvel, what a peaceful life those who have gone
forth are leading, so much so that while being conscious and awake one would
neither see nor hear the streaks of lightening and peals of thunder in the
midst of a torrential downpour.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“With that he came out with his fervent faith in me, worshipped me,
reverentially circumambulated me and left.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some interpret this incident as an illustration of the Buddha’s attainment to
the cessation of perceptions and feelings. But if it had been the case, the
words <em>saññī samāno jāgaro</em>, “while being conscious and awake”, would be out of
place.</p>
<p>That man expressed his wonder at the fact that the Buddha, while being conscious
and awake, had not seen or heard anything, though it was raining in torrents
with streaks of lightening and peals of thunder. Nor can this incident be
interpreted as a reference to the realm of nothingness, <em>ākiñcaññāyatana</em>, in
the context of the allusion to Āḷārā Kālāma and his less impressive psychic
powers.</p>
<p>The true import of this extraordinary psychic feat has to be assessed with
reference to the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, we have already discussed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn866-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn866">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The incident had occurred while the Buddha was seated in <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>,
experiencing the cessation of the six sense-spheres, equivalent to the cessation
of the world. He had gone beyond the world – that is why he didn’t see or hear.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to appreciate meaningfully that much-vexed riddle-like
verse we had quoted earlier from the <em>Kalahavivādasutta.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na saññasaññī, na visaññasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>no pi asaññī na vibhūtasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn867-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn867">30</a></sup></p>
<p>He is not conscious of normal perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor is he unconscious, <br />
He is not devoid of perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor has he rescinded perception, <br />
It is to one thus constituted <br />
<span class="vin"></span> that form ceases to exist, <br />
For reckonings through prolificity <br />
<span class="vin"></span> have perception as their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perception is the source of all prolific reckonings, such as those that impelled
the audience at the magic show to respond with the ‘Ahs’, and ‘Ohs’ and
whistles. One is completely free from that prolific perception when one is in
the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, experiencing the cessation of the six sense-spheres.</p>
<p>As we had earlier cited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… one is neither percipient of earth in earth, nor of water in water, nor of
fire in fire, nor of air in air, nor is one conscious of a ‘this world’ in
this world, nor of ‘another world’ in another world …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on, but all the same ‘one is percipient’, <em>saññī ca pana assa.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn868-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn868">31</a></sup>
Of what is he percipient or conscious? That is none other than what comes up as
the title of these series of sermons, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn869-1"><a href="sermon-26.html#fn-fn869">32</a></sup></p>
<p>This is peaceful, this is excellent, namely the stilling of all preparations,
the relinquishment of all assets, the destruction of craving, detachment,
cessation, extinction.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-seventh sermon in the series
of sermons on Nibbāna. In our last sermon, we brought up some similes and
illustrations to explain why the suchness of the Tathāgata has been given
special emphasis in the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the Buddha’s sermon, comparing consciousness to a magic
show, we made an attempt to discover the secrets of a modern day magic show from
a hidden corner of the stage. The parable of the magic show revealed us the fact
that the direct and the indirect formulation of the Law of Dependent Arising,
known as <em>tathatā</em>, suchness, or <em>idapaccayatā</em>, specific conditionality, is
similar to witnessing a magic show from two different points of view. That is to
say, the deluded point of view of the spectator in the audience and the
discerning point of view of the wisdom-eyed critic, hidden in a corner of the
stage.</p>
<p>The reason for the riddle-like outward appearance of the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> is
the problem of resolving the conflict between these two points of view. However,
the fact that the Tathāgata resolved this conflict at a supramundane level and
enjoyed the bliss of emancipation comes to light in the first three discourses
of the <em>Bodhivagga</em> in the <em>Udāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn871-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn871">2</a></sup></p>
<p>These three discourses tell us that, after the attainment of enlightenment, the
Buddha spent the first week in the same seated posture under the Bodhi tree, and
that on the last night of the week he reflected on the Law of Dependent Arising
in the direct order in the first watch of the night, in the reverse order in the
second watch, and both in direct and reverse order in the last watch.</p>
<p>These last-mentioned reflection, both in direct and reverse order, is like a
compromise between the deluded point of view and the discerning point of view,
mentioned above. Now, in a magic show to see <strong>how</strong> the magic is performed, is
to get disenchanted with it, to make it fade away and cease, to free the mind
from its spell. By seeing <strong>how</strong> a magician performs, one gets disgusted with
<strong>what</strong> he performs. Similarly, seeing the arising of the six bases of
sense-contact is the way to get disenchanted with them, to make them fade away
and cease, to transcend them and be emancipated.</p>
<p>We come across two highly significant verses in the <em>Soṇasutta</em> among the Sixes
of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> with reference to the emancipation of the mind of an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nekkhammaṁ adhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>pavivekañca cetaso,</em> <br />
<em>abhyāpajjhādhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>upādānakkhayassa ca,</em></p>
<p><em>taṇhakkhayādhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>asammohañca cetaso,</em> <br />
<em>disvā āyatanuppādaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sammā cittaṁ vimuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn872-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn872">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The mind of one who is fully attuned <br />
To renunciation and mental solitude, <br />
Who is inclined towards harmlessness, <br />
Ending of grasping,</p>
<p>Extirpation of craving, <br />
And non-delusion of mind, <br />
On seeing the arising of sense-bases, <br />
Is fully emancipated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see how the sense-bases arise is to be released in mind. Accordingly we can
understand how the magic consciousness of one who is enjoying a magic show comes
to cease by comprehending it. Magic consciousness subsides. In other words, it
is transformed into a non-manifestative consciousness, which no longer displays
any magic.</p>
<p>That is the mental transformation that occurred in the man who watched the magic
show from a hidden corner of the stage. This gives us a clue to the cessation of
consciousness in the <em>arahant</em> and the consequent non-manifestative
consciousness attributed to him.</p>
<p>The <em>Dvāyatanānupassanasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> also bears testimony to this
fact. The title itself testifies to the question of duality forming the theme of
this discourse. Throughout the sutta we find a refrain-like distinction between
the arising and the ceasing of various phenomena. It is like an illustration of
the two aspects of the problem that confronted the Buddha. Now that we are
concerned with the question of the cessation of consciousness, let us quote the
relevant couplet of verses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci dukkhaṁ sambhoti,</em> <br />
<em>sabbaṁ viññāṇapaccayā,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇassa nirodhena</em> <br />
<em>natthi dukkhassa sambhavo.</em></p>
<p><em>Etam ādīnavaṁ ñatvā,</em> <br />
<em>‘dukkhaṁ viññāṇapaccayā’,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇūpasamā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nicchāto parinibbuto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn873-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn873">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever suffering that arises, <br />
All that is due to consciousness, <br />
With the cessation of consciousness, <br />
There is no arising of suffering.</p>
<p>Knowing this peril: <br />
‘This suffering dependent on consciousness’, <br />
By calming down consciousness, a monk <br />
Is hunger-less and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comparison between the magic show and consciousness becomes more meaningful
in the context of this discourse. As in the case of a magic show, the delusory
character of the magic of consciousness is traceable to the perception of form.
It is the perception of form which gives rise to the host of reckonings through
cravings, conceits and views, which bring about a delusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, a monk intent on attaining Nibbāna has to get rid of the magical
spell of the perception of form. The verse we cited from the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>
the other day has an allusion to this requirement. That verse, beginning with
the words <em>na saññasaññī,</em> is an attempt to answer the question raised in a
previous verse in that sutta, posing the query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn874-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn874">5</a></sup></p>
<p>to one, constituted in which manner, does form cease to exist?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us remind ourselves of that verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na saññasaññī, na visaññasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>no pi asaññī na vibhūtasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em></p>
<p>He is not conscious of normal perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor is he unconscious, <br />
He is not devoid of perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor has he rescinded perception, <br />
It is to one thus constituted <br />
<span class="vin"></span> that form ceases to exist, <br />
For reckonings through prolificity <br />
<span class="vin"></span> have perception as their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the last line states a crucial fact. Reckonings, designations and the like,
born of prolificity, are traceable to perception in the last analysis. That is
to say, all that is due to perception.</p>
<p>Another reason why form has received special attention here, is the fact that it
is a precondition for contact. When there is form, there is the notion of
resistance. That is already implicit in the question that comes in a verse at
the beginning of the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kismiṁ vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn875-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn875">6</a></sup></p>
<p>when what is not there, do touches not touch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that query is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>,</p>
<p>when form is not there, touches do not touch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a phrase relevant to this point in the <em>Saṅgītisutta</em> of the
<em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>, that is, <em>sanidassanasappaṭighaṁ rūpaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn876-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn876">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Materiality, according to this phrase, has two characteristics. It has the
quality of manifesting itself, <em>sanidassana</em>; it also offers resistance,
<em>sappaṭigha</em>. Both these aspects are hinted at in a verse from the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em>
we had quoted at the very beginning of this series of sermons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>etthasā chijjate jaṭā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn877-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn877">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Jaṭāsutta</em> tells us the place where the tangle within and the tangle
without, <em>antojaṭā bahijaṭā</em>, of this gigantic <em>saṁsāric</em> puzzle is solved. And
here is the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherein name and form <br />
As well as resistance and the perception of form <br />
Are completely cut off, <br />
It is there that the tangle gets snapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase <em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca</em> is particularly significant. Not only the
term <em>paṭigha</em>, implying ‘resistance’, but also the term <em>rūpasaññā</em> deserves
our attention, as it is suggestive of the connection between form and
perception. It is perception that brings an image of form. Perception is the
source of various reckonings and destinations.</p>
<p>The term <em>saññā</em> has connotations of a ‘mark’, a ‘sign’, or a ‘token’, as we
have already pointed out.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn878-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn878">9</a></sup> It is as if a party going through a forest is
blazing a trail for their return by marking notches on the trees with an axe.
The notion of permanence is therefore implicit in the term <em>saññā</em>.</p>
<p>So it is this <em>saññā</em> that gives rise to <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em>, reckonings through
prolificity. The compound term <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, occurring in the
<em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn879-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn879">10</a></sup> is suggestive of this connection between <em>saññā</em>
and <em>saṅkhā</em>.</p>
<p>Reckonings, definitions and designations, arising from prolific perception, are
collectively termed <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>. The significance attached to <em>saññā</em>
could easily be guessed by the following dictum in the <em>Guhaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāṁ pariññā vitareyya oghaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn880-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn880">11</a></sup></p>
<p>comprehend perception and cross the flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full comprehension of the nature of perception enables one to cross the four
great floods of defilements in <em>saṁsāra</em>. In other words, the penetrative
understanding of perception is the way to deliverance.</p>
<p>Let us now go a little deeper into the connotations of the term <em>saññā</em>. In the
sense of ‘sign’ or ‘token’, it has to have something to signify or symbolize.
Otherwise there is no possibility of designation. A sign can be significant only
if there is something to signify. This is a statement that might need a lot of
reflection before it is granted.</p>
<p>A sign properly so called is something that signifies, and when there is nothing
to signify, it ceases to be a sign. So also is the case with the symbol. This is
a norm which is well explained in the <em>Mahāvedallasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em>. In the course of a dialogue between Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita and
Venerable Sāriputta, we find in that sutta the following pronouncement made by
Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo kho, āvuso, kiñcano, doso kiñcano, moho kiñcano, te khīnāsavassa
bhikkhuno pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvakatā āyatiṁ
anuppādadhammā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn881-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn881">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Lust, friend, is something, hate is something, delusion is something. They
have been abandoned in an influx-free monk, uprooted, made like a palm tree
deprived of its site, made extinct and rendered incapable of sprouting again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So lust is a something, hate is a something, delusion is a something. Now a sign
is significant and a symbol is symbolic only when there is something. Another
statement that occurs a little later in that dialogue offers us a clarification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo kho, āvuso, nimittakaraṇo, doso nimittakaraṇo, moho nimittakaraṇo</em>,</p>
<p>lust, friend, is significative, hate is significative, delusion is
significative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can well infer that it is only so long as there are things like lust,
hate and delusion that signs are significant. In other words, why the Tathāgata
declared that there is no essence in the magic show of consciousness is because
there is nothing in him that signs or symbols can signify or symbolize.</p>
<p>What are these things? Lust, hate and delusion. That is why the term <em>akiñcana</em>,
literally ‘thing-less’, is an epithet for the <em>arahant</em>. He is thing-less not
because he no longer has the worldly possessions of a layman, but because the
afore-said things lust, hate and delusion are extinct in him. For the Tathāgata,
the magic show of consciousness has nothing substantial in it, because there was
nothing in him to make the signs significant.</p>
<p>That man with discernment, who watched the magic show from a hidden corner of
the stage, found it to be hollow and meaningless, since he had, in a limited and
relative sense, got rid of attachment, aversion and delusion. That is to say,
after discovering the tricks of the magician, he lost the earlier impulses to
laugh, cry and fear. Now he has no curiosity, since the delusion is no more. At
least temporarily, ignorance has gone down in the light of understanding.
According to this norm, we can infer that signs become significant due to greed,
hate and delusion in our own minds. Perceptions pander to these emotive
tendencies.</p>
<p>The concluding verse of the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> is
particularly important, in that it sums up the <em>arahant’s</em> detachment regarding
perceptions and his release through wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāvirattassa na santi ganthā,</em> <br />
<em>paññāvimuttassa na santi mohā,</em> <br />
<em>saññañca diṭṭhiñca ye aggahesuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te ghaṭṭayantā vicaranti loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn882-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn882">13</a></sup></p>
<p>To one detached from percepts there are no bonds, <br />
To one released through wisdom there are no delusions, <br />
Those who hold on to percepts and views, <br />
Go about wrangling in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this state of detachment from perceptions and release through wisdom that
is summed up by the phrase <em>anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ</em> in some
discourses. With reference to the <em>arahant</em> it is said that he has realized by
himself through higher knowledge in this very life that influx-free deliverance
of the mind and deliverance through wisdom, <em>anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ
diṭṭhevadhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn883-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn883">14</a></sup></p>
<p>So we could well infer that the <em>arahant</em> is free from the enticing bonds of
perceptions and the deceptive tricks of consciousness. It is this unshakeable
stability that finds expression in the epithets <em>anejo</em>, ‘immovable’, and
<em>ṭhito</em>, ‘stable’, used with reference to the <em>arahant</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn884-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn884">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Āneñjasappāyasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> opens with the following
exhortation by the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccā, bhikkhave, kāmā tucchā musā mosadhammā, māyākatam etaṁ, bhikkhave,
bālalāpanaṁ. Ye ca diṭṭhadhammikā kāmā, ye ca samparāyikā kāmā, yā ca
diṭṭhadhammikā kāmasaññā, yā ca samparāyikā kāmasañña, ubhayam etaṁ
Māradheyyaṁ, Mārass’esa visayo, Mārass’ esa nivāpo, Mārass’ esa
gocaro.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn885-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn885">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Impermanent, monks, are sense pleasures, they are empty, false and deceptive
by nature, they are conjuror’s tricks, monks, tricks that make fools prattle.
Whatever pleasures there are in this world, whatever pleasures that are in the
other world, whatever pleasurable percepts there are in this world, whatever
pleasurable percepts that are in the other world, they all are within the
realm of Māra, they are the domain of Māra, the bait of Māra, the beat of
Māra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This exhortation accords well with what was said above regarding the magic show.
It clearly gives the impression that there is the possibility of attaining a
state of mind in which those signs are no longer significant.</p>
<p>The comparison of consciousness to a magic show has deeper implications. The
insinuation is that one has to comprehend perception for what it is, in order to
become dispassionate towards it, <em>saññaṁ pariññā vitareyya oghaṁ</em>, “comprehend
perception and cross the flood”. When perception is understood inside out,
disenchantment sets in as a matter of course, since delusion is no more.</p>
<p>Three kinds of deliverances are mentioned in connection with the <em>arahants</em>,
namely <em>animitta</em>, the signless, <em>appaṇihita</em>, the undirected, and <em>suññata</em>,
the void.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn886-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn886">17</a></sup> We spoke of signs being significant. Now where there is no
signification, when one does not give any significance to signs, one does not
direct one’s mind to anything. <em>Paṇidhi</em> means ‘direction of the mind’, an
‘aspiration’. In the absence of any aspiration, there is nothing ‘essence-tial’
in existence.</p>
<p>There is a certain interconnection between the three deliverances. <em>Animitta</em>,
the signless, is that stage in which the mind refuses to take a sign or catch a
theme in anything. Where lust, hate and delusion are not there to give any
significance, signs become ineffective. That is the signless. Where there is no
tendency to take in signs, there is no aspiration, expectation or direction of
the mind.</p>
<p>It is as if dejection in regard to the magic show has given rise to
disenchantment and dispassion. When the mind is not directed to the magic show,
it ceases to exist. It is only when the mind is continually there, directed
towards the magic show or a film show, that they exist for a spectator. One
finds oneself born into a world of magic only when one sees something
substantial in it. A magic world is made up only when there is an incentive to
exist in it.</p>
<p>Deeper reflection on this simile of the magic show would fully expose the
interior of the magical illusion of consciousness. Where there is no grasping at
signs, there is no direction or expectation, in the absence of which, existence
ceases to appear substantial. That is why the three terms singless, <em>animitta</em>,
undirected, <em>appaṇihita</em> and void <em>suññata</em>, are used with reference to an
<em>arahant</em>. These three terms come up in a different guise in a discourse on
Nibbāna we had discussed earlier. There they occur as <em>appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ</em>
and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn887-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn887">18</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Appatiṭṭhaṁ</em> means ‘unestablished’. Mind gets established when there is desire
or aspiration, <em>paṇidhi</em>. Contemplation on the suffering aspect,
<em>dukkhānupassanā</em>, eliminates desire. So the mind is unestablished.
Contemplation on not-self, <em>anattānupassanā</em>, does away with the notion of
substantiality, seeing nothing pithy or ‘essence-tial’ in existence.</p>
<p>Pith is something that endures. A tree that has pith has something durable,
though its leaves may drop off. Such notions of durability lose their hold on
the <em>arahant’s</em> mind. The contemplation of impermanence, <em>aniccānupassanā</em>,
ushers in the signless, <em>animitta</em>, state of the mind that takes no object,
<em>anārammaṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>The simile of the magic show throws light on all these aspects of deliverance.
Owing to this detachment from perception, <em>saññāviratta</em>, and release through
wisdom, <em>paññāvimutta</em>, an <em>arahant’s</em> point of view is totally different from
the wordling’s point of view. What appears as real for the worldling, is unreal
in the estimation of the <em>arahant</em>. There is such a wide gap between the two
viewpoints. This fact comes to light in the two kinds of reflections mentioned
in the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya ’idaṁ saccan’ti upanijjhāyitaṁ,
tadam ariyānaṁ ’etaṁ musā’ti yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya suddiṭṭhaṁ – ayaṁ
ekānupassanā. Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa

dutiyānupassanā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn888-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn888">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses, Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is pondered
over as ‘truth’, that by the <em>ariyans</em> has been well discerned with right
wisdom, as it is, as ‘untruth’. This is one mode of reflection. Monks,
whatsoever in the world with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the progeny
consisting of recluses, Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is pondered over as
‘untruth’, that by the <em>ariyans</em> has been well discerned with right wisdom, as
it is, as ‘truth’. This is the second mode of reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, one can well imagine what a great difference, what a contrast exists
between the two stand-points. The same idea is expressed in the verses that
follow, some of which we had cited earlier too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anattani attamāniṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passa lokaṁ sadevakaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>niviṭṭhaṁ nāmarūpasmiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>idaṁ saccan’ti maññati.</em></p>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti,</em> <br />
<em>tato taṁ hoti aññathā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ hi tassa musā hoti,</em> <br />
<em>mosadhammaṁ hi ittaraṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Amosadhammaṁ nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā saccato vidū,</em> <br />
<em>te ve saccābhisamayā,</em> <br />
<em>nicchātā parinibbutā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn889-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn889">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Just see the world, with all its gods, <br />
Fancying a self where none exists, <br />
Entrenched in name-and-form it holds <br />
The conceit that this is real.</p>
<p>In whatever way they imagine, <br />
Thereby it turns otherwise, <br />
That itself is the falsity, <br />
Of this puerile deceptive thing.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is unfalsifying in its nature, <br />
That they understood as the truth, <br />
And, indeed, by the higher understanding of that truth, <br />
They have become hunger-less and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us go for a homely illustration to familiarize ourselves with the facts we
have related so far. Two friends are seen drawing something together on a board
with two kinds of paints. Let us have a closer look. They are painting a chess
board. Now the board is chequered. Some throw-away chunks of wood are also
painted for the pieces. So the board and pieces are ready.</p>
<p>Though they are the best of friends and amicably painted the chessboard, the
game of chess demands two sides – the principle of duality. They give in to the
demand and confront each other in a playful mood. A hazy idea of victory and
defeat, another duality, hovers above them. But they are playing the game just
for fun, to while away the time. Though it is for fun, there is a competition.
Though there is a competition, it is fun.</p>
<p>While the chess-game is in progress, a happy-go-lucky benefactor comes by and
offers a handsome prize for the prospective winner, to enliven the game. From
now onwards, it is not just for fun or to while away the time that the two
friends are playing chess. Now that the prospect of a prize has aroused greed in
them, the innocuous game becomes a tussle for a prize.</p>
<p>Worthless pieces dazzle with the prospect of a prize. But just then, there comes
a pervert killjoy, who shows a threatening weapon and adds a new rule to the
game. The winner will get the prize all right, but the loser he will kill with
his deadly weapon.</p>
<p>So what is the position now? The sportive spirit is gone. It is now a struggle
for dear life. The two friends are now eying each other as an enemy. It is no
longer a game, but a miserable struggle to escape death.</p>
<p>We do not know, how exactly the game ended. But let us hold the post mortem all
the same. We saw how those worthless chunks of wood picked up to serve as pieces
on the chessboard, received special recognition once they took on the paint.
They represented two sides.</p>
<p>With the prospect of a prize, they got animated in the course of the game, due
to cravings, conceits and views in the minds of the two players. Those impulses
were so overwhelming that especially after the death knell sounded, the whole
chess board became the world for these two friends. Their entire attention was
on the board – a life and death struggle.</p>
<p>But this is only one aspect of our illustration. The world, in fact, is a
chessboard, where an unending chess game goes on. Let us look at the other
aspect. Now, for the <em>arahant</em>, the whole world appears like a chessboard. That
is why the <em>arahant</em> Adhimutta, when the bandits caught him while passing
through a forest and got ready to kill him, uttered the following instructive
verse, which we had quoted earlier too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yadā paññāya passati,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn890-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn890">21</a></sup></p>
<p>When one sees with wisdom, <br />
This world as comparable to grass and twigs, <br />
Not finding anything worthwhile holding onto as mine, <br />
One does not grieve, saying: ‘O! I have nothing!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Adhimutta’s fearless challenge to the bandit chief was extraordinary
– you may kill me if you like, but the position is this: When one sees with
wisdom the entire world, the world of the five aggregates, as comparable to
grass and twigs, one does not experience any egoism and therefore does not
grieve the loss of one’s life.</p>
<p>Some verses uttered by the Buddha deepen our understanding of the <em>arahant’s</em>
standpoint. The following verse of the <em>Dhammapada</em>, for instance, highlights
the conflict between victory and defeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jayaṁ veraṁ passavati,</em> <br />
<em>dukkhaṁ seti parājito,</em> <br />
<em>upasanto sukhaṁ seti</em> <br />
<em>hitvā jayaparājayaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn891-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn891">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Victory breeds hatred, <br />
In sorrow lies the defeated, <br />
The one serene is ever at peace, <br />
Giving up victory and defeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the chess game, the idea of winning gives rise to hatred. The loser in the
game has sorrow as his lot. But the <em>arahant</em> is at peace, having given up
victory and defeat. Isn’t it enough for him to give up victory? Why is it said
that he gives up both victory and defeat?</p>
<p>These two go as a pair. This recognition of a duality is a distinctive feature
of this Dhamma. It gives, in a nutshell, the essence of this Dhamma. The idea of
a duality is traceable to the vortex between consciousness and name-and-form.
The same idea comes up in the following verse of the <em>Attadaṇḍasutta</em> in the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa natthi ’idaṁ me’ti</em> <br />
<em>‘paresaṁ’ vā pi kiñcanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn892-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn892">23</a></sup></p>
<p>He who has nothing to call ‘this is mine’, <br />
Not even something to recognize as ‘theirs’, <br />
Finding no egoism within himself, <br />
He grieves not, crying: ‘O! I have nothing!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far in this series of sermons on Nibbāna, we were trying to explain what sort
of a state Nibbāna is. We had to do so, because there has been quite a lot of
confusion and controversy regarding Nibbāna as the aim of the spiritual
endeavour in Buddhism. The situation today is no better. Many of those who
aspire to Nibbāna today, aim not at the cessation of existence, but at some form
of quasi existence as a surrogate Nibbāna.</p>
<p>If the aiming is wrong, will the arrow reach the target? Our attempt so far has
been to clarify and highlight this target, which we call Nibbāna. If we have
been successful in this attempt, the task before us now is to adumbrate the
salient features of the path of practice.</p>
<p>Up to now, we have been administering a purgative, to dispel some deep-rooted
wrong notions. If it has worked, it is time now for the elixir. In the
fore-going sermons, we had occasion to bring up a number of key terms in the
suttas, which have been more or less relegated into the limbo and rarely come up
in serious Dhamma discussions.</p>
<p>We have highlighted such key terms as <em>suññatā, dvayatā, tathatā, atammayatā,
idappaccayatā, papañca,</em> and <em>maññanā</em>. We have also discussed some aspects of
their significance. But in doing so, our main concern was the dispelling of some
misconceptions about Nibbāna as the goal.</p>
<p>The aim of this series of sermons, however, is not the satisfying of some
curiosity at an academic level. It is to pave the way for an attainment of this
goal, by rediscovering the intrinsic qualities of this Dhamma that is well
proclaimed, <em>svākkhāto</em>, visible here and now, <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em>, timeless,
<em>akāliko</em>, inviting one to come and see, <em>ehipassiko</em>, leading one onwards,
<em>opanayiko</em>, and realizable personally by the wise, <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo
viññūhi.</em> So the few sermons that will follow, might well be an elixir to the
minds of those meditators striving hard day and night to realize Nibbāna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lobho, doso ca moho ca,</em> <br />
<em>purisaṁ pāpacetasaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>hiṁsanti attasambhūtā,</em> <br />
<em>tacasāraṁ va samphalaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn893-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn893">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Greed and hate and delusion too, <br />
Sprung from within work harm on him <br />
Of evil wit, as does its fruit <br />
On the reed for which the bark is pith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main idea behind this verse is that the three defilements – greed, hatred
and delusion – spring up from within, that they are <em>attasambhūta</em>,
self-begotten. What is the provocation for such a statement?</p>
<p>It is generally believed that greed, hatred and delusion originate from external
signs. The magic show and the chess game have shown us how signs become
significant. They become significant because they find something within that
they can signify and symbolize.</p>
<p>Now this is where the question of radical reflection, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, comes
in. What the Buddha brings up in this particular context, is the relevance of
that radical reflection as a pre-requisite for treading the path.</p>
<p>The worldling thinks that greed, hatred and delusion arise due to external
signs. The Buddha points out that they arise from within an individual and
destroy him as in the case of the fruit of a reed or bamboo. It is this same
question of radical reflection that came up earlier in the course of our
discussion of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>, based on the following deep and winding
statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati
phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, yaṁ vedeti taṁ sañjānāti, yaṁ sañjānāti taṁ
vitakketi, yaṁ vitakketi taṁ papañceti, yaṁ papañceti tatonidānaṁ purisaṁ
papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti atītānāgatapaccuppannesu cakkhuviññeyyesu
rūpesu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn894-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn894">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Dependent on eye and forms, friend, arises eye-consciousness; the concurrence
of the three is contact; because of contact, feeling; what one feels, one
perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one reasons about, one
proliferates; what one proliferates, owing to that, reckonings born of
prolific perceptions overwhelm him in regard to forms cognizable by the eye
relating to the past, the future and the present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eye-consciousness, for instance, arises depending on eye and forms. The
concurrence of these three is called contact. Depending on this contact arises
feeling. What one feels, one perceives, and what one perceives, one reasons
about. The reasoning about leads to a proliferation that brings about an
obsession, as a result of which the reckonings born of prolific perceptions
overwhelm the individual concerned.</p>
<p>The process is somewhat similar to the destruction of the reed by its own fruit.
It shows how non-radical reflection comes about. Radical reflection is
undermined when proliferation takes over. The true source, the matrix, is
ignored, with the result an obsession follows, tantamount to an entanglement
within and without, <em>anto jaṭā bahi jaṭā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn895-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn895">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The paramount importance of radical reflection is revealed by the
<em>Sūcilomasutta</em> found in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, as well as in the <em>Sagāthakavagga</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. The <em>yakkha</em> Sūciloma poses some questions to the
Buddha in the following verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo ca doso ca kutonidānā,</em> <br />
<em>aratī ratī lomahaṁso kutojā,</em> <br />
<em>kuto samuṭṭhāya manovitakkā,</em> <br />

<p>Lust and hate, whence caused are they, <br />
Whence spring dislike, delight and terror, <br />
Whence arising do thoughts disperse, <br />
Like children leaving their mother’s lap?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha answers those questions in three verses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo ca doso ca itonidānā,</em> <br />
<em>aratī ratī lomahaṁso itojā,</em> <br />
<em>ito samuṭṭhāya manovitakkā,</em> <br />
<em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti.</em></p>
<p><em>Snehajā attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>nigrodhasseva khandhajā,</em> <br />
<em>puthū visattā kāmesu</em> <br />
<em>māluvā va vitatā vane.</em></p>
<p><em>Ye naṁ pajānanti yatonidānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te naṁ vinodenti, suṇohi yakkha,</em> <br />
<em>te duttaram ogham imaṁ taranti,</em> <br />
<em>atiṇṇapubbaṁ apunabbhavāya.</em></p>
<p>It is hence that lust and hate are caused, <br />
Hence spring dislike, delight and terror, <br />
Arising hence do thoughts disperse, <br />
Like children leaving their mother’s lap.</p>
<p>Moisture-born and self-begotten, <br />
Like the banyan’s trunk-born runners <br />
They cleave to diverse objects of sense, <br />
Like the <em>māluvā</em> creeper entwining the forest.</p>
<p>And they that know wherefrom it springs, <br />
They dispel it, listen, O! Yakkha. <br />
They cross this flood so hard to cross, <br />
Never crossed before, to become no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In explaining these verses, we are forced to depart from the commentarial trend.
The point of controversy is the phrase <em>kumārakā dhaṅkam iv’ ossajanti</em>,
recognized by the commentary as the last line of Sūciloma’s verse.</p>
<p>We adopted the variant reading <em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em>, found in some
editions. Let us first try to understand how the commentary interprets this
verse.</p>
<p>Its interpretation centres around the word <em>dhaṅka</em>, which means a crow. In
order to explain how thoughts disperse, it alludes to a game among village lads,
in which they tie the leg of a crow with a long string and let it fly away so
that it is forced to come back and fall at their feet.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn897-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn897">28</a></sup> The commentary
rather arbitrarily breaks up the compound term <em>manovitakkā</em> in trying to
explain that evil thoughts, <em>vitakkā</em>, distract the mind, <em>mano</em>.</p>
<p>If the variant reading <em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em> is adopted, the element
<em>v</em> in <em>vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em> could be taken as a hiatus filler, <em>āgama</em>, and
then we have the meaningful phrase <em>kumārakā aṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em>, “even as
children leave the lap”.</p>
<p>Lust and hate, delight and terror, spring from within. Even so are thoughts in
the mind, <em>manovitakkā</em>. We take it as one word, whereas the commentary breaks
it up into two words.</p>
<p>It is queer to find the same commentator analyzing this compound differently in
another context. In explaining the term <em>manovitakkā</em> occurring in the
<em>Kummasutta</em> of the <em>Devatā Saṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, the commentary
says <em>’manovitakke’ti manamhi uppannavitakke</em>: “<em>manovitakka</em>, this means
thoughts arisen in the mind”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn898-1"><a href="sermon-27.html#fn-fn898">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentator was forced to contradict himself in the present context, because
he wanted to justify the awkward simile of the game he himself had introduced.
The simile of leaving the mother’s lap, on the other hand, would make more
sense, particularly in the light of the second verse uttered by the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Snehajā attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>nigrodhasseva khandhajā,</em> <br />
<em>puthū visattā kāmesu</em> <br />
<em>māluvā va vitatā vane.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse enshrines a deep idea. <em>Sneha</em> is a word which has such meanings as
‘moisture’ and ‘affection’. In the simile of the banyan tree, the trunk-born
runners are born of moisture. They are self-begotten.</p>
<p>Thoughts in the mind cleave to diverse external objects. Just as the runners of
a banyan tree, once they take root would even conceal the main trunk, which gave
them birth, so the thoughts in the mind, attached to external objects of sense,
would conceal their true source and origin.</p>
<p>Non-radical reflection could easily come in. The runners are moisture-born and
self-begotten from the point of view of the original banyan tree. The main trunk
gets overshadowed by its own runners.</p>
<p>The next simile has similar connotations. The <em>māluvā</em> creeper is a plant
parasite. When some bird drops a seed of a <em>māluvā</em> creeper into a fork of a
tree, after some time a creeper comes up. As time goes on, it overspreads the
tree, which gave it nourishment.</p>
<p>Both similes illustrate the nature of non radical reflection. Conceptual
proliferation obscures the true source, namely the psychological mainsprings of
defilements. Our interpretation of children leaving the mother’s lap would be
meaningful in the context of the two terms <em>snehajā</em>, ‘born of affection’, and
<em>attasambhūtā</em>, ‘self-begotten’. There is possibly a pun on the word <em>sneha</em>.
Children are affection-born and self-begotten, from a mother’s point of view.</p>
<p>The basic theme running through these verses is the origin and source of things.
The commentator’s simile of the crow could ill afford to accommodate all the
nuances of these pregnant terms. It distracts one from the main theme of these
verses. The questions asked concern the origin, <em>kuto nidānā, kutojā, kuto
samuṭṭhāya</em>, and the answers are in full accord: <em>ito nidānā, itojā, ito
samuṭṭhāya</em>.</p>
<p>With reference to thoughts in the mind, the term <em>snehajā</em> could even mean ‘born
of craving’, and <em>attasambhūtā</em> conveys their origination from within. As in the
case of the runners of the banyan tree and the <em>māluvā</em> creeper, those defiling
thoughts, arisen from within, once they get attached to sense objects outside,
obscure their true source. The result is the pursuit of a mirage, spurred on by
non-radical reflection.</p>
<p>The last verse is of immense importance. It says: But those who know from where
all these mental states arise, are able to dispel them. It is they who
successfully cross this flood, so hard to cross, and are freed from re-becoming.</p>

<p>“This is peaceful, this is excellent, <br />
namely the stilling of all preparations, the relinquishment of all assets, <br />
the destruction of craving, detachment, cessation, extinction.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-eighth sermon in the series
of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Right view, the first factor of the noble eightfold path, is defined as the
knowledge of all the four noble truths, namely that of suffering, its arising,
its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. This is a pointer to the
fact that some understanding of cessation, or Nibbāna, is essential for the
practice of the path.</p>
<p>According to a discourse among the Twos of the <em>Aṅguttara-nikāya</em>, there are two
conditions for the arising of this right view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dve ’me, bhikkhave, paccayā sammādiṭṭhiyā uppādāya. Katame dve? Parato ca
ghoso yoniso ca manasikāro.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn900-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn900">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these two conditions for the arising of right view. Which
two? Hearing from another and radical reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, or ‘radical reflection’, is attention by
way of source or matrix. The deeper dimensions of its meaning would have come to
light in our discussion of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> with reference to a quotation
from the <em>Mahāpadānasutta</em>, in one of our earlier sermons. There we saw how the
bodhisatta Vipassī went on reflecting from the very end of the formula of
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, of dependent arising, in reverse order and gradually
arrived at the true source.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn901-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn901">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kimhi nu kho sati jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, kiṁ paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ? Jātiyā kho sati
jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>What being there, does decay and death come to be? Conditioned by what, is
decay-and-death? Birth being there does decay-and-death come to be,
conditioned by birth is decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, he directed his radical reflection gradually upwards, beginning
from decay-and-death, and at last came to the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex between
consciousness and name-and-form, which we discussed at length. This is an
illustration of the deepest sense of <em>yoniso manasikāra</em> as an attitude
essential for seeing the law of dependent arising within one’s own experience.</p>
<p>By now we have already laid bare some first principles for the arising of this
radical reflection in the form of similes like the magic show and the chess
game. Those similes have illustrated for us the first principle that a thing
originates from, and its ‘thingness’ depends on, the psychological responses and
mental traits of the person concerned.</p>
<p>The magic show and the chess game have exposed the fact that the signs and
symbols which we conceive to be out there owe their significance and symbolic
nature to the deep-rooted psychological mainsprings of lust, hate and delusion.</p>
<p>It was while discussing how the <em>Sūcilomasutta</em> presents the question of radical
reflection that we were forced to stop our last sermon. To the question of
Yakkha Sūciloma as to the source of lust, hate, delight and terror, the Buddha
replied that they arise ‘hence’, from ‘hence’ itself. In the Pāli verses the
Yakkha’s questions <em>kutonidānā, kutojā, kuto samuṭṭhāya</em> met with the replies
<em>itonidānā, itojā, ito samuṭṭhāya</em> from the Buddha’s side.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn902-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn902">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This <em>ito</em>, ‘hence’, means from within one’s self. This is clear from the term
<em>attasambhūta</em>, ‘self-begotten’, in the reply given by the Buddha. It is to
illustrate this self-begotten nature that the Buddha brings in the similes of
the banyan tree and the <em>māluvā</em> creeper. When the runners coming down from the
branches of a banyan tree reach the ground and get rooted, after a time, it will
be difficult to distinguish the original trunk of the tree from its offsprings.
So also is the case with the parasitic <em>māluvā</em> creeper. When the seed of a
<em>māluvā</em> creeper takes root in the fork of a tree and grows up, it not only
kills the tree, but also overspreads it in such a way as to obscure its origin.</p>
<p>From these similes we can infer that the self-begotten nature of those
psychological states are also generally overlooked or ignored. They are revealed
only to radical reflection, to attention by way of source or matrix. That is why
the Buddha emphasizes the need for discerning the true source. That it is an
injunction directly relevant to the practice is clearly expressed in the last
verse in the <em>Sūcilomasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye naṁ pajānanti yatonidānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te naṁ vinodenti, suṇohi yakkha,</em> <br />
<em>te duttaram ogham imaṁ taranti,</em> <br />
<em>atiṇṇapubbaṁ apunabbhavāya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn903-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn903">5</a></sup></p>
<p>And they that know wherefrom it springs, <br />
They dispel it, listen, O! Yakkha. <br />
They cross this flood so hard to cross, <br />
Never crossed before, to become no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary takes the term <em>yatonidānaṁ</em> in this verse as a reference to the
second noble truth of craving. The term <em>attasambhūta</em> is explained as ‘arisen
within oneself’, <em>attani sambhūtā</em>, but not much attention is given to
it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn904-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn904">6</a></sup> However, if we are to elicit the deeper meaning of these lines, we
have to take up for comment this term, occurring in the preceding verse.</p>
<p>We came across this term earlier, too, in our discussion of a verse in the
<em>Kosala Saṁyutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn905-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn905">7</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lobho, doso ca moho ca</em> <br />
<em>purisaṁ pāpacetasaṁ</em> <br />
<em>hiṁsanti attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>tacasāraṁ va samphalaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn906-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn906">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Greed and hate and delusion too, <br />
Sprung from within work harm on him <br />
Of evil wit, as does its fruit <br />
On the reed for which the bark is pith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, too, the term <em>attasambhūta</em> is mentioned. When we reflect
deeply on the significance of this term, we are first of all reminded of the
vortex simile we employed to explain the reciprocal relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form in our discussion of the law of dependent
arising as stated in the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em> at the very outset of this series of
sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn907-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn907">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Attasambhūta</em>, literally rendered, would mean ‘originating from oneself’. But
this so-called oneself conceived as a unit or centre of activity, is actually
based on a duality. The notion of a self is to be traced to an interrelation
between two conditions, that is, the reciprocal relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form, which we discussed earlier too.</p>
<p><em>Viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā viññāṇaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn908-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn908">10</a></sup> “dependent on
consciousness is name-and-form, dependent on name-and-form is consciousness”. As
the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī understood through radical reflection, consciousness
turns back from name-and-form, it does not go beyond, <em>paccudāvattati kho idaṁ
viññāṇaṁ nāmarūpamhā, nāparaṁ gacchati</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a vortex, a turning round. The delusion or ignorance is the
non-understanding of the reciprocal relationship between these two. The
understanding of it is the insight into the true source of all defilements.</p>
<p>To hark back to our simile of the chess game, this non-understanding is like the
split into two sides. The two friends quite amicably prepared the chess board
and the pieces. But for them to play the game, there should be two sides. It is
after this bifurcation and confrontation as two sides that the actual game
starts, with its vicissitudes of winning and losing.</p>
<p>Preparations grow yielding the consequences of wish fulfilments and
disappointments to the competitors. This is the norm underlying this
bifurcation. So ignorance is the non-understanding of the fact that the basis of
this <em>attasambhava</em> or springing up from within, namely, the dichotomy, is in
fact a mutual interrelation between two conditions.</p>
<p>In other words, the ignorance which gives rise to those preparations that go to
create the vortex between consciousness and name-and-form is the
non-understanding of the mutual interrelation implicit in this vortical
interplay. That is why one is instructed in insight meditation to reflect on
preparations relating to name-and-form. An insight into those preparations
reveals this mutual interrelation. There is such a dichotomy implicit in the
term <em>attasambhava.</em></p>
<p>The commentary explains the correlative <em>yathonidānaṁ</em>, ‘whence arising’, as a
reference to <em>taṇhā</em> or craving. But it is actually an allusion to ignorance.
The true source is non-understanding. That is why the Buddha, in presenting the
formula of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, went beyond craving and placed ignorance at the
head of the series of twelve links.</p>
<p>Very often, the commentators mention this as a possible point of controversy.
But the real reason for its precedence is the fact that ignorance is more
primary than craving as a condition. It is more basic than craving. When one
probes into the conditions for craving, one discovers ignorance as its root.</p>
<p>That is why, in stating the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> in the reverse order, the
Buddha used the expression <em>avijjāya tv’eva asesavirāganirodhā</em>, etc., “with the
remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance” etc.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn909-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn909">11</a></sup> It is with
the cessation of ignorance that the entire series of conditions move in the
opposite direction. So ignorance is primary as a condition.</p>
<p>We can explain this primacy in another way. Now <em>upādāna</em> is that grasping of
the object of craving. Actually it signifies a holding onto something. What
gives the impression that the object of craving is something that can be grasped
is a lack of a deep understanding of the principle of duality.</p>
<p>Craving finds something to hold onto precisely because one presumes that there
actually exists a thing to be grasped. That is how it gets object status. This
way, we can explain the basic reason for the recurrent birth in <em>saṁsāra</em> as the
non-understanding of the mutual interrelation between conditions. This sustains
the notion of a duality.</p>
<p>There is a verse in the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em> which throws more light on the
meaning of the term <em>attasambhava</em>. The verse, which is found also in the
section on the Eights in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, as well as in the <em>Udāna</em>, runs
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em> <br />
<em>bhavasaṅkhāram avassajī munī</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattarato samhāhito</em> <br />
<em>abhindi kavacam iv’attasambhavaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn910-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn910">12</a></sup></p>
<p>That preparation for becoming, <br />
The Sage gave up, <br />
Whence arise an ‘equal’ and an ‘unequal’, <br />
Inwardly rapt and concentrated, <br />
He split like an armour <br />
The origin of self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the spot called <em>cāpāla cetiya</em> the Buddha renounced the preparations
pertaining to the life span and declared that he will attain <em>parinibbāna</em> three
months hence. There was an earth tremor immediately afterwards and the Buddha
uttered this paean of joy to explain its significance.</p>
<p>However, this verse has puzzled many scholars, both eastern and western. The
commentators themselves are in a quandary. They advance alternative
interpretations, particularly in connection with the riddle-like terms <em>tulam
atulaṁ</em> as evidenced by the commentaries to the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> and <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn911-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn911">13</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the first interpretation given, <em>tulaṁ</em> stands for whatever
pertains to the sense-sphere, and <em>atulaṁ</em> refers to the fine-material and
immaterial spheres. The second interpretation, prefixed by an ‘or else’,
<em>athavā</em>, takes <em>tulaṁ</em> to mean both the sense-sphere and the fine-material
sphere and <em>atulaṁ</em> to refer only to the immaterial sphere. In a third
interpretation, <em>tulaṁ</em> is taken to mean ‘of little karmic result’, and <em>atulaṁ</em>
to mean ‘of great result’.</p>
<p>A fourth interpretation tries to tackle the difficult term in a different way
altogether: <em>’tulan’ti tulento tīrento, ’atulañ ca sambhavan’ti nibbānañ ceva
sambhavañ ca.</em> “<em>Tulaṁ</em> means comparing, determining, <em>atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em>
means Nibbāna and becoming.” Here the word <em>tulaṁ</em> is presumed to be a present
participle.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, <em>Nettippakaraṇa</em> advances yet another
interpretation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn912-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn912">14</a></sup> <em>’Tulan’ti saṅkhāradhātu, ’atulan’ti nibbānadhātu</em>,
“<em>tulaṁ</em> means <em>saṅkhāra</em>-element, <em>atulaṁ</em> means Nibbāna-element.”</p>
<p>It seems, however, that we have to approach the whole problem from a different
angle altogether. The twin term <em>tulam atulaṁ</em> most probably represents the
principle of duality we have discussed at length in this series of sermons.
<em>Tulaṁ</em> and <em>atulaṁ</em> in a pair-wise combination convey the idea of equality and
inequality as antonyms.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em> is suggestive of that dichotomy which
forms the basis of the self idea. <em>Attasambhava</em> or the origin of the
self-notion is traceable to this dichotomy, which is like the two friends
confronting each other in a game of chess. The two sides of the game may be
taken as two halves of the same thing, standing opposite to each other. This is
the ‘tragi-comedy’ of the situation. It is on these two halves or this dichotomy
that the origin of the notion of self is based.</p>
<p>A clear enunciation of this truth is found in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. For instance,
the following verse of the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> brings out the principle of
dichotomy rather rhetorically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Saccan’ti so brāhmaṇo kiṁ vadeyya</em> <br />
<em>’musā’ti vā so vivadetha kena</em> <br />
<em>yasmiṁ samaṁ visamañ cāpi natthi</em> <br />
<em>sa kena vādaṁ paṭisamyujeyya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn913-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn913">15</a></sup></p>
<p>What could that Brahmin speak of as ‘truth’, <br />
How could he debate calling something ‘false’, <br />
By what criterion could he, in whom there is no distinction <br />
Between equal and unequal, join issue in a debate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a similar verse in the <em>Attadaṇḍasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na samesu na omesu,</em> <br />
<em>na ussesu vadate muni</em> <br />
<em>santo so vītamaccharo</em> <br />
<em>nādeti na nirassati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn914-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn914">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The sage does not grade himself, <br />
Among equals, inferiors or superiors, <br />
Being at peace and with selfishness gone, <br />
He neither takes up nor throws away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again the issue is the triple conceit. It is by dispelling conceit that the
sage entertains no inclinations to grade himself among equals, inferiors or
superiors. Peaceful and unselfish as he is, he neither acquires nor rejects.
Here we see a reference to that dichotomy.</p>
<p>The same idea comes up in another guise in the following verse of the
<em>Tuvaṭakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which can be an incentive to the
recollection of peace, <em>upasamānussati</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ajjhattaṁ eva upasame,</em> <br />
<em>nāññato bhikkhu santiṁ eseyya</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattaṁ upasantassa</em> <br />
<em>natthi attaṁ, kuto nirattaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn915-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn915">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Let the monk inwardly calm himself, <br />
Let him not seek peace from outside, <br />
To one who is inwardly calm, <br />
There is nothing taken up or rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We came across the two terms <em>attaṁ nirattaṁ</em> earlier too, in our discussion of
a verse in the <em>Duṭṭhaṭṭhakasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn916-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn916">18</a></sup> There, the line <em>attaṁ nirattaṁ na
hi tassa atthi</em> meant the absence of the idea of taking up and rejecting in an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>Very often scholars interpret the term <em>attaṁ</em> in this context as ‘self’, which
in our opinion is incorrect. The phrase <em>nādeti na nirassati</em> gives a clear hint
as to the etymology of this term. It is derived from <em>dā</em> prefixed by <em>ā</em>,
giving <em>ādatta</em>, which by syncopation becomes <em>ātta</em>, which again by shortening
of the vowel comes as <em>atta</em>. <em>Niratta</em> is derived from <em>nirassati</em>.</p>
<p>These two terms, suggestive of a duality, remind us of the water pump we
mentioned in our discussion of the vortex.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn917-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn917">19</a></sup> There is nothing really
automatic even in a water pump, which takes in and throws out. Due to these two
aspects in the mechanism of a water pump, we call it a unit. From the point of
view of a water pump, it is capable of performing both functions. It is from
this point of view that we attribute a unitary significance to it. In this very
concept of a unit, one can discern the delusion involved.</p>
<p>Delusion is the apex of the vicious triangle greed, hate and delusion. Greed and
hate are the two feelers directed from the apex delusion. Though we regard them
as two functions, the taking in and throwing out are simply two aspects of the
same function. All this points to the depth of the idea of duality and to the
vortex simile, which our commentarial tradition seems to have ignored.</p>
<p>It is the same theme of duality that comes up in the first two lines of that
cryptic verse of the <em>Brāhmaṇa Vagga</em> in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, we had occasion to
quote earlier. <em>Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā, pārāpāraṁ na vijjati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn918-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn918">20</a></sup> To that
Brahmin, that is the <em>arahant</em>, there is neither a farther shore nor a hither
shore nor both. There is something extraordinary about this statement.</p>
<p>Against this background, we can now advance a plausible interpretation to the
puzzling verse we had quoted earlier in this discussion. The first two lines
could be understood as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ, bhavasaṅkhāram avassajī munī</em></p>
<p>The Sage renounced the preparations for becoming, which give rise to a
distinction between equal and unequal,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is to say, the Supreme Sage gave up those preparations productive of the
dichotomy between the concepts of equal and unequal.</p>
<p>Now the next two lines could be explained as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ajjhattarato samhāhito abhindi kavacam iv’attasambhavaṁ</em></p>
<p>Inwardly content and concentrated he broke up the point of origin of self like
an armour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This breaking up of the armour happened not at the moment he uttered this verse,
but at the moment he attained perfect enlightenment. Then what is the
provocation for making such a declaration at this juncture?</p>
<p>The Buddha renounced the preparations pertaining to the life span,
<em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, after several requests to that effect by Māra. It may seem that
the Buddha bowed down to Māra’s request and that he came under Māra’s sway when
he declared that the Tathāgata’s Parinibbāna will take place three months hence.
But the true implication of the verse in question is that the armour of Māra,
the armour of self-origin, <em>attasambhava</em>, has been broken down already and as
such he is not within the clutches of Māra.</p>
<p>Some scholars seem to identify this giving up of preparations for becoming,
<em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em>, with the renouncing of preparations pertaining to the lifespan,
<em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>. But there is a distinction between these two.</p>
<p>The former, that is <em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em>, are preparations productive of existence,
which go to build up a <em>bhava</em>. These the Buddha had already done away with by
breaching the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex between <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>nāmarūpa</em>. <em>Chinnaṁ
vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> “the whirlpool cut off whirls no more”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn919-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn919">21</a></sup> Those eddies
are no longer active in that consciousness.</p>
<p>Preparations pertaining to the life span, <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, have to be explained
differently. The term <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, mentioned in the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em>,
refers to the ability the Buddha possessed by virtue of developing the four
bases of success, <em>iddhipāda</em>, of lengthening his life span.</p>
<p>Because Venerable Ānanda did not invite him at the correct moment to make use of
that ability, he renounced it at <em>cāpāla cetiya</em>. That renouncing is compared in
that sutta itself to a vomiting. The Buddha tells Ānanda that it is not in the
nature of a Tathāgata to take in what he has already vomited, even for the sake
of life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn920-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn920">22</a></sup></p>
<p>So then, <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em> and <em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em> have to be distinguished between.
Preparations pertaining to the life span are not the same as preparations
productive of existence or becoming.</p>
<p>Understood in this way, it becomes clear that all the attachments, aversions and
delusions in the world stem from a non-understanding of the fact that the
duality we have discussed so far is actually an interrelation. It is as if the
two friends, who amicably prepared the chess board, forgot their friendship when
they confronted each other as two sides.</p>
<p>This duality is a very subtle problem. The Buddha has pointed out how to resolve
it through understanding by means of various meditation techniques. Perhaps the
best illustration is the meditative attention by way of elements as stated in
the suttas. We have already mentioned about this to some extent in a previous
sermon while discussing the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn921-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn921">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If we are to analyse this technique of meditative attention by way of elements
from a practical point of view, we may cite the relevant section from the
<em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em> preached by Venerable Sāriputta. Addressing his fellow
monks, Venerable Sāriputta says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamā c’āvuso paṭhavīdhātu? Paṭhavīdhātu siyā ajjhattikā siyā bāhirā. Katamā
c’āvuso ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu? Yaṁ ajjhattaṁ paccattaṁ kakkhaḷaṁ kharigataṁ
upādiṇṇaṁ, seyyathīdaṁ kesā lomā nakhā dantā taco maṁsaṁ nahāru aṭṭhī
aṭṭhimiñjā vakkaṁ hadayaṁ yakanaṁ kilomakaṁ pihakaṁ papphāsaṁ antaṁ antaguṇaṁ
udariyaṁ karīsaṁ, yaṁ vā pan’aññam pi kiñci ajjhattaṁ paccattaṁ kakkhaḷaṁ
kharigataṁ upādiṇṇaṁ, ayaṁ vuccat’āvuso ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu.</em></p>
<p><em>Yā c’eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu
paṭhavīdhāturev’esā. Taṁ netaṁ mama neso ’ham asmi, na meso attā’ti evam
etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ. Evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
disvā paṭhavīdhatuyā nibbindati, paṭhavīdhatuyā cittaṁ virājeti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn922-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn922">24</a></sup></p>
<p>What, Friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be either internal
or external. What, Friends, is the internal earth element? Whatever is
internal, belonging to oneself, hard, solid and clung to, that is, head hairs,
body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney,
heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines,
contents of the stomach, faeces, or whatever else is internal, belonging to
oneself, hard, solid and clung to, this is called, Friends, the internal earth
element.</p>
<p>Now whatever is the internal earth element and whatever is the external earth
element, both are simply the earth element; and that should be seen as it
actually is with right wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self.’ Having seen it as it actually is with right wisdom, one becomes
disenchanted with the earth element, becomes dispassionate towards the earth
element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta has not given here instances of the external earth element,
because it is obvious enough, that is: whatever is external to the body.</p>
<p>A statement that is of paramount importance here is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā c’eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu
paṭhavīdhāturev’esā</em>,</p>
<p>now whatever is the internal element and whatever is the external earth
element, both are simply the earth element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When regarded as earth element, both are the same. This is the premise from
which insight takes off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That should be seen as it actually is with right wisdom thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this insight into the earth element with right wisdom one gets disenchanted
with it and becomes dispassionate.</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier too, the term <em>virāga</em>, usually rendered by
‘detachment’ or ‘dispassion’, has a nuance suggestive of a ‘fading
away’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn923-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn923">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Here the verb <em>virājeti</em> clearly brings out that nuance. Thus <em>paṭhavīdhatuyā
cittaṁ virājeti</em> seems to imply something like “he makes the earth element fade
away from his mind”.</p>
<p>We have already quoted such instances as <em>pītiyā ca virāgā</em>, “with the fading
away of joy”, and <em>avijjāvirāgā</em>, “with the fading away of ignorance”, to
highlight this nuance of the term <em>virāga</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, too, it seems the function of disenchantment, <em>nibbidā</em>, is to
see that whatever colour the earth element had infused in the mind is made to
fade away. It is a detachment as well as a decolouration.</p>
<p>What, then, is the true purpose of resolving the distinction between internal
and external with regard to the earth element? The purpose is the breaking up of
the foundation for cravings, conceits and views.</p>
<p>For ‘me’ to acquire some object out of craving that object has to exist apart
from ‘me’ and ‘I’ have to stand apart from it. The statement ‘this is mine’
presupposes a duality between ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Similarly, the statement ‘this am
I’, expressive of conceit, smacks of duality.</p>
<p>For instance, one gazing at a mirror is imperceptibly involved in this duality
when he tries to compare his face with its reflection on the mirror. This is the
irony of the situation in ordinary life. But what we have here, in this sutta,
is the opposite viewpoint. Not: ‘this is mine’, not: ‘this am I’, not: ‘this is
my self’.</p>
<p>What fosters this opposite point of view is the very absence of the distinction
between the internal and the external. The fundamental basis for acquisition or
measuring is gone. It is as if the unending game of chess with all its
vicissitudes has ended in a peaceful draw.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, our entire <em>saṁsāric</em> existence is a chess game between the
organic, <em>upādiṇṇa</em>, and the inorganic, <em>anupādiṇṇa</em>. For instance, the four
elements within this body, the grasped par excellence, or the clung to, and the
four elements as nutrition and atmosphere are always in conflict in their game
of chess. This chess game has as its vicissitudes the disturbances of the three
humours wind, bile and phlegm, on the physical side, and greed, hate and
delusion on the mental side.</p>
<p>These disturbances are to a great extent the outcome of this false dichotomy.
The task before a meditator, therefore, is the resolving of this conflict by a
penetrative understanding of the mutual interrelation between the two sides,
internal and external. When the gap between the two is removed, the mind becomes
equanimous.</p>
<p>We are told that the contemplation of the four elements is an effective means of
developing equanimity. Among the parts of our body, there are some we pride on
and cherish, some others, like excreta and urine, we abhor and detest. When
regarded as mere elements, attachment and revulsion give place to equanimity.
The description of the contemplation on elements, as found in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, clearly illustrates this fact. The relevant section runs as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puna ca paraṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ
dhātuso paccavekkhati: Atthi imasmiṁ kāye paṭhavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu
vāyodhātū’ti.</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, dakkho goghātako vā goghātakantevāsī vā gāviṁ vadhitvā
cātummahāpathe bilaso paṭivibhajitvā nisinno assa; evaṁ eva kho, bhikkhave,
bhikkhu imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ dhātuso paccavekkhati: Atthi
imasmiṁ kāye paṭhavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn924-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn924">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, monks, a monk reflects on this same body as it stands and as it is
disposed as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are the earth
element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element’.</p>
<p>Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow were seated
at the crossroads with it cut up into small pieces, so, too, a monk reflects
on this same body as it stands and as it is disposed as consisting of elements
thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the monk is instructed to reflect on this same body as it
stands and as it is disposed, <em>imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ</em>. These
words are particularly significant, in that they do not imply an atomistic or
microscopic analysis. The four elements are already there in the body, and
though it is mentioned in brief here, in other discourses the organic instances
for each of them are described at length.</p>
<p>The simile used in connection with this analysis is highly significant. When a
butcher or his apprentice kills a cow, cuts it into small pieces and sits at the
crossroads ready to sell the meat, he is no longer particular about the cow from
which it came. He is conscious of it merely as a heap of meat. Similarly, the
contemplation by way of elements inculcates an equanimous attitude.</p>
<p>Just as the distinction between the <em>upādiṇṇa</em> and the <em>anupādiṇṇa</em> is
suggestive of the duality between the organic and the inorganic, the distinction
between <em>ajjhatta</em> and <em>bahiddhā</em> has relevance to the duality between one’s own
and another’s. This aspect of the reflection on elements emerges in the summary
like section that follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti ajjhattaṁ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati, bahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī
viharati, ajjhattabahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati</em>,</p>
<p>in this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he
abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating
the body as a body both internally and externally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, too, the aim is to break down the dichotomy between one’s own and
another’s. This contemplation is of a purpose to the extent that by it one
realizes the fact that, whether internal or external, it is just the four
elements. This norm is succinctly expressed as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yathā idaṁ tathā etaṁ, yathā etaṁ tathā idaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn925-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn925">27</a></sup></p>
<p>just as this, so is that; just as that, so is this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our minds are obsessed by the perception of diversity, <em>nānattasaññā</em>. According
to colour and form, we distinguish objects in the outside world and give them
names. It is a burden or a strain to the mind. The reflection by way of elements
as given in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> could even be appreciated as a step towards
the perception of unity, <em>ekattasaññā</em>, from this grosser perception of
diversity. It tends to relaxation and unification of the mind.</p>
<p>So the purpose of this reflection by way of the elements, peculiar to the
discourses, is to look upon the elements as void, in accordance with the
Buddha’s advice, <em>dhātuyo suññato passa</em>, “look upon the elements as
void”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn926-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn926">28</a></sup></p>
<p>However, for some reason or other, perhaps due to the influence of some Indian
schools of philosophy with a slant towards materialism, some Buddhist sects
indulged in academic subtleties which seem to obsess the mind with the four
elements with concepts about them, instead of the simpler reflection on elements
characteristic of the suttas. Originally the purpose was to erase the four
elements from the mind.</p>
<p>The original purpose was to make the four elements, the amorphous primaries
which masquerade as form in the minds of beings for incalculable aeons, to fade
away from the mind. But what happened later was to revel in atomistic analyses,
which more or less followed the way of thinking peculiar to materialism. It
ended up in hair-splitting analyses even literally, painting for instance the
earth element all the more vividly in the mind. We have to assess this academic
trend against the original purpose, unbiased by the traditional predilection for
it. It is no exaggeration to say that all this tended to obscure the path to
Nibbāna in the course of time.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s ‘research’ was something entirely different. His ‘research’ into
the four elements took a completely different course. In the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> the Buddha proclaims the results of his research into the
four elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, assādapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yo paṭhavīdhatuyā
assādo tad ajjhagamaṁ, yāvatā paṭhavīdhātuyā assādo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho.</em></p>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, ādīnavapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yo paṭhavīdhatuyā
ādīnavo tad ajjhagamaṁ, yavatā paṭhavīdhātuyā ādīnavo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho.</em></p>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, nissaraṇapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yaṁ paṭhavīdhatuyā
nissaraṇaṁ tad ajjhagamaṁ, yavatā paṭhavīdhātuyā nissaraṇaṁ paññāya me taṁ
sudiṭṭhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn927-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn927">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the gratification in the earth element. Whatever
gratification there is in the earth element, that have I found out; whatever
is the range of the gratification of the earth element, that have I well
discerned with wisdom.</p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the danger in the earth element. Whatever danger
there is in the earth element, that have I found out; whatever is the range of
the danger of the earth element, that have I well discerned with wisdom.</p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the stepping out from the earth element. Whatever
stepping out there is from the earth element, that have I found out; whatever
is the range of the stepping out from the earth element, that have I well
discerned with wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is the Buddha’s research into the earth element. The discourse goes on
to state the same fact with regard to the other three elements.</p>
<p>The term <em>assāda</em>, mentioned in this sutta, is defined as the bodily pleasure
and mental happiness, <em>sukhaṁ somanassaṁ</em>, arising due to the earth element. The
danger in the earth element is its impermanent, suffering and changing nature,
<em>aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā</em>. The stepping out from it is the disciplining
and abandonment of desire for it, <em>chandarāgavinayo chandarāgappahānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It is on the strength of this research that the Buddha even enjoined the
reflection on the four requisites. The <em>Ariyavaṁsasutta</em> makes this sufficiently
clear. In connection with the modes of reflection on the use of the four
requisites, a thematic phrase occurs which is highly significant in this
concern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Laddhā ca piṇḍapātaṁ agathito amucchito anajjhāpanno ādīnavadassāvī
nissaraṇapañño paribhuñjati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn928-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn928">30</a></sup></p>
<p>On getting alms food he partakes of it without greed, uninfatuated,
unenslaved, being aware of the danger in it, with the wisdom in stepping out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terms <em>agathito amucchito anajjhāpanno</em>, “without greed, uninfatuated,
unenslaved”, are suggestive of the gratification which one has to withstand.</p>
<p>The term <em>ādīnavadassāvī</em>, “being aware of the danger”, is suggestive of
overeating and other possible risks in taking food.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression <em>nissaraṇapañño</em>, “with the wisdom in stepping
out”, in the highest sense is taking food with the deeper idea of abandoning
food in accordance with the cryptic dictum <em>āhāraṁ nissāya āhāraṁ pajahati</em>,
“gives up food depending on food”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn929-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn929">31</a></sup></p>
<p>It should be clear from the foregoing what the original idea behind the
contemplation on the elements was and what happened later. The later trends seem
to have ignored the fact that perception is a mirage. Research into these four
elements is a matter for the physicist, though it is like chasing a mirage with
thoughts and concepts. What is needed is the liberation of the mind from the
perception of form that is ingrained in the minds of beings due to the four
elements in this long <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>All the meditation techniques the Buddha has taught are directed towards the
fading away of this perception of form. Because of these four primaries we have
a perception of form, which enables us to take signs. All the four are actually
impermanent, but the perceptual data we have gathered dependent on them are
indelibly imprinted on our minds.</p>
<p>Signs taken up in the far distant past in one’s <em>saṁsāra</em> can come up again and
again as attachments and aversions to perpetuate one’s <em>saṁsāric</em> existence. The
thoughts and prolific concepts arise out of this perception of form.</p>
<p>In other words, we distinguish between one thing and another according to colour
and shape. By evaluating them through attachments and aversions, we allow them
to get deeply rooted in our mind. These are the latencies to perception, which
in the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> find mention in the expression <em>saññā nānusenti</em>,
“perceptions do not lie latent”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn930-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn930">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Whereas the <em>arahant</em> does away with these latencies, the <em>non-arahant</em>
entertains them to some extent or other. These latencies account for the
prolific concepts with which beings heap up <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering. In order to
loosen the hold of these signs on our minds, the perilous aspect of the four
elements has to be emphasized.</p>
<p>That is why the Buddha in a number of discourses described to the monks the
impermanence of the four elements. It was not his intention to encourage any
atomistic analysis. He preached about the impermanence of the four elements to
expose the hollowness and vanity of this drama of existence – to erase the
perception of form, productive of this drama, from the minds of beings.</p>
<p>Now <em>saṅkhāra</em> is a term we often come across in the Dhamma. We happened to
suggest a possible nuance of the term, when we brought up similes relating to
the cinema and the theatre. <em>Saṅkhāra</em> is a term capable of comprehending the
entire range of preparations that go to make up a theatrical performance.</p>
<p>Now the Buddha has related the story of this great earth in some discourses. But
it is not an account of a scientific experiment, as our modern day scientists
would offer. The Buddha describes how this great earth came up and how it gets
destroyed in order to drive home into our minds the impermanence of the very
stage on which we enact our <em>saṁsāric</em> drama, thereby inculcating an attitude of
disenchantment and dispassion, <em>nibbidā</em> and <em>virāga</em>.</p>
<p>These <em>saṅkhāras</em>, pertaining to our drama of existence on this gigantic stage,
the earth, get deeply imprinted in our minds. They sink deep as latencies to
perception, productive of existence. It is to eradicate them that the Buddha has
placed before us the story of this great earth in some discourses. By far the
best illustration comes in the <em>Aggaññasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>According to it, at the beginning of this aeon the earth was immersed in a
darkness and covered with water. The inhabitants were those who had come down
from the Ābhassara Brahma World. They were sex-less, mind-made, feeding on joy,
self-luminous and capable of moving through the air, <em>manomayā, pītibhakkhā
sayampabhā antalikkhacarā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn931-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn931">33</a></sup></p>
<p>After billions and billions of years, a savoury earth spread itself over the
waters, like the tissue that forms over hot milk as it cools. It was very sweet
and tempting. Some being of a greedy nature, exclaiming: “Ah! What can this
be?”, tasted this savoury earth with his finger. Craving arose in him as a
result of it. Others who saw him doing it did the same.</p>
<p>Then they all began digging into the savoury earth with their hands and eating
it, with the result that their subtle bodies became gross, hard and solid.
Craving also increased, and their minds became rougher and coarser. The
environment changed in unison, becoming grosser and grosser. So we have here the
perilous aspect. As the perils became manifest, the watery earth grew in
solidity and the simple life grew in complexity.</p>
<p>Billions and billions of years passed until the earth assumed its present shape
and appearance with all its gigantic mountains, rocks and buildings. But then,
in the <em>Sattasuriyasutta</em> of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, the Buddha describes what
happens to this great earth at the end of the aeon.</p>
<p>As the holocaust draws near, a second orb of the sun appears, and then a third,
a fourth, a fifth, a sixth and a seventh. The great earth in its entirety,
together with its mountains and rocks, goes ablaze, becoming just one huge flame
of fire, consuming all before it without leaving any ash or soot, like in a spot
where oil or ghee had burnt. So here we have no room for any atomism. In
conclusion the Buddha brings out the true aim and purpose of this discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ aniccā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā, evaṁ addhuvā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā, evaṁ
anassāsikā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā. Yāvañcidaṁ, bhikkhave, alam eva
sabbasaṅkhāresu nibbindituṁ alaṁ virajjituṁ alaṁ vimuccituṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn932-1"><a href="sermon-28.html#fn-fn932">34</a></sup></p>
<p>So impermanent, monks, are preparations, so unstable, monks, are preparations,
so unsatisfying, monks, are preparations. So much so, monks, this is enough to
get disenchanted with preparations, this is enough to get dispassionate with
them, this is enough to get released from them.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the twenty-ninth sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>We made an attempt, in our last sermon, to highlight the impermanence of the
stage trappings which from the beginning of an aeon to its end this great earth
stage presents for the drama of existence of <em>saṁsāric</em> beings, enacted on it.
Putting side by side in vivid contrast to each other, the description of the
beginning of the aeon, as given in the <em>Aggaññasutta</em>, and the description of
the destruction of the aeon, in the <em>Sattasuriyasutta</em>, we tried to arouse a
powerful perception of impermanence, leading to disenchantment, which is the key
to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>A resonant echo of these discourses of the Buddha, suggestive of the
impermanence of this drama of existence and the earth stage on which it is
enacted, comes to us through the <em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em>, preached by the
venerable Sāriputta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassā hi nāma āvuso bāhirāya paṭhavīdhātuyā tāva mahallikāya aniccatā
paññāyissati, khayadhammatā paññāyissati, vayadhammatā paññāyissati,
vipariṇāmadhammatā paññāyissati, kiṁ pan’ imassa mattaṭṭhakassa kāyassa
taṇhupādiṇṇassa ahan’ti vā maman’ti vā asmī’ti vā, atha khvāssa no t’ ev’
ettha hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn934-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn934">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Even of this external earth element, Friends, great as it is, an impermanence
will become manifest, a liability to destruction will become manifest, a
liability to waste away will become manifest, a liability to undergo change
will become manifest, what to say of this ephemeral body clung to by craving
as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘am’? On the other hand there is no justification for such
a clinging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pithy paragraph of the discourse is eloquent proof of the fact that it is
possible to dispel the latencies to conceit leading to ‘I’-ing and ‘mine’-ning
by penetrating into the impermanence of this puny internal earth element through
the broader perspective of the impermanence of the vast external earth element.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Animittañca bhāvehi, mānānusayamujjaha,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn935-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn935">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Develop the signless, too, and give up the latency to conceit!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was the advice the Buddha gave to venerable Rāhula in the <em>Rāhulasutta</em> of the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. It is clear from this advice that, when signs fade away through
the perception of impermanence, latencies to conceit also lose their hold on the
mind.</p>
<p>Instead of pervertly exploiting the canonical discourses describing the
impermanence of the external world with wrong reflection in order to indulge in
worldly speculation, we should arouse radical reflection and project them into
our own internal world in order to understand the vanity of this drama of life.</p>
<p>Where are the actors and actresses who played their part in the early acts of
our drama of life? Where are those stage decorations and trappings? Though they
are no more, so long as latencies to perception, amassed through them, persist
in us, there is nothing to prevent us from indulging in thoughts and
proliferations. When we reflect on the impermanence of the entire world, we get
dispassionate about the heap of preparations in our drama of life, reckoned in
terms of objects, events and persons.</p>
<p>When dispassion sets in, signs fade away, like in a blurred water-colour
painting. For a meditator, developing the perception of impermanence, the world
might appear like an indistinct water-painting, with blotches of colour.</p>
<p>When the figures in the painting cannot be distinguished according to colour and
shape, there is less room for the perception of diversity, <em>nānattasaññā</em>.
Thereby latencies to conceit, which give rise to divisions and conflicts are
also attenuated. That is why the Buddha always reminds us of the perception of
impermanence as an important subject of meditation. He has recommended in
particular the signless concentration, for instance in the <em>Khandhasaṁyutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tayome, bhikkhave, akusalavitakkā: kāmavitakko, byāpādavitakko,
vihiṁsāvitakko. Ime ca, bhikkhave, tayo akusalavitakkā kva aparisesā
nirujjhanti? Catūsu vā satipaṭṭhānesu supatiṭṭhita-cittassa animittaṁ vā
samādhiṁ bhāvayato. Yāvañcidaṁ, bhikkhave, alam eva animitto samādhi
bhāvetuṁ. Animitto, bhikkhave, samādhi bhāvito bahulīkato mahapphalo hoti
mahānisaṁso.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn936-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn936">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three kinds of unskilful thoughts: sensual thoughts,
thoughts of ill-will, thoughts of harming. And where, monks, do these three
unskilful thoughts cease without remainder? For one who dwells with the mind
well attended by the four foundations of mindfulness, or for one who develops
the signless concentration. So much so that this is reason enough for one to
develop the signless concentration. Monks, when the signless concentration is
developed and cultivated it is of great fruit, of great benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this quotation it becomes clear, that there are two methods of making the
three kinds of unskilful thoughts cease without residue. The first method is to
have a mind well attended by the four foundations of mindfulness. The second
method is the development of the signless concentration.</p>
<p>The particle <em>vā</em>, ‘or’, shows that it is an alternative. It seems, therefore,
that by developing the signless concentration these thoughts and concepts do not
get an opportunity, due to the very fact that signs fade away.</p>
<p>It is because of our <em>saṁsāric</em> habit of taking in signs that thoughts and
proliferations arise in us. But even in our endeavour to liberate our minds from
thoughts and proliferations, we cannot help resorting to a particular mode of
taking in signs. One cannot do without them altogether.</p>
<p>We have often mentioned the reason why the Buddha proclaimed a middle path. It
is in the nature of some things that, though they have to be given up, they
cannot be fully dispensed with. So the middle path has also to be a gradual
path, <em>anupubbapaṭipadā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn937-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn937">5</a></sup> The middle path itself becomes a gradual path,
because there has to be a graded system in the course of practice to be
followed.</p>
<p>If we are to present the fundamental idea behind these two terms, the ‘middle
path’ and the ‘gradual path’, we may say that the course of practice leading to
Nibbāna is in principle both <strong>pragmatic</strong> and <strong>relative</strong>.</p>
<p>It is pragmatic in the sense that it has a practical value, as it is directed
towards some goal. It is relative to the extent that the stages that go to make
up the path have no absolute value in themselves. Each stage has only a relative
value, being of significance in relation to the next stage. Every stage in the
graded path is dependent and relative.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion, we happened to mention the simile of the relay of
chariots in the <em>Rathavinītasutta.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn938-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn938">6</a></sup> Like stage coaches, the chariots run
relative to each other. It is an illustration of the principle of relativity.</p>
<p>So even in the attempt to liberate the mind from its hold on signs, we cannot
help making use of a particular set of signs. In that attempt, we have to be
guided by the first principles of relativity and pragmatism.</p>
<p>In order to explain these first principles, we made use of a certain simile in
one of our earlier sermons. The simile is: sharpening a razor.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn939-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn939">7</a></sup> To
refresh our memory, the main purpose of bringing up this simile was to show the
difference between meditative reflection, <em>sammasana</em>, and dogmatic adherence,
<em>parāmasana</em>. Whereas <em>parāmasana</em> means tenacious grasping, <em>sammasana</em> is a
particular way of holding lightly for some subtle purpose. We took up the razor
simile to illustrate the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>If one grabs the razor roughly and moves it up and down the whetstone, it would
get blunt. But if one catches hold of the razor in a relaxed nonchalant way, and
mindfully sweeps the whetstone back and forth, it would get sharpened.</p>
<p>This way of reflection on preparations, or <em>saṅkhārā</em>, reminds us of the two
terms <em>vipassanā</em>, insight, and <em>anupassanā</em>, contemplation, which again are
relevant to the theme of pragmatism and relativity.</p>
<p>As an illustration, let us take the case of a carpenter, planing a piece of
wood. In the process of planing, from time to time he might hold up the piece of
wood to his left eye, and with his right eye closed might give it a critical
glance. There is something sinister about this way of looking. It is as if an
expert is directing a fault-finding critical glance on the work of an inexpert.
But here it is the carpenter himself looking at his own artefact. Why does he do
so? He is himself playing the role of a critic, in order to find out his
shortcomings as a carpenter. If he complacently looks at it with excessive
self-confidence, he can never rectify his errors and improve himself.</p>
<p>In the two terms <em>vipassanā</em> and <em>anupassanā</em> we have a special way of seeing
that is penetrative as well as contemplative. It is, in short, an <strong>objective
approach to understand the subjective in one’s experience, with a view to
attaining perfection</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <em>Theragāthā</em> we find Venerable Mahā Moggallāna Thera stating the purpose
of this special way of seeing in the following verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sukhumaṁ paṭivijjhanti</em> <br />
<em>vālaggam usunā yathā</em> <br />
<em>ye pañcakkhandhe passanti</em> <br />
<em>parato no ca attato.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn940-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn940">8</a></sup></p>
<p>They penetrate into that which is subtle, <br />
Like a horse’s hair with an arrow, <br />
Who look upon the aggregates five, <br />
As something alien, not their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakulā Therī in the <em>Therīgāthā</em> voices something similar in the following
verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saṅkhāre parato disvā</em> <br />
<em>hetujāte palokine</em> <br />
<em>pahāsiṁ āsave sabbe</em> <br />
<em>sītibhūta’mhi nibbutā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn941-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn941">9</a></sup></p>
<p>By seeing as alien all preparations, <br />
As causally arisen and fragile, <br />
I have given up all influxes, <br />
Become cool and extinguished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the discourses, personality view or <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em> is described in such
terms as <em>rūpaṁ attato samanupassati</em>, “he looks upon form as self”, and
<em>vedanaṁ attato samanupassati</em>, “he looks upon feeling as self”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn942-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn942">10</a></sup></p>
<p>That is the way with the worlding, untaught in the Dhamma. But the noble
disciple, who has heard the Dhamma, particularly the one who meditates, makes
use of this looking upon as alien, <em>parato</em>. That is how his way of seeing
becomes an in-sight, <em>vipassanā</em>, a contemplation, <em>anupassanā</em>.</p>
<p>The term <em>anupassanā</em> as a particular mode of seeing in accordance occurs in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> in a way that has puzzled many a scholar. Phrases like <em>kāye
kāyānupassī viharati</em> and <em>vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati</em> seem to defy
translation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn943-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn943">11</a></sup> “In the body he dwells seeing in accordance with the body”.</p>
<p>What is this ‘seeing in accordance’? That is what the carpenter is doing. This
meditative carpenter, too, has to direct a critical glance at the preparations
in order to find out their shortcomings. He has to look upon them as alien,
<em>parato</em>. That is the significance of the expression <em>kāye kāyānupassī</em>.</p>
<p>If he starts off with the prejudice “this is my body, what is wrong with this?”,
there is little chance that he will see its shortcomings, its impermanent,
suffering, not-self characteristics.</p>
<p>If he is to see them, he has to adjust his point of view. He has to look upon
the body as alien, <em>parato</em>. From this alien point of view, the meditative
carpenter not only discovers the shortcomings in his artefact, but also adopts a
technique of planing to smoothen out the rough edges.</p>
<p>What are these rough edges? The protuberances of craving, conceits and views.
Though this is a pure heap of preparations, <em>suddhasaṅkhārapuñjo</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn944-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn944">12</a></sup> as
Venerable Vajirā calls it, there are three protuberances, three rough edges to
be planed down in the form of craving, conceit and views. To smoothen them out,
the meditative carpenter resorts to a kind of planing. Let us now listen to the
sound of his planing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na etaṁ mama, na eso ’ham asmi, na me so attā.</em> <br />
<em>Na etaṁ mama, na eso ’ham asmi, na me so attā.</em> <br />
<em>Na etaṁ mama, na eso ’ham asmi, na me so attā.</em></p>
<p>Not: ‘this is mine’, not: ‘this am I’, not: ‘this is my self’. <br />
Not: ‘this is mine’, not: ‘this am I’, not: ‘this is my self’. <br />
Not: ‘this is mine’, not: ‘this am I’, not: ‘this is my self’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this sharp ‘not’, <em>na</em>, that cuts away the protruding defilements. So it
seems that these phrases are not mentioned in the discourses for the purpose of
grasping them as some sort of dogmatic formula. They have a pragmatic and
relative value for the meditator in his planing to do away with those rough
edges.</p>
<p>In this context, we may allude to the term <em>ussada</em>, which is particularly
relevant to the theme. This term comes up in some discourses, but its meaning is
not quite clear. It seems to imply something that comes up as a protuberance or
a swelling, something that surfaces and shows up. Cravings, conceits and views
are such swellings or protuberances which show up from this heap of
preparations. These swellings have to be planed down.</p>
<p>A verse in the <em>Tuvaṭakasutta</em> of the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> is
suggestive of these nuances of the term <em>ussada</em>. It is a verse that can be used
even for reflecting on the peace of Nibbāna, <em>upasamānussati</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe yathā samuddassa</em> <br />
<em>ūmi na jāyatī, ṭhito hoti</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ ṭhito anej’assa</em> <br />
<em>ussadaṁ bhikkhu na kareyya kuhiñci.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn945-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn945">13</a></sup></p>
<p>As in mid-ocean no waves arise, <br />
And it is all steady and motionless, <br />
So unmoved and steady let the monk be, <br />
Let him not form any swelling anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse, by contrast, insinuates that the worldling’s mind is much nearer the
seashore, where ripples turn into waves and furious breakers. In mid-ocean there
is not that fury, there are no waves or ripples. It is all calm and peaceful
there.</p>
<p>So the meditative carpenter has to plane down the rugged surfaces with
insightful contemplation, until those cravings, conceits and views that show up
are smoothened out and only a pure heap of preparations, <em>suddhasaṅkhārapuñjo</em>,
remains.</p>
<p>How the principle of relativity is applicable to this meditative planing down,
in accordance with the concept of a gradual path of practice,
<em>anupubbapaṭipadā</em>, is beautifully illustrated by the <em>Sakkapañhasutta</em> of the
<em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>This planing down the rough surface of thoughts and proliferations has to be
done gradually and systematically. Even a carpenter, while planing a piece of
wood, has to adjust his instrument from time to time in the course of planing.
He might even pick up another plane when the surface gets smoother. The planing
down of thoughts and proliferations, as a fading away of signs, is a gradual
process.</p>
<p>The <em>Sakkapañhasutta</em> provides us with a good illustration of it in the form of
a dialogue between Sakka, the king of gods, and the Buddha. The dialogue was so
pithy and deep, that at the end of it Sakka attained the fruit of
stream-winning. The first question that is relevant to our discussion, is worded
as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chando pana, mārisa, kiṁnidāno kiṁsamudayo kiṁjātiko kiṁpabhavo; kismīm sati
chando hoti, kismiṁ asati chando na hoti?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn946-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn946">14</a></sup></p>
<p>What, dear sir, is the cause of desire, what is its arising, what is it born
of, what is its origin? When what is there, does desire come to be; when what
is not there, does desire not come to be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s answer was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chando kho, devānaminda, vitakkanidāno vitakkasamudayo vitakkajātiko
vitakkapabhavo; vitakke sati chando hoti, vitakke asati chando na hoti</em>.</p>
<p>Desire, O King of Gods, has thinking as its cause, it arises with thinking, it
has thinking as its origin. When thinking is there, desire comes to be; when
thinking is not there, desire does not come to be!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, Sakka asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the cause, the arising and the origin of thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the Buddha replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reckonings born of prolific perception (<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>), O King of Gods,
is the cause, the arising and the origin of thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then it seems that reckonings born of prolific perception,
<em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, is the cause of thinking. We happened to discuss this
particular term at length in our analysis of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn947-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn947">15</a></sup>
The term <em>papañca</em> actually stands for a proliferation of thoughts, of cravings,
conceits and views. Now <em>saṅkhā</em> has the sense of ‘reckoning’ or ‘designation’.
The Buddha’s reply therefore implies that thinking arises based on those
designations.</p>
<p>The next question of Sakka is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁ paṭipanno pana, mārisa, bhikkhu
papañcasaññāsaṅkhānirodhasāruppagāminīpaṭipadaṁ paṭipanno hotī’ti?</em></p>
<p>How has a monk to set out, dear sir, so as to become one who is treading the
path of practice conducive to the cessation of reckonings born of prolific
perception?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s answer to this question is directly relevant to our understanding
of the gradual path, <em>anupubbapaṭipadā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Somanassam p’ahaṁ, devānaminda, duvidhena vadāmi, sevitabbam pi asevitabbam
pi. Domanassam p’ahaṁ, devānaminda, duvidhena vadāmi, sevitabbam pi
asevitabbam pi. Upekham p’ahaṁ, devānaminda, duvidhena vadāmi, sevitabbam pi
asevitabbam pi.</em></p>
<p>Even happiness, O King of Gods, I speak of as being of two kinds: one to be
pursued, the other not to be pursued. Even unhappiness, O King of Gods, I
speak of as being of two kinds: one to be pursued, the other not to be
pursued. Even equanimity, O King of Gods, I speak of as being of two kinds:
one to be pursued, the other not to be pursued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha goes on to explain it further as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tattha yaṁ jaññā somanassaṁ: imaṁ kho me somanassaṁ sevato akusalā dhammā
abhivaḍḍhanti, kusalā dhammā parihāyantīti, evarūpaṁ somanassaṁ na sevitabbaṁ.
Tattha yaṁ jaññā somanassaṁ: imaṁ kho me somanassaṁ sevato akusalā dhammā
parihāyanti, kusalā dhammā abhivaḍḍhantīti, evarūpaṁ somanassaṁ sevitabbaṁ.
Tattha yañ ce savitakkaṁ savicāraṁ, yañ ce avitakkaṁ avicāraṁ, ye avitakke
avicāre se paṇītatare.</em></p>
<p>Out of them, whatever happiness about which one knows: “while pursuing this
happiness unskilful thoughts grow and skilful thoughts decline”, that kind of
happiness should not be pursued. Out of them, whatever happiness about which
one knows: “while pursuing this happiness unskilful thoughts decline and
skilful thoughts grow”, that kind of happiness should be pursued. And there,
too, of that happiness which is accompanied by thinking and pondering, and of
that which is not accompanied by thinking and pondering, whatever is not
accompanied by thinking and pondering is the more excellent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this we can infer the fact that the happiness unaccompanied by thinking and
pondering is nearer to Nibbāna. This is the criterion we can glean from this
discussion.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Buddha goes on to analyze unhappiness as being twofold. Out
of them, that which is productive of unskilful thoughts should be avoided, and
that which is productive of skilful thoughts should be pursued. But therein,
too, that which is unaccompanied by thinking and pondering is declared as more
excellent than that which is accompanied by thinking and pondering. That is the
path to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>So also is the case with regard to the analysis of equanimity. Therein, that
equanimity productive of skilful thoughts has to be pursued, subject to the
proviso that equanimity unaccompanied by thinking and pondering is more
excellent than that which is so accompanied.</p>
<p>In summing up, the Buddha concludes the explanation with the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ paṭipanno kho, devanam inda, bhikkhu
papañcasaññāsaṅkhānirodhasāruppagāminipaṭipadaṁ paṭipanno hoti.</em></p>
<p>It is a monk who has thus set out, O King of Gods, who is treading the path of
practice conducive to the cessation of reckonings born of prolific
perceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then, this discourse is one that is highly significant from a pragmatic point
of view.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little problem might crop up here. In our discussion of the
<em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> in an earlier sermon, we came across the following
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ vitakketi taṁ papañceti, yaṁ papañceti tatonidānaṁ purisaṁ
papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti …</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn948-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn948">16</a></sup></p>
<p>What one reasons about, one proliferates; what one proliferates, owing to that
reckonings born of prolific perception beset him …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently there is a contradiction between this statement in the
<em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> and the above quoted reply by the Buddha in the
<em>Sakkapañhasutta</em>, where thinking is said to be the cause of desire, and
reckonings born of prolific perception are said to be the cause of thinking.</p>
<p>But actually there is no contradiction, since the raw material for thinking is
the set of reckonings or worldly concepts born of prolific perception.
Proliferation only aggravates the situation by further ramification of concepts,
which overwhelm and obsess the person concerned.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a peculiar circularity involved in the process. Even
for thinking concepts evolved by prolific perception are utilized. In the course
of thinking proliferation takes over, with the result that those concepts throw
up a flush that tends to overwhelm and obsess the one who initiated the whole
process. As in the case of a fermenting agent, used in the preparation of
liquor, there is a circularity in this proliferation, which makes the confusion
in <em>saṁsāra</em> worst confounded.</p>
<p>Now in order to break this cycle, a systematic and gradual approach is needed.
That is what the <em>Sakkapañhasutta</em> lays down. Here is a task that cannot be done
slipshod. It is one that calls for mindfulness and circumspection.</p>
<p>The Buddha has described in minor detail the modus operandi from the rugged
outset proceeding by gradual stages towards subtler and subtler objectives. It
is a forked path, where one has to proceed always keeping to the right, choosing
the skilful in preference to the unskilful, and intuitive in preference to the
ratiocinative. So here we have a wonderfully graded path that combines
relativity with pragmatism.</p>
<p>If our discussion of the terms <em>vitakka, papañca</em> and <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em> has
already revealed their incompatibility with insight, there cannot be any
confusion on coming across canonical references to the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> as
<em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, ‘thoughtless concentration’. This term has puzzled many a
scholar.</p>
<p>We find, for instance, in the <em>Subhūtisutta</em> of the <em>Jaccandhavagga</em> of the
<em>Udāna</em> a reference to <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>. There it is said that the Venerable
Subhūti, an <em>arahant</em>, was sitting cross-legged in front of the Buddha with his
body erect, having attained to <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, and that the Buddha uttered
the following paean of joy on seeing him so seated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa vitakkā vidhūpitā</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattaṁ suvikappitā asesā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ saṅgam aticca arūpasaññī</em> <br />
<em>catuyogātigato na jātim eti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn949-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn949">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a verse with a very deep meaning, but before getting down to its meaning
as such, we cannot help making some observations about the commentarial
explanation of the term <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, ‘thoughtless concentration’.</p>
<p>According to the commentary, <em>avitakkasamādhi</em> stands for all levels of
concentration, both fine-material, <em>rūpāvacara</em> and immaterial, <em>arūpāvacara</em>,
from the second <em>jhāna</em> upwards. This is an interpretation purely from the
<em>samatha</em> or tranquillity standpoint. The commentary goes on to say that in the
present context it means <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, based on the fourth <em>jhāna</em>,
<em>idha pana catutthajhānapādako arahattaphalasamādhi avitakkasamādhi’ti
adhippeto</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn950-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn950">18</a></sup></p>
<p>But we have to point out that in the light of the foregoing observations on
<em>vitakka</em> and <em>papañca</em>, <em>avitakkasamādhi</em> is not a term that is relevant merely
to the <em>samatha</em> aspect of Buddhist meditation. It is not simply a term that
connotes all <em>jhānas</em> devoid of thought, <em>vitakka</em>. It is a term directly
relevant to insight, <em>vipassanā</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of <em>samatha</em> is to temporarily suppress thought,
<em>vikkhambhanappahāna</em>, abandonment by suppression. It is the task of insight to
dig into the roots of thinking and clear up the mess, making them ineffective.
In other words, it is of relevance to abandonment by eradication,
<em>samucchedappahāna</em>. It is in that sense that <em>avitakkasamādhi</em> stands for
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>But now in order to clarify this point further, let us get down to the meaning
of this difficult verse. It might be easier for comprehension if we explain the
four lines one by one.</p>
<p>The first line is <em>yassa vitakkā vidhūpitā</em>. There the commentary interprets
<em>vitakkā</em> as all wrong thoughts, such as those of sensuality. The word
<em>vidhūpitā</em> gets the following comment: <em>ariyamaggañāṇena santāpitā
susamucchinnā</em>, “burnt up by the knowledge of the noble path and fully
eradicated”.</p>
<p>However, we happened to mention in an earlier sermon that the word <em>vidhūpita</em>
has an extremely deep meaning. Particularly in a context where the two words
<em>sandhūpeti</em> and <em>vidhūpeti</em> were found together, we pointed out that the
<em>dhūpa</em> element in both words is suggestive of a peculiar ritual connected with
incense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn951-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn951">19</a></sup> Fragrant incense powder is used for the propitiation of gods,
while caustic types are used for exorcising evil spirits. So <em>vidhūpita</em> could
mean ‘smoking out’ or ‘expelling’ of thoughts in this context.</p>
<p>Now as regards the second line, <em>ajjhattaṁ suvikappitā asesā</em>, the commentary
takes <em>suvikappitā</em> as an equivalent of <em>susamucchinnā</em>, ‘fully eradicated’. But
it is more likely that the word <em>vikappita</em> basically signifies some form of
‘building up’, since it is derived from the root <em>kḷp,</em> “to make, build,
construct, fit out”, from which Sanskrit words like <em>vikalpa, saṁkalpa, ākalpa</em>
and <em>kalpanā</em> are derived.</p>
<p><em>Ajjhattaṁ suvikappitā</em> taken together would therefore mean “well constructed
within”. The second line could now be paraphrased as <em>yassa ajjhattaṁ
suvikappitā vitakkā asesā vidhūpitā</em>, “in whom thoughts, well constructed
within, have been smoked out without residue”.</p>
<p>Let us now try to unravel the meaning of the last two lines, <em>taṁ saṅgam aticca
arūpasaññī, catuyogātigato na jātim eti</em>. The commentary explains the word
<em>saṅgaṁ</em> as implying attachment to defilements such as lust, but the attachment
meant in this context is attachment to thoughts, <em>vitakka</em>. <em>Taṁ saṅgam aticca</em>
means having gone beyond the attachment to thoughts.</p>
<p>Then comes a term which is even more abstruse: <em>arūpasaññī</em>. The commentary
adopts a queer mode of exegesis here. It says: <em>ruppanasaṅkhātassa ca vikārassa
tattha abhāvato nibbikārahetubhāvato vā ’arūpan’ti laddhanāmaṁ nibbānaṁ
ārammaṇaṁ katvā</em>. “Nibbāna is called <em>arūpa</em> because it is devoid of change that
is reckoned as an affliction, <em>ruppana</em>, and <em>arūpasaññī</em> therefore means ‘one
who is percipient of Nibbāna as the goal of the path’.”</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the compound term <em>arūpasaññī</em> could be analyzed in two
ways. One can split it up as <em>arūpa + saññī</em>, or as <em>a + rūpasaññī</em>, <em>a</em>
signifying negation equivalent to <em>na</em>.</p>
<p>In the first case, it gives the meaning “percipient of the immaterial” realm. In
the second case, the meaning is “devoid of perception of form”. There is a
subtle difference between these two possible senses. The commentarial
interpretation prefers the first sense, trying to establish the term <em>arūpa</em> as
an epithet for Nibbāna rather arbitrarily. It is the second possible
interpretation that fits the context. <em>Arūpasaññī</em> means devoid of <em>rūpasaññā</em>,
<em>a + rūpasaññī</em>.</p>
<p>In one of our earlier sermons, we had occasion to mention that the perception of
form is a basic reason for thought activity, as it enables one to pick up signs.
By way of illustration, we alluded to the following verse in the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>ettha sā chijjate jaṭā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn952-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn952">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Where name and form <br />
As well as resistance and perception of form <br />
Are completely cut off, <br />
It is there that the tangle gets snapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is that same <em>rūpasaññā</em> that finds mention here too in this problematic
verse. <em>Arahattaphalasamādhi</em> is not an approach towards <em>arūpasaññā</em>, but a
release from <em>rūpasaññā</em> in toto. As we have already pointed out on an earlier
occasion, <em>arūpa</em> still has the seed of <em>rūpa</em> in it. <em>Arūpa</em> is only a shadow
of <em>rūpa</em> and presupposes it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reference in this verse is not to <em>arūpa</em>. <em>Arūpasaññī</em> has a
deeper meaning than that. It implies release from the perception of form,
<em>rūpasaññā</em>, which sustains the illusion of permanence and encourages the
grasping of signs. Perception of form and the idea of resistance, <em>paṭigha</em>,
that goes with it, is at the root of this <em>saṁsāric</em> problem. Now <em>arūpasaññī</em>
implies the absence of that <em>rūpasaññā</em> in the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>The third line, <em>taṁ saṅgam aticca arūpasaññī</em>, could therefore be rendered as
“having gone beyond attachment (to thoughts) and being free from the perception
of form”.</p>
<p>Now we are left with the last line of the verse: <em>catuyogātigato na jātim eti.</em>
<em>Catuyogā</em> means the four yokes, namely those of sensuality, existence, views
and ignorance, <em>kāma, bhava, diṭṭhi, avijjā</em>.</p>
<p><em>Catuyogātigato na jātim eti</em> conveys the idea that the Venerable Arahant
Subhūti, who has gone beyond the four yokes, comes not back to birth. So this
particular verse reveals to us a deeper dimension of the term <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>.</p>
<p>Coming back to the question of smoking out or exorcising thoughts, it seems
thoughts, or <em>vitakkā</em>, are comparable to the army of Māra. In this concern, the
important issue of thoughts, so relevant to the life of a meditator, finds an
interesting answer.</p>
<p>The army of Māra is, in the last analysis, our thoughts themselves. Generally we
take references to an army of Māra in its gross sense. But in some suttas, like
the <em>Padhānasutta</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, the army of Māra is defined in terms
of thoughts. For instance, one reads in the <em>Padhānasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kāmā te paṭhamā senā,</em> <br />
<em>dutiyā arati vuccati,</em> <br />
<em>tatiyā khuppipāsā te,</em> <br />
<em>catutthī taṇhā pavuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn953-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn953">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Sense desires are your first battalion, <br />
And boredom is reckoned the second, <br />
Hunger and thirst comes as the third, <br />
And craving is called the fourth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>kāmā</em> in this context does not refer to pleasurable objects as such,
though that is what is usually meant by it. Rather, it refers to thoughts about
pleasurable objects. In fact, <em>kāmā</em> in its real sense does imply thoughts about
pleasurable objects, as clearly stated in the following verse of the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na te kāmā yāni citrāni loke,</em> <br />
<em>saṅkapparāgo purisassa kāmo,</em> <br />
<em>tiṭṭhanti citrāni tatheva loke,</em> <br />
<em>athettha dhīrā vinayanti chandaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn954-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn954">22</a></sup></p>
<p>They are not the pleasures, those charming things in the world, <br />
Lustful thought is the pleasure for a man, <br />
They go on as before, those charming things in the world, <br />
But it is the desire for them, that the wise discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we already mentioned in our discussion of the <em>Sakkapañhasutta</em>, desire is
the cause of thinking. There, the relation between desire and thought is
recognized. It is the desire for pleasure that those who are prudently wise
discipline and dispel. All this goes to prove that the word <em>kāmā</em> primarily
refers, not to the objects of sense desire, but to thoughts about them. So, in
the last analysis, we are confronted with the question of thought.</p>
<p>For instance, hunger and thirst, <em>khuppipāsā</em>, are cited as another battalion of
Māra. Here, too, it is not hunger and thirst in themselves that represent the
army of Māra. It is thoughts about them, such as <em>kiṁ su asissāmi, kuvaṁ vā
asissaṁ</em>, “what shall I eat, where shall I eat”. For we read in the
<em>Sāriputtasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁ su asissāmi, kuvaṁ vā asissaṁ</em> <br />
<em>dukkhaṁ vata settha, kvajja sessaṁ</em> <br />
<em>ete vitakke paridevaneyye,</em> <br />
<em>vinayetha sekho aniketasārī.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn955-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn955">23</a></sup></p>
<p>What shall I eat, where shall I eat? <br />
Badly have I slept, where shall I sleep? <br />
Such miserable thoughts let the trainee discipline, <br />
As he wanders forth without an abode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against this background of the paramount importance attached to thoughts, we can
reassess the significance of the following verse in the <em>Bodhivagga</em> of the
<em>Udāna</em>, we had already quoted in a previous sermon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yadā have pātubhavanti dhammā,</em> <br />
<em>Ātāpino jhāyato brāhmaṇassa,</em> <br />
<em>Vidhūpayaṁ tiṭṭhati Mārasenaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>Suriyo ’va obhāsayam antalikkhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn956-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn956">24</a></sup></p>
<p>When phenomena manifest themselves, <br />
To the resolutely meditating Brahmin, <br />
He stands fumigating the hordes of Māra, <br />
Even as the sun irradiating the firmament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his enlightenment the Buddha spent the first week seated under the
Bodhi-tree and during the last watch of the night of the seventh day reflected
on the law of dependent arising both in the direct and reverse order. This
joyous utterance has an allusion to it. It is when the insight into conditioned
phenomena dawns on the contemplating <em>arahant</em> that he smokes out the hordes of
Māra, like the sun illuminating the sky.</p>
<p>In the light of this simile, we can now understand how the hordes of Māra are
dispelled. It is the reflection on the law of dependent arising in direct and
reverse order that dispels the denizens of darkness of ignorance, namely
thoughts.</p>
<p>The principle underlying the law of dependent arising is summed up in the
following abstract formula, which we had discussed at length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassuppādā idam uppajjati,</em> <br />
<em>imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati.</em></p>
<p>This being, this comes to be; <br />
With the arising of this, this arises. <br />
This not being, this does not come to be; <br />
With the cessation of this, this ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this principle is applied in a thorough-going way to conditioned phenomena,
they tend to fade away. That is how thoughts are dispelled. In the twelve-linked
formula each pair, for example <em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā</em>, is based on this
dynamic principle represented by the term <em>paccaya.</em> A penetrative reflection
into arising and ceasing in a flash deprives thoughts of their evocative power
and renders them nugatory. This is the smoking out of the army of Māra, the
thoughts.</p>
<p>Now to hark back to the <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, we come across an allusion to it in
the <em>Sāriputtatheragāthā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Avitakkaṁ samāpanno</em> <br />
<em>sammāsambuddhasāvako</em> <br />
<em>ariyena tuṇhībhāvena</em> <br />
<em>upeto hoti tāvade.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn957-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn957">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The Fully Awakened One’s disciple, <br />
On attaining to thoughtless musing, <br />
Is at once endowed with a silence <br />
That is of the ennobling type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, then, is none other than the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>,
which is known as <em>ariyo tuṇhībhāvo</em>, ‘noble silence’.</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with the second <em>jhāna</em>, in which thinking and
pondering have been calmed down by <em>samatha</em>, tranquillity meditation. Noble
silence in the highest sense is <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>, because in it the
question of thoughts is fully resolved. That, indeed, is the <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>.
We get another allusion to this thoughtless concentration in <em>Vimalātherīgāthā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nisinnā rukkhamūlamhi</em> <br />
<em>avitakkassa lābhinī.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn958-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn958">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Seated am I, at the root of a tree, <br />
A winner to the thoughtless state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a long verse in the <em>Dhītarosutta</em> of the <em>Mārasaṁyutta</em> in the
<em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, where again there is a reference to this thoughtless
concentration. To quote the relevant section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Passaddhakāyo suvimuttacitto</em> <br />
<em>asaṅkhārāno satimā anoko</em> <br />
<em>aññāya dhammaṁ avitakkajhāyī.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn959-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn959">27</a></sup></p>
<p>In body relaxed, in mind well freed, <br />
Concocting not, mindful, abode-less, <br />
Well knowing the Norm, he muses thoughtless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this points to the fact that the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> is called
<em>avitakkasamādhi</em> in a very special sense. It is relevant to insight meditation
and not to mere tranquillity meditation. The problem of thoughts could be fully
resolved only when the reckonings born of prolific perception are abandoned.</p>
<p>In the <em>Cūḷavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em> we get a reference to this aspect of the
<em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā attano papañcasaññāsaṅkhāpahānaṁ
paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn960-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn960">28</a></sup></p>
<p>At that time the Fortunate One was seated reflecting on his abandonment of
reckonings born of prolific perceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time the mind is free from worldly concepts born of prolific perception,
inwardly all thoughts are rendered powerless. Thoughts do not come up and there
is no grasping of signs. It is to highlight this fact that the terms
<em>avitakkajhāna</em> and <em>avitakkasamādhi</em> are used.</p>
<p>By way of further proof, we may cite the following two verses in the
<em>Saṁyojanasutta</em> of the <em>Sagāthakavagga</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. A deity poses
the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kiṁsu saṁyojano loko,</em> <br />
<em>kiṁsu tassa vicāraṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kissassa vippahānena</em> <br />
<em>nibbānam iti vuccati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn961-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn961">29</a></sup></p>
<p>What is the fetter of the world, <br />
What is its trailing along? <br />
By giving up what, do they say, <br />
Nibbāna is attained?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha gives the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nandī saṁyojano loko,</em> <br />
<em>vitakkassa vicāraṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>taṇhāya vippahānena</em> <br />
<em>nibbānam iti vuccati.</em></p>
<p>To delight enfettered is the world, <br />
Thought is its trailing along. <br />
It is that craving, by giving up which, <br />
They say, Nibbāna is attained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, again, we have an indication of the relevance of thoughts to the question
of insight. The <em>Sundarikabhāradvājasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> has the
following allusion to the qualities of an <em>arahant</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhavāsavā yassa vacī kharā ca</em> <br />
<em>vidhūpitā atthagatā na santi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn962-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn962">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In whom the influxes of existence, <br />
And the sediments of speech as well, <br />
Are smoked out, gone down, and exist no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary takes the word <em>vacī kharā</em> to mean ‘harsh speech’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn963-1"><a href="sermon-29.html#fn-fn963">31</a></sup> There
is some imbalance between the two terms <em>bhavāsavā</em> and <em>vacī kharā</em>, if the
commentarial interpretation is granted. Harsh speech could ill afford to get
coupled with influxes of existence to be cited as fundamental defilements
extinct in an <em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>It seems <em>vacī kharā</em> has a deeper significance than that. It probably means the
sediments or dregs (Sanskrit <em>kṣāra</em>) of speech, namely the worldly concepts and
designations which, as <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, reckonings born of prolific
perception, form the basis of all thoughts.</p>
<p>In the <em>arahant</em>, therefore, influxes of existence as well as sediments of
speech, are smoked out, gone down and made extinct. This, then, seems to be the
most plausible interpretation of the two lines in question, <em>bhavāsavā yassa
vacī kharā ca, vidhūpitā atthagatā na santi.</em></p>
<p>So we have garnered sufficient canonical evidence to conclude that the terms
<em>vitakka</em> and <em>papañca</em> are particularly relevant to the life of a meditator.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> has been called
<em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, shows that the conquest of thoughts is not of a temporary
type, as in the case of tranquillity meditation. On the other hand, it is a
transcendence of a more radical type, through an insight into the relative
validity of worldly concepts, their falsifying nature and the perception of
permanence underlying them.</p>
<p><em>Avitakkasamādhi</em> is a term used to denote that state of complete emancipation
of the mind by making all signs fade away, so that the whole world appears like
a blotched water-colour painting, thus freeing the mind from the perception of
diversity, without even resorting to a perception of unity.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the thirtieth sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our previous sermon we discussed the way of liberating the mind from the grip
of thoughts, which are comparable to the army of Māra by means of the gradual
and systematic mode of practice based on the twin principles of pragmatism and
relativity.</p>
<p>We also made an attempt to understand why the <em>arahattaphalasamādhi</em> of the
<em>arahant</em>, who arrives at the non-prolific state by gradually attenuating
cravings, conceits and views, comes to be called <em>avitakkasamādhi</em>, ‘thoughtless
concentration’.</p>
<p>This <em>avitakkasamādhi</em> is the ‘noble silence’ in its highest sense. It is not
the temporary subsidence of thinking and pondering as in tranquillity
meditation. It goes deeper in that it routs the hosts of Māra at their very
citadel, as it were, by penetrative wisdom.</p>
<p>The other day, with special reference to the <em>Sakkapañhasutta</em> in the <em>Dīgha
Nikāya</em>, we outlined in brief a path of practice gradually tending towards the
cessation of reckonings born of prolific perception. That discourse expounds a
happiness, an unhappiness and an equanimity to be pursued, and a happiness, an
unhappiness and an equanimity not to be pursued.</p>
<p>We get a clear enunciation of these two kinds of happiness, unhappiness and
equanimity in the <em>Saḷāyatanavibhaṅgasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. In that
discourse, the Buddha gives an exposition of thirty-six pathways of thought of
beings under the heading <em>chattiṁsa sattapadā</em>, literally “thirty-six steps of
beings”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn965-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn965">2</a></sup> They are listed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Cha gehasitāni somanassāni,</em> <br />
“six kinds of happiness based on the household life”</li>
<li><em>Cha nekkhammasitāni somanassāni,</em> <br />
“six kinds of happiness based on renunciation”</li>
<li><em>Cha gehasitāni domanassāni,</em> <br />
“six kinds of unhappiness based on the household life”</li>
<li><em>Cha nekkhammasitāni domanassāni,</em> <br />
“six kinds of unhappiness based on renunciation”</li>
<li><em>Cha gehasitā upekkhā,</em> <br />
“six kinds of equanimity based on the household life”</li>
<li><em>Cha nekkhammasitā upekkhā,</em> <br />
“six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation”</li>
</ol>
<p>The ‘six’ in each case refers to the six objects of sense, namely form, sound,
smell, taste, tangible and idea, <em>rūpa, sadda, gandha, rasa, phoṭṭhabba,
dhamma.</em> Now in order to acquaint ourselves with the six kinds of happiness
based on the household life, let us try to understand the definition of the
first kind, that is to say ‘form’, as the object of the eye.</p>

happiness based on the household life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The happiness based on renunciation is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpānaṁ tveva aniccataṁ viditvā vipariṇāmavirāganirodhaṁ: ’Pubbe c’eva rūpā
etarahi ca sabbe te rūpā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā’ti, evaṁ etaṁ

<p>When by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away and cessation of forms
one sees as it actually is with right wisdom that forms both formerly and now
are all impermanent, suffering and subject to change, happiness arises. Such
happiness as this is called happiness based on renunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the unhappiness based on the household life is explained in the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuviññeyyānaṁ rūpānaṁ iṭṭhānaṁ kantānaṁ manāpānaṁ manoramānaṁ
lokāmisapaṭisaṁyuttānaṁ appaṭilābhaṁ vā appaṭilabhato samanupassato pubbe vā
appaṭiladdhapubbaṁ atītaṁ niruddhaṁ vipariṇataṁ samanussarato uppajjati
domanassaṁ, yaṁ evarūpaṁ domanassaṁ, idaṁ vuccati gehasitaṁ domanassaṁ.</em></p>
<p>When one regards as a non-acquisition the non-acquisition of forms cognizable
by the eye that are desirable, charming, agreeable, delightful, connected with
worldly gains, or when one recalls what was formerly not acquired that has
passed, ceased and changed, unhappiness arises. Such unhappiness as this is
called unhappiness based on the household life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description of unhappiness based on renunciation has a special significance
to insight meditation. It runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpānaṁ tveva aniccataṁ viditvā vipariṇāmavirāganirodhaṁ: ’Pubbe c’eva rūpā
etarahi ca sabbe te rūpā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā’ti, evaṁ etaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ samappaññāya disvā anuttaresu vimokhesu pihaṁ upaṭṭhāpeti:
’kadā’ssu nām’ahaṁ tad āyatanaṁ upasampajja viharissāmi yad ariyā etarahi
āyatanaṁ upasampajja viharantī’ti, iti anuttaresu vimokhesu pihaṁ
uppaṭṭhāpayato uppajjati pihapaccayā domanassaṁ, yaṁ evarūpaṁ domanassaṁ, idaṁ
vuccati nekkhammasitaṁ domanassaṁ.</em></p>
<p>When by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away and cessation of forms
one sees as it actually is with right wisdom that forms both formerly and now
are all impermanent, suffering and subject to change, one arouses a longing
for the supreme deliverances thus: “When shall I enter upon and abide in that
sphere that the Noble Ones now enter upon and abide in?” In one who arouses
such a longing for the supreme deliverances unhappiness arises conditioned by
that longing. Such unhappiness as this is called unhappiness based on
renunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description of unhappiness based on renunciation brings up some important
terms worth discussing. <em>Anuttaresu vimokhesu</em> is a reference to the three
supreme deliverances known as <em>animitta</em>, the ‘signless’, <em>appaṇihita</em>, the
‘undirected’, and <em>suññata</em>, the ‘void’.</p>
<p>The reference to an <em>āyatana</em>, ‘sphere’, in this passage is particularly
noteworthy. The sphere that the Noble Ones enter on and abide in is none other
than the sphere alluded to in the famous sutta on Nibbāna in the <em>Udāna</em>,
beginning with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ, yattha n’eva paṭhavī na āpo</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn966-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn966">3</a></sup> etc.,</p>
<p>“Monks, there is that sphere in which there is neither earth nor water” etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have pointed out that it is a reference to the cessation of the six
sense-spheres as a realization.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn967-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn967">4</a></sup> So the sphere that the Noble Ones enter
on and abide in is the very cessation of the six sense-spheres.</p>
<p>In the same sutta passage in the <em>Udāna</em>, we came across the three terms
<em>appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ</em> and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>, the ‘unestablished’, the ‘non
continuing’ and the ‘objectless’, which we identified as allusions to the three
deliverances.</p>
<p>The word <em>pihā</em> (Sanskrit <em>spṛhā</em>, ‘longing’, ‘desire’), occurring in this
context, shows that there need not be any hesitation in using words implying
desire in connection with Nibbāna. It is true that such a desire or longing for
Nibbāna makes one unhappy. But that unhappiness is preferable to the unhappiness
based on the household life. That is why it is upgraded here as unhappiness
based on renunciation.</p>
<p>So far we have quoted instances of the six kinds of happiness based on the
household life, <em>cha gehasitāni somanassāni</em>; the six kinds of happiness based
on renunciation, <em>cha nekkhammasitāni somanassāni</em>; the six kinds of unhappiness
based on the household life, <em>cha gehasitāni domanassāni</em>; and the six kinds of
unhappiness based on renunciation, <em>cha nekkhammasitāni domanassāni</em>.</p>
<p>The ‘six’ in each case refers to the objects of the six senses. Now lets us take
up a paradigm to understand the six kinds of equanimity based on the household
life, <em>cha gehasitā upekkhā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā uppajjati upekkhā bālassa mūḷhassa puthujjanassa
anodhijinassa avipākajinassa anādīnavadassāvino assutavato puthujjanassa, yā
evarūpā upekkhā rūpaṁ sā nātivattati, tasmā sā ’upekkhā gehasitā’ti vuccati.</em></p>
<p>On seeing a form with the eye, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated
worldling, in an untaught worldling who has not conquered his limitations, who
has not conquered the results [of <em>kamma</em>], and who is not aware of danger,
such equanimity as this does not transcend form, that is why it is called
equanimity based on the household life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The equanimity of a worldling, untaught in the Dhamma, who has not conquered
limitations and defilements, and who has not conquered the results of <em>kamma</em>,
is incapable of transcending form. His equanimity is accompanied by ignorance.</p>
<p>Then comes the description of equanimity based on renunciation, <em>nekkhammasitā
upekkhā</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpānaṁ tveva aniccataṁ viditvā vipariṇāmavirāganirodhaṁ: ’Pubbe c’eva rūpā
etarahi ca sabbe te rūpā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā’ti, evaṁ etaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ samappaññāya passato uppajjati upekkhā, yā evarūpā upekkhā rūpaṁ
sā ativattati, tasmā sā ’upekkhā nekkhammasitā’ti vuccati.</em></p>
<p>When by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away and cessation of forms
one sees as it actually is with right wisdom that forms both formerly and now
are all impermanent, suffering and subject to change, equanimity arises. Such
equanimity as this transcends form, that is why it is called ‘equanimity based
on renunciation’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same kind of reflection on impermanence upon occasion gives rise to
happiness, unhappiness and equanimity, according to the attitude taken up.
Unlike the equanimity born of ignorance, this equanimity, born of right wisdom,
transcends form. That is why it is called equanimity based on renunciation.</p>
<p>The Buddha speaks about all the thirty-six objects of sense, out of which we
brought up, as a paradigm, the illustration given about the visual object, form.</p>
<p>These thirty-six are called the thirty-six pathways of beings, <em>chattiṁsa
sattapadā</em>, in the sense that they depict the thought patterns of beings. In
this discourse, the Buddha proclaims the basic maxim he employs in gradually
channelling the thought processes of beings towards Nibbāna along these
thirty-six pathways. The maxim is summed up in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tatra idaṁ nissāya idam pajahatha</em>,</p>
<p>therein, depending on this, abandon this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This maxim has some affinity to the <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> formula “this being,
this arises”. In fact, this is a practical application of the same formula. In
the context of the path of practice, the dependence on one thing is for the
purpose of abandoning another. There is an attitude of detachment in this course
of practice. Based on this maxim, the Buddha outlines the way in which he guides
one towards Nibbāna in four stages. The first stage in that gradual path towards
Nibbāna is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tatra, bhikkhave, yāni cha nekkhammasitāni somanassāni tāni nissāya tāni
āgamma, yāni cha gehasitāni somanassāni tāni pajahatha tāni samatikkamatha,
evam etesaṁ pahānaṁ hoti, evam etesaṁ samatikkamo hoti.</em></p>
<p>Therein, monks, by depending on and relying on the six kinds of happiness
based on renunciation, abandon and transcend the six kinds of happiness based
on the household life, that is how they are abandoned, that is how they are
transcended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, by depending on the six kinds of unhappiness based on
renunciation, the six kinds of unhappiness based on the household life are
abandoned. Also, by depending on the six kinds of equanimity based on
renunciation, the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life are
abandoned.</p>
<p>So at the end of the first stage, what are we left with? All what is based on
the household life is left behind, and only the six kinds of happiness based on
renunciation, the six kinds of unhappiness based on renunciation and the six
kinds of equanimity based on renunciation remain. That is the position at the
end of the first stage.</p>
<p>Then, in the second stage, a subtler and more refined level of experience is
aimed at. Out of the three types of mental states based on renunciation,
firstly, the six kinds of unhappiness based on renunciation are abandoned by the
six kinds of happiness based on renunciation. Then the six kinds of happiness
based on renunciation are abandoned by the six kinds of equanimity based on
renunciation.</p>
<p>To the extent that all the above three mental states are based on renunciation,
they are of a piece with each other. Also, it is the same mode of insightful
reflection that gives rise to them.</p>
<p>However, as attitudes, happiness is subtler and more excellent than unhappiness,
and equanimity is subtler and more excellent than happiness, since it is nearer
to wisdom. So in the second stage we see a gradual procedure arriving at a
subtler and more excellent state even in the case of those three mental states
based on renunciation. By the end of the second stage, only equanimity based on
renunciation remains.</p>
<p>Now comes the third stage. Here the Buddha points out that in the case of
equanimity there can be two varieties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi, bhikkhave, upekkhā nānattā nānattasitā, atthi, bhikkhave, upekkhā
ekattā ekattasitā.</em></p>
<p>There is, monks, an equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and
there is an equanimity that is unified, based on unity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is that equanimity that is diversified? It is defined as the equanimity
regarding the objects of the five external senses, that is to say, equanimity
regarding forms, sounds, smells, flavours and tangibles.</p>
<p>Equanimity that is unified is defined with reference to the immaterial realms,
namely the sphere of infinity of space, the sphere of infinity of consciousness,
the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
<p>Now in the case of these two types of equanimity, the Buddha points out a way of
abandoning the equanimity based on diversity with the help of the equanimity
based on unity. As equanimity both types are commendable, but that which is
diversified and based on diversity is grosser. Equanimity that is unified and
based on unity is subtler and more excellent. So the equanimity based on
diversity is abandoned and transcended by the equanimity that is unified, based
on unity. This is the end of the third stage.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, we are left with only that equanimity that is based on
unity. It is experienced in the higher rungs of meditation. But here, too, the
Buddha advocates a prudent course of action. In fact, it is here that the
deepest practical hint is given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atammayataṁ, bhikkhave, nissāya atammayataṁ āgamma, yāyam upekkhā ekattā
ekattasitā, taṁ pajahatha taṁ samatikkamatha, evam etissā pahānaṁ hoti, evam
etissā samatikkamo hoti.</em></p>
<p>Monks, by depending and relying on non-identification abandon and transcend
equanimity that is unified, based on unity; that is how it is abandoned, that
is how it is transcended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Atammayatā</em> is a term we have already discussed at length in our earlier
sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn968-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn968">5</a></sup> Its importance has not been sufficiently recognized in our
tradition. As we pointed out, the word <em>tammayo</em>, literally ‘of thatness’, could
be explained with reference to such usages as <em>suvaṇṇamaya</em> and <em>rajatamaya</em>,
‘golden’ and ‘silver’. How does this ‘of thatness’ come by?</p>
<p>If, for instance, one who has attained the infinity of space as a meditative
experience identifies himself with it, with the conceit <em>eso ’ham asmi</em>, ‘this
am I’, there is that <em>tammayatā</em> coming in. It is a subtle grasping, or in other
words a me-thinking, <em>maññanā</em> – imagining oneself to be one with that
experience. So the Buddha’s advice is to abandon and transcend even that
equanimity based on unity by resorting to the maxim of <em>atammayatā</em>,
non-identification.</p>
<p>The subtle conceit ‘am’, <em>asmi</em>, is that trace of grasping with which one tries
to sit pretty on that which is impermanent and changing. It is the most
fundamental assertion of existence.</p>
<p>In the <em>Sappurisasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> we get a good illustration of
the application of this principle of detachment, made known by the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati:</em></p>
<p><em>Nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā pi kho atammayatā vuttā Bhagavatā, ’yena yena
hi maññanti tato taṁ hoti aññathā’ti.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So atammayataṁ yeva antaraṁ karitvā tāya nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā
n’eva attān’ukkaṁseti na paraṁ vambheti. Ayam pi, bhikkhave,
sappurisadhammo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn969-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn969">6</a></sup></p>
<p>But a good man, monks, considers thus:</p>
<p>“Non-identification even with the attainment of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception has been declared by the Fortunate One
[in such terms as]: ‘In whatever way they imagine, thereby it turns
otherwise’.”</p>
<p>So he takes into account that very non-identification and neither exalts
himself nor disparages others because of his attainment of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This, too, monks, is the nature of a
good man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Sappurisasutta</em>, the Buddha expounds the characteristics of a ‘good
man’. In this context, the term <em>sappurisa</em>, ‘good man’, is used exclusively to
represent a noble disciple, <em>ariyasāvaka</em>. A noble disciple does not look upon
his <em>jhānic</em> attainments in the same way as an ordinary meditator attaining
<em>jhānas</em>. His point of view is different.</p>
<p>This discourse explains his view point. A good man reflects wisely according to
the advice given by the Buddha to the effect that even to the higher <em>jhānic</em>
attainment of neither-perception-nor-non-perception the principle of
non-identification must be applied, recalling the maxim made known by the
Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti tato taṁ hoti aññatha</em>,</p>
<p>in whatever way they imagine, thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a maxim we had discussed earlier too.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn970-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn970">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Maññanā</em> is egoistic imagining. When one thinks in egoistic terms about
something, by that very me-thinking it turns otherwise. Due to egoistic
imagining, it becomes a thing, and once it becomes a thing, it is bound to
change and become another.</p>
<p>The good man calls to mind that maxim, that norm, and refrains from exalting
himself and disparaging others on account of his attainment. He does not
identify himself with it. From this it becomes clear that <em>atammayatā</em> or
<strong>non-identification is the path to Nibbāna</strong>.</p>
<p>So the Buddha gradually channelizes the pathways of thoughts of beings from the
grosser to subtler levels and finally tops up by directing them to Nibbāna
through non-identification, <em>atammayatā</em>. Non-identification is the watchword
for clinging-free <em>parinibbāna</em>.</p>
<p>The dictum <em>tatra idaṁ nissāya idam pajahatha</em>, “therein, depending on this,
abandon this”, which the Buddha expounds in the <em>Saḷāyatanavibhaṅgasutta</em>,
portrays a duality between attention, <em>manasikāra</em>, and inattention,
<em>amanasikāra</em>.</p>
<p>That is to say, the basic principle in this dictum is the method of encouraging
inattention to grosser things by recommending a way of attending to subtler
things. So it seems both attention and inattention are given an importance in
this procedure.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate one thing by inattention, attention to some other thing is
recommended. For the purpose of inattention to something gross, attention to
something subtle is taken up. But that is not the end of it. Even that is
expelled with the help of something subtler. Here we have a wonderful technique,
based on the twin principles of pragmatism and relativity.</p>
<p>These two terms comprehend the entire gamut of the path of practice in Buddhism.
‘Pragmatic’ means ‘for some practical purpose’, ‘relative’ means ‘in relation to
something else’, that is, as a means to an end, and not absolutely as an end in
itself. So in this system of practice everything has a pragmatic and a relative
value.</p>
<p>The question of attention and inattention has also to be understood in that
background. A clear illustration of the method of elimination of grosser mental
states with the help of subtler mental states by attention and inattention comes
in the <em>Vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. There the Buddha
explains this method making use of a simile of a carpenter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathā pi, bhikkhave, dakkho palagaṇḍo vā palagaṇḍantevāsī vā sukhumāya
āṇiyā oḷārikaṁ āṇiṁ abhinīhaneyya abhinīhareyya abhinivajjeyya, evam eva kho,
bhikkhave, bhikkhuno yaṁ nimittam āgamma yaṁ nimittaṁ manasikaroto uppajjanti
pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṁhitā pi dosūpasaṁhitā pi mohūpasaṁhitā pi,
tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṁ nimittaṁ manasikātabbaṁ
kusalūpasaṁhitaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn971-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn971">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as, monks, a skilled carpenter or his apprentice might knock out, draw
out and remove a coarse peg by means of a fine one, even so, monks, when a
monk [finds that], due to some sign, by attending to some sign, there arise in
him evil unskilful thoughts connected with desire, with hate and with
delusion, that monk, monks, should attend to some other sign in its stead, one
that has to do with the skilful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let us try to understand the point of this simile. When, for instance, a
carpenter, in fitting out a door, finds that he is driving a blunt nail, he
extracts it with the help of a sharper one. He takes up the sharper nail just
for the purpose of extracting the blunt nail. So also one resorts to a skilful
thought to expel the unskilful thought as a means to an end. This kind of
pragmatic and relative approach avoids tenacious grasping and dogmatic
involvement.</p>
<p>The spirit of the law of dependent arising runs through the entire course of
Buddhist practice, culminating in <em>atammayatā</em>, non-identification.</p>
<p>The two terms <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> also deserve our special attention in this
context. The basic meaning of <em>kusala</em> is ‘skilful’, and <em>akusala</em> means
‘unskilful’.</p>
<p>Here, again, we have something relative. ‘Skilful’ presupposes ‘unskilful’ and
gets a value in relation to the latter. It has no absolute value. We make use of
the skilful in order to push away the unskilful. That done, there is no further
involvement with it, as one’s last resort is <em>atammayatā</em>, non-identification.
That is why there is no problem of a clogging coming in.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the <em>Saḷāyatanavibhaṅgasutta</em> brings to light another unique
feature of this Dhamma. In other religious systems the question of reality is
resolved by having recourse to unity. Oneness is supposed to be the ultimate
goal.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the <em>saṁsāric</em> problem, we often referred to a duality or a
dichotomy. Everywhere we were confronted with a duality. But to grasp the two as
one, in some form of oneness, is not the way out. Instead we have here, as the
final solution, <em>atammayatā</em> or non-identification, a clinging-free approach in
the last analysis.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of <em>saṁsāric</em> existence that beings find themselves bound
and fettered. These fetters are called <em>saṁyojanāni</em>. A binding or a fetter
implies ‘two’, as when two bulls are tied together.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn972-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn972">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <em>upādāna</em> is also used quite often. It implies a holding on to
something. There, too, the notion of a duality comes in – one who holds and the
thing held. It is not at all easy to transcend this duality, characteristic of
<em>saṁsāric</em> existence. This is the crux of the whole problem. Unity or oneness is
not the solution, it has to be solved with extreme judiciousness.</p>
<p>In the very first discourse of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> we get a solution to the
problem, briefly stated. The discourse is called <em>Oghataraṇasutta</em>, “Crossing
the Flood”, and it was given pride of place probably because of its importance.</p>
<p>A deity comes and asks the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁ nu tvaṁ mārisa ogham atari?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn973-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn973">10</a></sup></p>
<p>How did you, Sir, cross the flood?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Appatiṭṭhaṁ khvāham, āvuso, anāyūhaṁ ogham atariṁ.</em></p>
<p>Without tarrying, friend, and without hurrying, did I cross the flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the deity, finding the answer too enigmatic, asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā kathaṁ pana tvaṁ mārisa appatiṭṭham anāyūham ogham atari?</em></p>
<p>But how [exactly is it], sir, that you crossed the flood without tarrying and
without hurrying?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha makes an explanatory statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yadā svāham, āvuso, santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṁsīdāmi, yadā svāham āvuso āyūhāmi
tadāssu nibbuyhāmi. Evam khvāham, āvuso, appatiṭṭhaṁ anāyūhaṁ ogham atariṁ.</em></p>
<p>When I, friend, tarried, I found myself sinking; when I, friend, hurried, I
got swept away. And so, friend, without tarrying and without hurrying did I
cross the flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the deity, being pleased, uttered the following verse in approbation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cirassaṁ vata passāmi,</em> <br />
<em>brāhmaṇaṁ parinibbutaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>appatiṭṭhaṁ anāyūhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tiṇṇaṁ loke visattikaṁ.</em></p>
<p>O, what length of time since I beheld, <br />
A saint with all his passions quelled, <br />
Who neither tarrying nor yet hurrying, <br />
Has crossed the world’s viscosity – ‘craving’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discourse on crossing the flood reveals some salient features of the middle
path. If a person caught up in a water current tries to stay still, he will
sink. If he simply struggles to escape, he will get swept away. So like a good
swimmer, he has to avoid both extremes, and, by means of a mindful and
systematic gradual effort, work out his freedom. In other words, he has to
strive – not struggle.</p>
<p>So we can understand why the Buddha in his very first sermon,
<em>Dhammacakkapavattanasutta</em>, “Discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma”,
proclaimed as the middle path the noble eightfold path, avoiding both extremes
of attachment to sensuality, <em>kāmasukhallikānuyoga</em>, and self-mortification,
<em>attakilamathānuyoga</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn974-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn974">11</a></sup> Here, too, the implication is that the entire
round of existence is a water current to be crossed over by means of a
systematic and gradual effort.</p>
<p>In some of our earlier sermons, while analyzing the law of dependent arising, we
made use of the simile of the vortex for easy comprehension.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn975-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn975">12</a></sup> Now if we
are to take it up again, we may say that it is in the nature of beings in
<em>saṁsāra</em> to get drifted by the current of preparations, <em>saṇkhārā</em>, owing to
ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, and go on revolving between consciousness, <em>viññāṇa</em>, and
name-and-form, <em>nāma-rūpa</em>.</p>
<p>This ignorance in the form of the four pervert perceptions – namely the
perception of permanence in the impermanent, the perception of pleasure in the
painful, the perception of beauty in the repulsive, and the perception of self
in the not-self – gives rise to the run-away current of water which keeps
running round and round between consciousness and name-and-form. This is the
<em>saṁsāric</em> vortex, <em>saṁsāravaṭṭa</em>.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, if we throw even a small leaf to a spot where there is a
vortex, it also keeps revolving. Similarly, all over this <em>saṁsāric</em> existence
duality holds sway. Therefore, freedom from it can be won only by a subtle form
of striving. That is why the Buddha used the two terms <em>appatiṭṭhaṁ</em> and
<em>anāyūhaṁ</em>. Avoiding the two extremes of stagnation and struggling, one has to
cross the flood going the middle way.</p>
<p>When the Buddha proclaimed that freedom can be won only by the middle way,
avoiding both extremes, the extremist philosophers of his day criticized and
disparaged him, saying: “Then you are preaching a doctrine of bewilderment”.</p>
<p>We find such an instance of accusation in the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> of the <em>Aṭṭhaka
Vagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. The Brāhmin Māgandiya poses the following question
to the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Ajjhattasantī’ti yam etam atthaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>kathan nu dhīrehi paveditaṁ taṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn976-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn976">13</a></sup></p>
<p>That which they call ‘inward peace’, <br />
In what terms have the wise proclaimed that [peace]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s answer took the following form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na diṭṭhiyā na sutiyā na ñāṇena,</em> <br />
<em>sīlabbatenāpi visuddhim āhu,</em> <br />
<em>adiṭṭhiyā assutiyā aññāṇā</em> <br />
<em>asīlatā abbatā no pi tena,</em> <br />
<em>ete ca nissajja anuggahāya</em> <br />
<em>santo anissāya bhavaṁ na jappe.</em></p>
<p>Not by views, nor by learning, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor by knowledge, <br />
Nor yet by virtue and holy vows, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> they say, can purity come, <br />
Neither can it come by without views, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> learning and knowledge, <br />
Without virtue and holy vows, <br />
Letting go of them all and grasping not one, <br />
That peaceful one, leaning on none, <br />
Would hanker no more for existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this reply the Brāhmin Māgandiya was puzzled and accuses the Buddha of
prevarication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No ce kira diṭṭhiyā na sutiyā na ñāṇena,</em> <br />
<em>sīlabbatenāpi visuddhim āha,</em> <br />
<em>adiṭṭhiyā assutiyā aññāṇā</em> <br />
<em>asīlatā abbatā no pi tena,</em> <br />
<em>maññe-m-ahaṁ momuham eva dhammaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>diṭṭhiyā eke paccenti suddhiṁ.</em></p>
<p>If not by views, nor by learning, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor by knowledge, <br />
Nor yet by virtue and holy vows <br />
<span class="vin"></span> can purity be won, <br />
If it comes not without views, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> learning and knowledge, <br />
Without virtue and holy vows – well then <br />
Bewilderment itself, I think, is this Dhamma, <br />
For there are some who claim purity by views.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now these two verses call for some comments. Firstly there is a minor problem
about variant readings. In both these verses, we followed the reading
<em>visuddhi</em>, whereas some editions accept the reading <em>na suddhim āha</em>, where the
negative seems superfluous. <em>Visuddhi</em> seems more meaningful here.</p>
<p>The commentarial explanation of these two verses seems to go off at a
tangent.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn977-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn977">14</a></sup> It says that the negatives in the first two lines of the
Buddha’s reply refer to wrong views, wrong learning, wrong knowledge, wrong
virtue and wrong vows, and that the third and fourth lines refer to right view,
right learning, right knowledge, right virtue and right vows. In other words, it
is only a question of wrong view, <em>micchā diṭṭhi</em>, and right view, <em>sammā
diṭṭhi</em>.</p>
<p>This interpretation misses the subtle point at issue in this dialogue. If it is
as simple as that, there is no ground for Māgandiya’s accusation. Other
religious teachers, who disputed with each other, used to assert that purity is
attained only by their views, learning, knowledge, virtue and vows.</p>
<p>Here then it is not a question of difference between <em>micchā diṭṭhi</em> and <em>sammā
diṭṭhi</em>. Here is something more radical concerning <em>sammā diṭṭhi</em> itself.</p>
<p>According to this enlightened approach, views etc. cannot totally be dispensed
with, nor are they to be grasped. We come back now to the two key words
‘pragmatic’ and ‘relative’. That is why the Buddha declared that purity cannot
be attained by views, learning, knowledge, virtue and vows, nor in the absence
of these qualities.</p>
<p>This is an apparently contradictory statement which, however, puts in a nutshell
the essence of the middle path. The inward peace, mentioned in the above
context, is nothing other than the clinging-free perfect extinction, <em>anupādā
parinibbāna</em>. That becomes clear by the last three lines of the Buddha’s reply,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ete ca nissajja anuggahāya</em> <br />
<em>santo anissāya bhavaṁ na jappe.</em></p>
<p>Letting go of them all and grasping not one, <br />
That peaceful one, leaning on none, <br />
Would hanker no more for existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We came across the word <em>anissita</em> in our discussions about Nibbāna, for
instance in the cryptic formula</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nissitassa calitaṁ, anissitassa calitaṁ natthi</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn978-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn978">15</a></sup></p>
<p>to the one attached there is wavering, to the unattached one, there is no
wavering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being unattached, there is no hankering for existence. Where there is grasping,
there is existence.</p>
<p>We may revert to our simile of sharpening a razor.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn979-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn979">16</a></sup> The constituents of
the path have to be taken up as one takes up a razor for sharpening, ready to
let go. Once the purpose is served, they have to be given up. That is the dictum
underlying this dialogue in the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Now we come to a discourse which clearly and unmistakeably presents this
extraordinary first principle. The discourse is the <em>Rathavinītasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is not a case of arguing with a Brāhmin. The interlocutors in this
discourse are two stalwarts of this dispensation, namely Venerable Sāriputta and
Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta. Their long discussion on the path of practice,
unfolding itself in dialogue form, was not meant for any clarification of doubts
for themselves. It was probably inspired by a benevolent wish to help those
‘Māgandiyas’ in the world, who are ignorant of the pragmatic nature and relative
value of the Buddha’s middle path. For easy comprehension, we shall present this
discourse in three parts.</p>
<p>First of all Venerable Sāriputta poses the following question to Venerable Puṇṇa
Mantāṇiputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kin nu kho, āvuso, sīlavisuddhatthaṁ Bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussatī’ti?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn980-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn980">17</a></sup></p>
<p>“What, friend, is it for the sake of purification of virtue that the holy life
is lived under the Fortunate One?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification of mind that the holy life is lived
under the Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification of view that the holy life is lived
under the Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification by overcoming doubt that the holy
life is lived under the Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of what is
the path and what is not the path that the holy life is lived under the
Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way
that the holy life is lived under the Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
<p>“Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision that the holy
life is lived under the Fortunate One?” <br />
“No friend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Venerable Sāriputta asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then for the sake of what, friend, is the holy life lived under the
Fortunate One?”</p>
<p>“Friend it is for the sake of perfect Nibbāna without clinging that the holy
life is lived under the Fortunate One.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the ensemble of part one of the dialogue is that the holy life is not lived
under the Fortunate One for the sake of any of those purifications, but for
something called <em>anupādā parinibbāna</em>, “perfect Nibbāna without clinging”.</p>
<p>Now, in what we would call part two of the dialogue, Venerable Sāriputta
highlights the contradictions in the answers given so far, somewhat like
Māgandiya. Apparently there is some need for clarification. He asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But, friend, is purification of virtue perfect Nibbāna without clinging?” <br />
“No friend”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way he asks whether any of the other stages of purification, up to and
including purification by knowledge and vision, is perfect Nibbāna without
clinging. Venerable Puṇṇa answers in the negative. Then Venerable Sāriputta
asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kim pan’ āvuso aññatra imehi dhammehi anupādā parinibbānaṁ?</em></p>
<p>“But, friend, is perfect Nibbāna without clinging [to be attained] without
these states?” <br />
“No friend”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, it looks as if the trend of contradictions has come to a head.</p>
<p>Now in part three of the dialogue we find Venerable Sāriputta rhetorically
summing up the previous section of the dialogue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When asked: ‘But, friend, is purification of virtue perfect Nibbāna without
clinging?’, you replied: ‘No friend’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(and so on), citing even the last negative response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And when asked: ‘But, friend, is perfect Nibbāna without clinging [to be
attained] without these states?’, you replied: ‘No friend’”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and rounds up by asking with apparent exasperation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yathākathaṁ pan’ āvuso imassa bhāsitassa attho daṭṭhabbo?</em></p>
<p>“How, then, friend, can one understand the meaning of this statement?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So rather dramatically the stage is now set for Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta to
come out with the deepest point in the discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sīlavisuddhiñce āvuso Bhagavā anupādā parinibbānaṁ paññāpessa, sa-upādānaṁ
yeva samānaṁ anupādā parinibbānaṁ paññāpessa.</em></p>
<p>“Friend, if the Fortunate One had designated purification of virtue as perfect
Nibbāna without clinging, he would have designated what is still accompanied
by clinging as perfect Nibbāna without clinging.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same strain, he goes on to apply this criterion to the other stages of
purification and finally brings out the absurdity of the other extreme in the
following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aññatra ce, āvuso, imehi dhammehi anupādā parinibbānaṁ abhavissa, puthujjano
parinibbāyeyya, puthujjano hi, āvuso, aññatra imehi dhammehi.</em></p>
<p>“And if, friend, perfect Nibbāna without clinging were to be attained without
these states, then even an ordinary worldling would have attained perfect
Nibbāna without clinging, for an ordinary worldling, friend, is without these
states.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can see how subtle this question is. Simply because it was said that none
of the above states is perfect Nibbāna without clinging, they cannot be
dispensed with.</p>
<p>We have already discussed the significance of the <em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em> in this
concern. There we came across two similes, the simile of the raft and the simile
of the water snake. To carry the raft on one’s shoulder after crossing is one
extreme.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn981-1"><a href="sermon-30.html#fn-fn981">18</a></sup> To take the water snake by its tail is the other extreme. The
middle path lies between these two extremes. That is the implication of the
above statement that if perfect Nibbāna without clinging is attained without
these states, then even an ordinary worldling would have attained it, for he has
none of them.</p>
<p>For further clarification of this point, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta comes out
with the simile of the relay of chariots. King Pasendi of Kosala, while living
in Sāvatthī, has some urgent business to settle at Sāketa. Between Sāvatthī and
Sāketa seven relay chariots are kept ready for him. The king mounts the first
relay chariot and by means of it arrives at the second relay chariot. Then he
dismounts from the first relay chariot and mounts the second chariot. By means
of the second chariot he arrives at the third chariot. In this way, finally he
arrives at Sāketa by means of the seventh chariot.</p>
<p>Then, when his friends and relatives in Sāketa ask him: “Sire, did you come from
Sāvatthī to Sāketa by means of this chariot?”, he cannot reply in the
affirmative. He has to relate the whole story of passing from chariot to
chariot.</p>
<p>Having given this simile as an illustration, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta sums
up the correct solution to the point at issue in the following memorable words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evameva kho, āvuso, sīlavisuddhi yāvadeva cittavisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>cittavisuddhi yāvadeva diṭṭhivisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>diṭṭhivisuddhi yāvadeva kaṅkhāvitaraṇavisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>kaṅkhāvitaraṇavisuddhi yāvadeva maggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>maggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhi yāvadeva paṭipadañāṇadassanavisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>paṭipadañāṇadassanavisuddhi yāvadeva ñāṇadassanavisuddhatthā,</em></p>
<p><em>ñāṇadassanavisuddhi yāvadeva anupādā parinibbānatthā.</em></p>
<p><em>Anupādā parinibbānatthaṁ kho, āvuso, Bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati.</em></p>
<p>Even so, friend, purification of virtue is purposeful as far as purification
of the mind;</p>
<p>purification of the mind is purposeful as far as purification of view;</p>
<p>purification of view is purposeful as far as purification by overcoming doubt;</p>
<p>purification by overcoming doubt is purposeful as far as purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path;</p>
<p>purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the
path is purposeful as far as purification by knowledge and vision of the way;</p>
<p>purification by knowledge and vision of the way is purposeful as far as
purification by knowledge and vision;</p>
<p>purification by knowledge and vision is purposeful as far as perfect Nibbāna
without clinging.</p>
<p>It is for perfect Nibbāna without clinging that the holy life is lived under
the Fortunate One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word in this grand finale of this dramatic exposition is <em>yāvadeva</em>.
Simply rendered it means ‘just for’, that is, the sufficing condition for
something else.</p>
<p>Properly understood, it is a watchword upholding the twin principles of
pragmatism and relativity. In the light of the illustration by relay chariots,
this watchword stands for that impersonal momentum or impetus required for any
gradual course of purposive action, according to the law of dependent arising.</p>
<p>So we see how the Buddha discovered and laid bare the first principles of a
universal law conducive to one’s emancipation. Here is a series of states, in
which one state is to be made use of for reaching another, and that for reaching
yet another, but none of which is to be grasped per se. This is the distinction
between what is called <em>upadhi</em>, or <em>saṁsāric</em> asset, and <em>nirupadhi</em>, or the
asset-less Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the case of those meritorious deeds, productive of <em>saṁsāric</em> assets, one
goes on accumulating and amassing them. But, for the <em>nibbānic</em> state of
<em>nirupadhi</em>, the asset-less, there is a different approach.</p>
<p>One state leads up to another, and that to yet another, in accordance with the
simile of the relay chariots, but none of them is to be grasped per se. One
grasps neither purification of virtue, nor purification of the mind, nor
purification of view, nay, not even purification by knowledge and vision.
Leaving them all behind and reaching the subtlest of them all, there comes the
final ‘let go’ to attain that perfect extinction without clinging, <em>anupādā
parinibbāna</em>. This is the subtlest truth in this Dhamma.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the thirty-first sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our attempt to understand some subtle characteristics of the middle path
leading to Nibbāna in our last sermon, we found some discourses like
<em>Saḷāyatanavibhangasutta, Oghataraṇasutta, Vitakkasanthānasutta, Māgandiyasutta,
Rathavinītasutta</em> and <em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em> particularly helpful. It became clear
that the twin principle of pragmatism and relativity, underlying the norm of
dependent arising, could be gleaned to a great extent from those discourses.</p>
<p>We also found that the course of practice leading to Nibbāna is not an
accumulation or amassing, but a gradual process of attenuation or effacement,
tending towards a realization of voidness, free from notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.</p>
<p>It is for the purpose of emphasizing the twin principles of pragmatism and
relativity that the Buddha compared the Dhamma to a raft in the
<em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. In this series of sermons we made
allusions to this simile in brief on several occasions, but let us now try to
examine this simile in more detail. In order to present the parable of the raft,
the Buddha addressed the monks and made the following declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kullūpamaṁ vo, bhikkhave, dhammaṁ desissāmi nittharaṇatthāya no
gahaṇatthāya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn983-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn983">2</a></sup></p>
<p>“Monks, I shall preach to you the Dhamma comparable to a raft for crossing over
and not for grasping.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this introductory declaration, he goes on to relate the parable of the
raft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Monks, suppose a man in the course of a long journey, saw a great expanse of
water whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was
safe and free from fear. But there was no ferry boat or bridge going to the
far shore. Then he thought:</p>
<p>‘There is this great expanse of water whose near shore is dangerous and
fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear. But there is no
ferry boat or bridge going to the far shore. Suppose I collect grass, sticks,
branches and leaves and bind them together into a raft, and supported by the
raft and making an effort with my hands and feet I were to get safely across
to the far shore.’</p>
<p>And then the man collected grass, sticks, branches and leaves and bound them
together into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with his
hands and feet he got safely across to the far shore. Then, when he got safely
across and had arrived at the far shore he might think thus:</p>
<p>‘This raft has been very helpful to me, supported by it and making an effort
with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to
hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder and then go wherever I want.’</p>
<p>Now, monks, what do you think, by doing so would that man be doing what should
be done with that raft?“</p>
<p>“No, Venerable Sir.”</p>
<p>“By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raft?
Here, monks, when that man got across and had arrived at the far shore, he
might think thus:</p>
<p>‘This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an
effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I
were to haul it on dry land or set it adrift in the water and then go wherever
I want.’</p>
<p>Now it is by so doing that that man would be doing what should be done with
the raft. Even so, monks, I have shown you how the Dhamma is similar to a
raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of
grasping.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha concludes with the significant statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kullūpamaṁ vo, bhikkhave, ājānantehi dhammā pi vo pahātabbā, pageva adhammā.</em></p>
<p>“Monks, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft, you should abandon
even good states, how much more so bad states.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems, this raft simile has a very deep meaning. The building of the raft
by the person wishing to cross symbolizes the pragmatic and relative values we
highlighted in connection with the path of practice leading to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The raft improvised with self effort is not for grasping or carrying on one’s
shoulder. As we have already pointed out with reference to such discourses like
<em>Saḷāyatanavibhaṅgasutta</em>, apart from the purpose of crossing, there is nothing
worth holding on to or grasping. Why so? Because the aim of this holy life or
this path of practice is non-grasping instead of grasping; non-identification,
<em>atammayatā</em>, instead of identification, <em>tammayatā</em>; assetlessness,
<em>nirupadhi</em>, instead of assets, <em>upadhi</em>.</p>
<p>The importance attached to this simile is so much that the Buddha reminds the
monks of it in the <em>Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em> also, with the following allusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imaṁ ce tumhe, bhikkhave, diṭṭhiṁ evaṁ parisuddhaṁ evaṁ pariyodātaṁ allīyetha
kelāyetha dhanāyetha mamāyetha, api nu tumhe, bhikkhave, kullūpamaṁ dhammaṁ
desitaṁ ājāneyyatha nittharaṇatthāya no gahaṇatthāya?</em></p>
<p><em>No h’etaṁ, bhante!</em></p>
<p><em>Imaṁ ce tumhe, bhikkhave, diṭṭhiṁ evaṁ parisuddhaṁ evaṁ pariyodātaṁ na
allīyetha na kelāyetha na dhanāyetha na mamāyetha, api nu tumhe, bhikkhave,
kullūpamaṁ dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājāneyyatha nittharaṇatthāya no gahaṇatthāya?</em></p>
<p><em>Evaṁ, bhante.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn984-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn984">3</a></sup></p>
<p>“Monks, purified and cleansed as this view is, if you adhere to it, cherish
it, treasure it and treat it as a possession, would you then understand the
Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft being for the purpose of
crossing over and not for the purpose of grasping?”</p>
<p>“No, Venerable Sir!”</p>
<p>“Monks, purified and cleansed as this view is, if you do not adhere to it,
cherish it, treasure it and treat it as a possession, would you then
understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft being for the
purpose of crossing over and not for the purpose of grasping?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Venerable Sir!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an illustration of the relative validity of the constituents of the
path. Instead of an accumulation and an amassing, we have here a setting in
motion of a sequence of psychological states mutually interconnected according
to the law of relativity. As in the simile of the relay of chariots, what we
have here is a progression by relative dependence.</p>
<p>In this sequential progression, we see an illustration of the quality of leading
onward, <em>opanayika</em>, characteristic of this Dhamma.</p>
<p>The term <em>opanayika</em> has been variously interpreted, but we get a clue to its
correct meaning in the <em>Udāyisutta</em> of the <em>Bojjhaṅgasaṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>. Venerable Udāyi declares his attainment of the supramundane path in
these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dhammo ca me, bhante, abhisamito, maggo ca me paṭiladdho, yo me bhāvito
bahulīkato tathā tathā viharantaṁ tathattāya upanessati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn985-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn985">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Dhamma has been well understood by me, Venerable Sir, and that path has
been obtained which, when developed and cultivated, will lead me onwards to
such states as I go on dwelling in the appropriate way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is that the Dhamma has the intrinsic quality of leading onward
whoever is dwelling according to it so that he attains states of distinction
independent of another’s intervention.</p>
<p>A clearer illustration of this intrinsic quality can be found in the
<em>Cetanākaraṇīyasutta</em> among the Tens of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>. In that
discourse, the Buddha describes how a long sequence of mental states is
interconnected in a subtle way, according to the principle of relativity,
leading onwards as far as final deliverance itself. The following section of
that long discourse might suffice as an illustration of the mutual
interconnection between the mental states in the list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa na cetanāya karaṇīyaṁ ’avippaṭisāro me
uppajjatū’ti; dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṁ sīlavato sīlasampannassa
avippaṭisāro uppajjati.</em></p>
<p><em>Avippaṭisārissa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṁ ’pāmojjaṁ me uppajjatū’ti;
dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṁ avippaṭisārissa pāmojjaṁ jāyati.</em></p>
<p><em>Pamuditassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṁ ’pīti me uppajjatū’ti; dhammatā
esā, bhikkhave, yaṁ pamuditassa pīti uppajjati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn986-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn986">5</a></sup></p>
<p>To one who is virtuous, monks, who is endowed with virtue, there is no need
for an act of will like: “let remorselessness arise in me”; it is in the
nature of Dhamma, monks, that remorselessness arises in one who is virtuous,
who is endowed with virtue.</p>
<p>To one who is free from remorse, monks, there is no need for an act of will
like: “let gladness arise in me”; it is in the nature of Dhamma, monks, that
gladness arises in one who is free from remorse.</p>
<p>To one who is glad, monks, there is no need for an act of will like: “let joy
arise in me”; it is in the nature of Dhamma, monks, that joy arises in one who
is glad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, the Buddha outlines the entire course of training leading up to
knowledge and vision of deliverance, interlacing a long line of mental states in
such a way as to seem an almost effortless flow. The profound utterance, with
which the Buddha sums up this discourse, is itself a tribute to the quality of
leading onward, <em>opanayika</em>, in this Dhamma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammā va dhamme abhisandenti, dhammā va dhamme
paripūrenti apārā pāraṁ gamanāya.</em></p>
<p>Thus, monks, mere phenomena flow into other phenomena, mere phenomena fulfil
other phenomena in the process of going from the not beyond to the beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, in the last analysis, it is only a question of phenomena. There is no
‘I’ or ‘mine’ involved. That push, that impetus leading to Nibbāna, it seems, is
found ingrained in the Dhamma itself.</p>
<p>Not only the term <em>opanayika</em>, all the six terms used to qualify the Dhamma are
highly significant. They are also interconnected in meaning. That is why very
often in explaining one term others are dragged in.</p>
<p>Sometimes the questioner is concerned only about the meaning of the term
<em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, but the Buddha presents to him all the six qualities of the
Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn987-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn987">6</a></sup> In discourses like <em>Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em> the emphasis is on
the term <em>opanayika</em>, but there, too, the Buddha brings in all the six terms,
because they are associated in sense.</p>
<p>Let us now examine how these six epithets are associated in sense. The usual
explanation of <em>svākkhata</em>, ‘well preached’, is that the Dhamma has been
preached by the Buddha properly intoned with perfect symmetry as to the letter
and to the spirit, excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle and
excellent in the end. But the true meaning of <em>svākkhata</em> emerges when examined
from the point of view of practice.</p>
<p>The quality of being visible here and now, <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, that is not found in
an ill-preached doctrine, <em>durakkhāta dhamma</em>, is to be found in this
well-preached Dhamma. Whereas an ill-preached doctrine only promises a goal
attainable in the next world, the well-preached Dhamma points to a goal
attainable in this world itself. Therefore we have to understand the full import
of the epithet <em>svakkhāta</em> in relation to the next quality, <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>,
visible here and now.</p>
<p>We have already dealt with this quality to some extent in connection with an
episode about General Sīha in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn988-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn988">7</a></sup> Briefly stated, the
meaning of the term <em>sandiṭṭhika</em> is “visible here and now, in this very life”,
as far as the results are concerned. The same idea is conveyed by the expression
<em>diṭṭheva dhamme</em> often cited with reference to Nibbāna in the standard phrase,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>diṭṭheva dhamme sayam abhiññā sacchikatvā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn989-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn989">8</a></sup></p>
<p>having realized by one’s own higher knowledge in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas <em>samparāyika</em> stands for what comes after death, in another life,
<em>sandiṭṭhika</em> points to the attainability of results in this very life, here and
now.</p>
<p>The term <em>sandiṭṭhika</em> can be related to the next epithet <em>akālika</em>. Since the
results are attainable here and now, it does not involve an interval in time. It
is, in other words, timeless, <em>akālika</em>.</p>
<p>In our earlier sermons we brought in, as an illustration for this involvement
with time, the period of suspense after an examination, these days, awaiting
results. Nibbāna-examination, on the other hand, yields results then and there
and produces the certificate immediately. So we see the quality “visible here
and now” implicating a timelessness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the term <em>akālika</em> also suffered by much commentarial
jargon. Meanings totally foreign to the original sense came to be tagged on, so
much so that it was taken to mean ‘true for all times’ or ‘eternal’.</p>
<p>The <em>Samiddhisutta</em> in the <em>Devatāsaṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> clarifies
for us the original meaning of the term <em>akālika</em>. One day, Venerable Samiddhi
had a bath at the hot springs in Tapodārāma and was drying his body outside in
the sun. A deity seeing his handsome body gave him an advice contrary to the
spirit of the Dhamma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhuñja, bhikkhu, mānusake kāme, mā sandiṭṭhikaṁ hitvā kālikaṁ
anudhāvi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn990-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn990">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Enjoy, monk, human sensual pleasures, do not abandon what is visible here and
now and run after what takes time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Samiddhi met the challenge with the following explanatory reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na kvhāhaṁ, āvuso, sandiṭṭhikaṁ hitvā kālikaṁ anudhāvāmi. Kālikañca khvāhaṁ,
āvuso, hitvā sandiṭṭhikaṁ anudhāvāmi. Kālikā hi, āvuso, kāmā vuttā bhagavatā
bahudukkhā bahupāyāsā, ādīnavo ettha bhiyyo. Sandiṭṭhiko ayaṁ dhammo akāliko
ehipassiko opanayyiko paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi</em>.</p>
<p>It is not the case, friend, that I abandon what is visible here and now in
order to run after what involves time. On the contrary, I am abandoning what
involves time to run after what is visible here and now. For the Fortunate One
has said that sensual pleasures are time involving, fraught with much
suffering, much despair, and that more dangers lurk in them. Visible here and
now is this Dhamma, timeless, inviting one to come and see, leading one
onwards, to be realized personally by the wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation makes it clear that the two terms <em>sandiṭṭhika</em> and <em>akālika</em>
are allied in meaning. That is why <em>sandiṭṭhika</em> is contrasted with <em>kālika</em> in
the above dialogue. What comes after death is <em>kālika</em>, involving time. It may
come or may not come, one cannot be certain about it. But of what is visible
here and now, in this very life, one can be certain. There is no time gap. It is
timeless.</p>
<p>The epithet <em>akālika</em> is implicitly connected with the next epithet,
<em>ehipassika</em>. If the result can be seen here and now, without involving time,
there is good reason for the challenge: ‘Come and see!’ If the result can be
seen only in the next world, all one can say is: ‘Go and see!’</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is not the Buddha who says: ‘Come and see!’, it is the
Dhamma itself that makes this challenge. That is why the term <em>ehipassika</em> is
regarded as an epithet of the Dhamma. Dhamma itself invites the wise to come and
see.</p>
<p>Those who took up the challenge right in earnest have proved for themselves the
realizable nature of the Dhamma, which is the justification for the last
epithet, <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi</em>, “to be experienced by the wise each one
by oneself”.</p>
<p>The inviting nature of the Dhamma leads to personal experience and that
highlights the <em>opanayika</em> quality of leading onwards. True to the statement
<em>tathā tathā viharantaṁ tathattāya upanessati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn991-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn991">10</a></sup> the Dhamma leads him
onwards to appropriate states as he lives according to it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Buddha sums up the entire body of Dhamma he has preached in terms
of the thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment. Particularly in the
<em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em> we find him addressing the monks in the following
memorable words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ye te mayā dhammā abhiññā desitā, te vo sādhukaṁ
uggahetvā āsevitabbā bhāvetabbā bahulīkātabbā, yathayidaṁ brahmacariyaṁ
addhaniyaṁ assa ciraṭṭhitikaṁ, tadassa bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya
lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Katame ca te, bhikkhave, dhammā mayā abhiññā desitā ye vo sādhukaṁ uggahetvā
āsevitabbā bhāvetabbā bahulīkātabbā, yathayidaṁ brahmacariyaṁ addhaniyaṁ assa
ciraṭṭhitikaṁ, tadassa bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya
hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṁ?</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathidaṁ cattāro satipaṭṭhāna cattāro sammappadhānā cattāro iddhipādā
pañcindriyāni pañca balāni satta bojjhaṅgā ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn992-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn992">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, monks, whatever <em>dhammas</em> I have preached with higher knowledge,
you should cultivate, develop and practice thoroughly, so that this holy life
would last long and endure for a long time, thereby conducing to the wellbeing
and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the
wellbeing and the happiness of gods and men.</p>
<p>And what, monks, are those <em>dhammas</em> I have preached with higher knowledge
that you should cultivate, develop and practice thoroughly, so that this holy
life would last long and endure for a long time, thereby conducing to the
wellbeing and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the
benefit, the wellbeing and the happiness of gods and men?</p>
<p>They are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right endeavours, the
four bases for success, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors
of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This group of <em>dhammas,</em> collectively known as the thirty-seven participative
factors of enlightenment illustrates the quality of leading onwards according to
the twin principles of relativity and pragmatism.</p>
<p>It is customary in the present age to define the Dhamma from an academic point
of view as constituting a set of canonical texts, but here in this context in
the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em>, at such a crucial juncture as the final passing
away, we find the Buddha defining the Dhamma from a practical point of view,
laying emphasis on the practice. It is as if the Buddha is entrusting to the
monks a tool-kit before his departure.</p>
<p>The thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment are comparable to a
tool-kit, or rather, an assemblage of seven tool-kits. Each of these seven is
well arranged with an inner consistency. Let us now examine them.</p>
<p>First comes the four foundations of mindfulness. This group of <em>dhammas</em>
deserves pride of place due to its fundamental importance. The term
<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> has been variously interpreted by scholars, some with reference
to the term <em>paṭṭhāna</em> and others connecting it with <em>upaṭṭhāna</em>.</p>
<p>It seems more natural to associate it with the word <em>paṭṭhāna</em>, ‘foundation’, as
the basis for the practice. <em>Upaṭṭhita sati</em> is a term for one who has mastered
mindfulness, based on the four foundations, as for instance in the aphorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>upaṭṭhitasatissāyaṁ dhammo, nāyaṁ dhammo muṭṭhasatissa</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn993-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn993">12</a></sup></p>
<p>this Dhamma is for one who is attended by mindfulness, not for one who has
lost it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four foundations themselves exhibit an orderly arrangement. The four are
termed:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>kāyānupassanā</em>, contemplation on the body,</li>
<li><em>vedanānupassanā</em>, contemplation on feelings,</li>
<li><em>cittānupassanā</em>, contemplation on the mind, and</li>
<li><em>dhammānupassanā</em>, contemplation on mind-objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here we have a basis for the exercise of mindfulness beginning with a gross
object, gradually leading on to subtler objects. It is easy enough to
contemplate on the body. As one goes on setting up mindfulness on the body, one
becomes more aware of feelings and makes them, too, the object of mindfulness.
This gradual process need not be interpreted as so many cut and dried separate
stages. There is a subtle imperceptible interconnection between these four
foundations themselves.</p>
<p>To one who has practiced contemplation on the body, not only pleasant and
unpleasant feelings, but also neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling,
imperceptible to ordinary people, becomes an object for mindfulness. So also are
the subtler distinctions between worldly, <em>sāmisa</em>, and unworldly, <em>nirāmisa</em>,
feelings.</p>
<p>As one progresses to <em>cittānupassanā</em>, contemplation on the mind, one becomes
aware of the colour-light system of the mind in response to feelings, the
alternations between a lustful mind, <em>sarāgaṁ cittaṁ</em>, a hateful mind, <em>sadosaṁ
cittaṁ</em>, and a deluded mind, <em>samohaṁ cittaṁ</em>, as well as their opposites.</p>
<p>Further on in his practice he becomes conversant with the wirings underlying
this colour-light system of the mind and the know-how necessary for controlling
it. With <em>dhammānupassanā</em> he is gaining the skill in avoiding and overcoming
negative mental states and encouraging and stabilizing positive mental states.</p>
<p>Let us now see whether there is any connection between the four foundations of
mindfulness and the four right endeavours. For purposes of illustration we may
take up the subsection on the hindrances, included under <em>dhammānupassanā</em>,
contemplation on mind-objects. There we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā ca anuppannassa kāmacchandassa uppādo hoti, tañ ca pajānāti; yathā ca
uppannassa kāmacchandassa pahānaṁ hoti tañ ca pajānāti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn994-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn994">13</a></sup></p>
<p>And he also understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen sensual
desire, and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen sensual desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two statements in the subsection on the hindrances could be related to the
first two out of the four right endeavours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anuppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ anuppādāya chandaṁ janeti
vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati; uppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ
akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ
paggaṇhāti padahati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn995-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn995">14</a></sup></p>
<p>For the non-arising of unarisen evil unskilful mental states he arouses a
desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours; for the abandoning of arisen evil unskilful mental states he
arouses a desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The understanding of the hindrances is the pre-condition for this right
endeavour. What we have in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> is a statement to the effect
that one comprehends, <em>pajānāti</em>, the way hindrances arise as well as the way
they are abandoned. Right endeavour is already implicated. With mindfulness and
full awareness one sees what is happening. But that is not all. Right endeavour
has to step in.</p>
<p>Just as the first two right endeavours are relevant to the subsection on the
hindrances, the next two right endeavours could be related to the following two
statements in the subsection on the enlightenment factors in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yathā ca anuppannassa satisambojjhaṅgassa uppādo hoti, tañ ca pajānāti; yathā
ca uppannassa satisambojjhaṅgassa bhāvanāpāripūrī hoti tañ ca
pajānāti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn996-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn996">15</a></sup></p>
<p>And he also understands how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen
mindfulness enlightenment factor, and how the arisen mindfulness enlightenment
factor comes to fulfilment by development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can compare these two aspects of the <em>dhammānupassanā</em> section in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> with the two right endeavours on the positive side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anuppannānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ uppādāya chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ
ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati; uppannānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ ṭhitiyā
asammosāya bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya bhāvanāya pāripūriyā chandaṁ janeti
vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn997-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn997">16</a></sup></p>
<p>For the arising of unarisen skilful mental states he arouses a desire, makes
an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and endeavours; for the
stability, non-remiss, increase, amplitude and fulfilment by development of
arisen skilful mental states he arouses a desire, makes an effort, puts forth
energy, makes firm the mind and endeavours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the right endeavour regarding skilful mental states. Why we refer to
this aspect in particular is that there is at present a tendency among those who
recommend <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation to overemphasize the role of attention. They
seem to assert that bare attention or noticing is all that is needed. The reason
for such an attitude is probably the attempt to specialize in <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> in
isolation, without reference to the rest of the thirty-seven participative
factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p>These seven tool-kits are interconnected. From the <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> tool-kit, the
<em>sammappadhāna</em> tool-kit comes out as a matter of course. That is why bare
attention is not the be all and end all of it.</p>
<p>Proper attention is actually the basis for right endeavour. Even when a machine
is out of order, there is a need for tightening or loosening somewhere. But
first of all one has to mindfully scan or scrutinize it. That is why there is no
explicit reference to effort in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>. But based on that
scrutiny, the four right endeavours play their role in regard to unskilful and
skilful mental states. So we see the close relationship between the four
foundations of mindfulness and the four right endeavours.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to examine the relationship between the four right
endeavours and the four paths to success. We have already quoted a phrase that
is commonly used with reference to all the four right endeavours, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati</em>,</p>
<p>arouses a desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a string of terms suggestive of striving, systematically arranged
in an ascending order.</p>
<p><em>Chandaṁ janeti</em> refers to the interest or the desire to act.</p>
<p><em>Vāyamati</em> suggests effort or exercise.</p>
<p><em>Viriyaṁ ārabhati</em> has to do with the initial application of energy.</p>
<p><em>Cittaṁ paggaṇhāti</em> stands for that firmness of resolve or grit.</p>
<p><em>Padahati</em> signifies the final all out effort or endeavour.</p>
<p>These terms more or less delineate various stages in a progressive effort. One
who practices the four right endeavours in course of time specializes in one or
the other of the four bases for success, <em>iddhipāda</em>. That is why the four bases
for success are traceable to the four right endeavours.</p>
<p>To illustrate the connection between the right endeavours and the four bases for
success, let us take up a simile. Suppose there is a rock which we want to get
out of our way. We wish to topple it over. Since our wishing it away is not
enough, we put some kind of lever underneath it and see whether it responds to
our wish. Even if the rock is unusually obstinate, we at least give our
shoulders an exercise, <em>vāyamati</em>, in preparation for the effort.</p>
<p>Once we are ready, we heave slowly slowly, <em>viriyaṁ ārabhati</em>. But then it looks
as if the rock is precariously balanced, threatening to roll back. So we grit
our teeth and make a firm resolve, <em>cittaṁ paggaṇhāti</em>.</p>
<p>Now comes the last decisive spurt. With one deep breath, well aware that it
could be our last if the rock had its own way, we push it away with all our
might. It is this last all out endeavour that in the highest sense is called
<em>sammappadhāna</em> or right endeavour.</p>
<p>In the context of the right endeavour for enlightenment it is called
<em>caturaṅgasamannāgata viriya</em> “effort accompanied by four factors”,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn998-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn998">17</a></sup>
which is worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kāmaṁ taco ca nahāru ca aṭṭhi ca avasissatu, sarīre upasussatu maṁsalohitaṁ,
yaṁ taṁ purisathāmena purisaviriyena purisaparakkamena pattabbaṁ na taṁ
apāpuṇitvā viriyassa saṇṭhānaṁ bhavissati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn999-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn999">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Verily let my skin, sinews and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry
up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained
what can be attained by manly strength, by manly energy, by manly exertion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though as an illustration we took an ordinary worldly object, a rock, one can
substitute for it the gigantic mass of suffering to make it meaningful in the
context of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>It is the formula for the toppling of this mass of suffering that is enshrined
in the phrase <em>chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti
padahati</em>, “arouses a desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the
mind and endeavours”.</p>
<p>The four bases for success, <em>iddhipāda</em>, namely <em>chanda</em>, ‘desire’; <em>viriya</em>,
‘energy’; <em>citta</em>, ‘mind’; and <em>vīmaṁsā</em>, ‘investigation’, to a great extent are
already implicit in the above formula.</p>
<p>Clearly enough, <em>chandaṁ janeti</em> represents <em>chanda-iddhipāda</em>; <em>vāyamati</em> and
<em>viriyaṁ ārabhati</em> together stand for <em>viriya-iddhipāda</em>; while <em>cittaṁ
paggaṇhāti</em> stands for the power of determination implied by <em>citta-iddhipāda</em>.</p>
<p>Apparently investigation, <em>vīmaṁsā</em>, as an <em>iddhipāda</em>, has no representative in
the above formula. However, in the process of mindfully going over and over
again through these stages in putting forth effort one becomes an adept in the
art of handling a situation. In fact, <em>vīmaṁsā</em>, or investigation, is <em>paññā</em>,
or wisdom, in disguise.</p>
<p>Even toppling a rock is not a simple task. One has to have the knowhow in order
to accomplish it. So then, all the four bases for success emerge from the four
right endeavours.</p>
<p>What is meant by <em>iddhipāda</em>? Since the word <em>iddhi</em> is associated with psychic
power,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1000-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1000">19</a></sup> it is easy to mistake it as a base for psychic power.</p>
<p>But the basic sense of <em>iddhi</em> is ‘success’ or ‘proficiency’. For instance,
<em>samiddhi</em> means ‘prosperity’. It is perhaps more appropriate to render it as a
‘base for success’, because for the attainment of Nibbāna, also, the development
of the <em>iddhipādas</em> is recommended. Going by the illustration given above, we
may say in general that for all mundane and supramundane accomplishments, the
four bases hold good to some extent or other.</p>
<p>In the <em>Iddhipādasaṁyutta</em> these four bases for success are described as four
ways to accomplish the task of attaining influx-free deliverance of the mind and
deliverance by wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1001-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1001">20</a></sup></p>
<p>With the experience gathered in the course of practising the fourfold right
endeavour, one comes to know one’s strongpoint, where one’s forte lies. One
might recognize <em>chanda</em>, desire or interest, as one’s strongpoint and give it
first place. In the case of the bases for success, it is said that even one
would do, as the others fall in line.</p>
<p>According to the commentaries, Venerable Raṭṭhapāla of the Buddha’s time
belonged to the <em>chanda</em>-category, and Venerable Mogharāja had <em>vīmaṁsa</em> as his
forte, excelling in wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1002-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1002">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Someone might get so interested in a particular course of action and get an
intense desire and tell himself: “Somehow I must do it.” To that wish the others
– energy, determination and investigation – become subservient.</p>
<p>Another might discover that his true personality emerges in the thick of
striving. So he would make energy the base for success in his quest for Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Yet another has, as his strong point, a steel determination. The other three
fall in line with it.</p>
<p>One who belongs to the wisdom category is never tired of investigation. He, even
literally, leaves no stone unturned if he gets curious to see what lies
underneath.</p>
<p>The fact that there is a normative tendency for <em>iddhipādas</em> to work in unison
comes to light in the description of <em>iddhipāda</em> meditation in the <em>Saṁyutta
Nikāya</em>. For instance, in regard to <em>chanda-iddhipāda</em>, we find the descriptive
initial statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu chandasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṁ iddhipādaṁ
bhāveti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1003-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1003">22</a></sup></p>
<p>herein, monks, a monk develops the base for success that is equipped with
preparations for endeavour, arising from desire-concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is this <em>chandasamādhi</em> or ‘desire-concentration’? This strange type of
concentration, not to be found in other contexts, is explained in the
<em>Chandasutta</em> itself as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chandaṁ ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu nissāya labhati samādhiṁ labhati cittassa
ekaggataṁ, ayaṁ vuccati chandasamādhi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1004-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1004">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If by relying on desire, monks, a monk gets concentration, gets
one-pointedness of mind, this is called ‘desire-concentration’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to sheer interest or desire, a monk might reach a steady state of mind, like
some sort of concentration. With that as his basis, he applies himself to the
four right endeavours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So anuppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ anuppādāya chandaṁ janeti
vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati; uppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ
akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ
paggaṇhāti padahati; anuppannānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ uppādāya chandaṁ
janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti padahati; uppannānaṁ
kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ ṭhitiyā asammosāya bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya bhāvanāya
pāripūriyā chandaṁ janeti vāyamati viriyaṁ ārabhati cittaṁ paggaṇhāti
padahati.</em></p>
<p>For the non-arising of unarisen evil unskilful mental states he arouses a
desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours; for the abandoning of arisen evil unskilful mental states he
arouses a desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours; for the arising of unarisen skilful mental states he arouses a
desire, makes an effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and
endeavours; for the stability, non-remiss, increase, amplitude and fulfilment
by development of arisen skilful mental states he arouses a desire, makes an
effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and endeavours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here, again, the standard definition of the four right endeavours is given.
The implication is that, once the base for success is ready, the four right
endeavours take off from it. The four bases for success are therefore so many
ways of specializing in various aspects of striving, with a view to wielding the
four right endeavours all the more effectively. All the constituents of right
endeavour harmoniously fall in line with the four bases for success.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a concept of four types of concentrations as bases for right
endeavour, <em>chandasamādhi</em>, desire-concentration; <em>viriyasamādhi</em>,
energy-concentration; <em>cittasamādhi</em>, mind-concentration; and <em>vīmaṁsasamādhi</em>,
investigation-concentration.</p>
<p>Now what is meant by <em>padhānasaṅkhārā</em>, “preparations for right endeavour”? It
refers to the practice of the four right endeavours with one or the other base
as a solid foundation. <em>Padhāna</em> is endeavour or all out effort. <em>Saṅkhārā</em> are
those preparations directed towards it. Finally, the Buddha analyses the long
compound to highlight its constituents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti ayaṁ ca chando, ayaṁ ca chandasamādhi, ime ca padhānasaṅkhārā; ayaṁ
vuccati, bhikkhave, chandasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgato iddhipādo.</em></p>
<p>Thus this desire, and this desire-concentration, and these preparations for
endeavour; this is called the base for success that is equipped with
preparations for endeavour, arising from desire-concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we see how the four bases for success come out of the four right endeavours.</p>
<p>The relation between the four bases for success and the next tool-kit, the five
faculties, <em>pañcindriya</em>, may not be so clear. But there is an implicit
connection which might need some explanation.</p>
<p>The five faculties here meant are faith, <em>saddhā</em>; energy, <em>viriya</em>;
mindfulness, <em>sati</em>; concentration, <em>samādhi</em>; and wisdom, <em>paññā</em>.</p>
<p>The four bases for success provide the proper environment for the arising of the
five faculties. The term <em>indriya</em>, faculty, has connotations of dominance and
control. When one has specialized in the bases for success, it is possible to
give predominance to certain mental states.</p>
<p><em>Saddhā</em>, or faith, is <em>chanda</em>, desire or interest, in disguise. It is in one
who has faith and confidence that desire and interest arise. With keen interest
in skilful mental states one is impelled to take an initiative. The Buddha gives
the following description of <em>saddhindriya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha ca, bhikkhave, saddhindriyaṁ daṭṭhabbaṁ? Catusu
sotāpattiyaṅgesu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1005-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1005">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Where, monks, is the faculty of faith to be seen? In the four factors of
stream-entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four factors of stream-entry, briefly stated, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>buddhe aveccappasādena samannāgato,</em> <br />
He is endowed with confidence born of understanding in the Buddha;</li>
<li><em>dhamme aveccappasādena samannāgato,</em> <br />
he is endowed with confidence born of understanding in the Dhamma;</li>
<li><em>saṅghe aveccappasādena samannāgato,</em> <br />
he is endowed with confidence born of understanding in the Saṅgha;</li>
<li><em>ariyakantehi sīlehi samannāgato.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1006-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1006">25</a></sup> <br />
he is endowed with virtues dear to the Noble Ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>The stream-winner has a deep faith in the Buddha, in the Dhamma and in the
Saṅgha that is born of understanding. His virtue is also of a higher order,
since it is well based on that faith. So in the definition of the faculty of
faith we have an echo of <em>chanda-iddhipāda</em>.</p>
<p>It can also be inferred that <em>viriyindriya</em>, the faculty of energy, also takes
off from the energy base for success. We are told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha ca, bhikkhave, viriyindriyaṁ daṭṭhabbaṁ? Catusu
sammapadhānesu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1007-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1007">26</a></sup></p>
<p>And where, monks, is the faculty of energy to be seen? In the four right
endeavours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The faculty of energy is obviously nurtured by the four right endeavours and the
four bases for success.</p>
<p>The antecedents of <em>satindriya</em>, the faculty of mindfulness, may not be so
obvious. But from the stage of <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> onwards it has played its silent
role impartially throughout almost unseen. Here, too, it stands in the middle of
the group of leaders without taking sides. In fact, its role is the preserving
of the balance of power between those who are on either side, the balancing of
faculties.</p>
<p>About the place of <em>satindriya</em> the Buddha says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha ca, bhikkhave, satindriyaṁ daṭṭhabbaṁ? Catusu satipaṭṭhānesu.</em></p>
<p>And where, monks, is the faculty of mindfulness to be seen? In the four
foundations of mindfulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the same four foundations, now reinforced by greater experience in
vigilance.</p>
<p>Then comes the faculty of concentration, <em>samādhindriya</em>. We already had a
glimpse of it at the <em>iddhipāda</em>-stage as <em>chandasamādhi</em>, desire-concentration;
<em>viriyasamādhi</em>, energy-concentration; <em>cittasamādhi</em>, mind-concentration; and
<em>vīmaṁsasamādhi</em>, investigation-concentration.</p>
<p>But it was only a steadiness or stability that serves as a make shift launching
pad for concentrated effort. But here in this context <em>samādhindriya</em> has a more
refined sense. It is formally defined with reference to the four <em>jhānic</em>
attainments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha ca, bhikkhave, samādhindriyaṁ daṭṭhabbaṁ? Catusu jhānesu.</em></p>
<p>And where, monks, is the faculty of concentration to be seen? In the four
absorptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, rather exceptionally, another definition is also given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako vossaggārammanaṁ karitvā labhati samādhiṁ
labhati cittass’ekaggataṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1008-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1008">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Herein, monks, a noble disciple gains concentration, gains one-pointedness of
mind, having made release its object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it is by the development of the bases for success that concentration
emerges as a full-fledged faculty.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the faculty of wisdom, <em>paññindriya</em>. Though it has some
relation to <em>vīmaṁsā</em> or investigation as a base for success, it is defined
directly with reference to the four noble truths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kattha ca, bhikkhave, paññindriyaṁ daṭṭhabbaṁ? Catusu ariyasaccesu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1009-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1009">28</a></sup></p>
<p>And where, monks, is the faculty of wisdom to be seen? In the four noble
truths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, in the four noble truths, too, we see some parallelism with the
illustration for <em>iddhipādas</em> we picked up. Suffering, its arising, its
cessation and the path to its cessation is comparable to our reactions to our
encounter with that stumbling block – the rock.</p>
<p>In the context of insight, <em>paññindriya</em> is defined in terms of the knowledge of
rise and fall, <em>udayatthagāmini paññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1010-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1010">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The sharpness of faculties may vary from person to person, according to their
<em>saṁsāric</em> background. The Buddha, who could see this difference between
persons, <em>puggalavemattatā</em>, was able to tame them easily.</p>
<p>As we have already mentioned, mindfulness is in the middle of this group of
faculties. Being the main stay of the entire <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice, it renders
a vigilant service in silence here too, as the arbiter in the struggle for power
between the two factions on either side.</p>
<p>Now that they have the dominance, <em>saddhā</em>, faith, and <em>paññā</em>, wisdom, drag to
either side, wishing to go their own way. Mindfulness has to strike a balance
between them. Likewise <em>viriya</em>, energy, and <em>samādhi</em>, concentration, left to
themselves tend to become extravagant and mindfulness has to caution them to be
moderate. So in this tool-kit of faculties, <em>sati</em> is the spanner for tightening
or loosening, for relaxing or gripping.</p>
<p>Alternatively one can discern another orderly arrangement among these five
faculties. In the <em>Indriyasaṁyutta</em> Venerable Sāriputta extols the wonderful
inner coherence between these faculties before the Buddha in the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saddhassa hi, bhante, ariyasāvakassa etaṁ pāṭikaṅkhaṁ yaṁ āraddhaviriyo
viharissati akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya, kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ upasampadāya,
thāmava daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu. Yaṁ hissa, bhante,
viriyaṁ tadassa viriyindriyaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Saddhassa hi, bhante, ariyasāvakassa āraddhaviriyassa etaṁ pāṭikaṅkhaṁ yaṁ
satimā bhavissati, paramena satinepakkena samannāgato, cirkatampi
cirabhāsitampi saritā anussaritā. Yā hissa, bhante, sati tadassa satindriyaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Saddhassa hi, bhante, ariyasāvakassa āraddhaviriyassa upaṭṭhitasatino etaṁ

<p><em>Saddhassa hi, bhante, ariyasāvakassa āraddhaviriyassa upaṭṭhitasatino
samāhitacittassa etaṁ pāṭikaṅkhaṁ yaṁ evaṁ pajānissati:</em></p>
<p><em>“Anamataggo kho saṁsāro, pubbā koṭi na paññāyati avijjānīvaraṇānaṁ sattānaṁ

<p><em>Yā hissa, bhante, paññā tadassa paññindriyaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1011-1"><a href="sermon-31.html#fn-fn1011">30</a></sup></p>
<p>It could indeed be expected, Venerable Sir, of a noble disciple who has faith
that he will dwell with energy put forth for the abandoning of unskilful
states and the arising of skilful states, that he will be steady, resolute in
exertion, not shirking the burden of fulfilling skilful states. That energy of
his, Venerable Sir, is his faculty of energy.</p>
<p>It could indeed be expected, Venerable Sir, of that noble disciple who has
faith and who has put forth energy that he will be mindful, endowed with
supreme adeptness in mindfulness, one who remembers and recollects what was
done and said even long ago. That mindfulness of his, Venerable Sir, is his
faculty of mindfulness.</p>
<p>It could indeed be expected, Venerable Sir, of that noble disciple who has
faith, who has put forth energy and who is attended by mindfulness that he
will gain concentration, will gain one-pointedness of mind, having made
release the object. That concentration of his, Venerable Sir, is his faculty
of concentration.</p>
<p>It could indeed be expected, Venerable Sir, of that noble disciple who has
faith, who has put forth energy, who is attended by mindfulness and whose mind
is concentrated that he will understand thus:</p>
<p>“This <em>saṁsāra</em> is without a conceivable beginning, a first point is not
discernable of beings roaming and wandering, hindered by ignorance and
fettered by craving. But the remainderless fading away and cessation of
ignorance, the mass of darkness, this is the peaceful state, this is the
excellent state, that is, the stilling of all preparations, the relinquishment
of all assets, the destruction of craving, detachment, cessation, extinction.”</p>
<p>That wisdom of his, Venerable Sir, is his faculty of wisdom.</p>

</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the thirty-second sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the course of our last sermon, we took up the position that the seven groups
of doctrinal categories collectively known as the thirty-seven participative
factors of enlightenment follow an extremely practical and systematic order of
arrangement. By way of proof, we discussed at some length the inner consistency
evident within each group and the way the different groups are related to each
other.</p>
<p>So far, we have pointed out how the setting up of mindfulness through the four
foundations of mindfulness serves as a solid basis for the four ways of putting
forth energy, by the four right endeavours; and how the progressive stages in
putting forth energy, outlined by the four right endeavours, give rise to the
four bases for success. It was while discussing the way in which the four bases
for success are helpful in arousing the five faculties, like faith, that we had
to stop our last sermon.</p>
<p>It should be sufficiently clear, after our discussion the other day, that the
four factors desire, energy, determination and investigation could be made the
base for success in any venture.</p>
<p>The five faculties, however, are directly relevant to Nibbāna. That is why faith
is given pride of place among the faculties. <em>Saddhindriya</em>, or the faculty of
faith, takes the lead, which is obviously related to <em>chanda</em>, desire or
interest. But the element of faith in <em>saddhindriya</em> is defined at a higher
level. In this context, it is reckoned as the firm faith characteristic of the
stream-winner.</p>
<p>Then comes the faculty of energy, <em>viriyindriya</em>. Though apparently it is yet
another occurrence of the term, <em>viriya</em> in this context is that element of
energy weathered and reinforced by its fourfold application as a base for
success, <em>iddhipāda</em>.</p>
<p>As for <em>samādhi</em> or concentration, we already came across the terms
<em>chandasamādhi, viriyasamādhi, cittasamādhi</em> and <em>vīmaṁsāsamādhi</em> in the
description of the development of the bases for success. The concentration meant
by <em>samādhi</em> in that context is actually a one-pointedness of the mind,
<em>cittekaggatā</em>, which could be made the basis for arousing energy.</p>
<p>But the level of concentration envisaged by the concentration faculty,
<em>samādhindriya</em>, is of a higher grade as far as its potential is concerned. It
is defined as the first four <em>jhānas</em>, based on which one can develop insight
and attain Nibbāna. In fact, there is a statement to that effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako vossaggārammaṇam karitvā labhati samādhiṁ,
labhati cittassa ekaggataṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1013-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1013">2</a></sup></p>
<p>herein, monks, a noble disciple gains concentration, gains one-pointedness of
mind, having made the release [of Nibbāna] its object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>vossagga</em> connotes Nibbāna as a giving up or relinquishment. So the
concentration faculty is that concentration which is directed towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Similarly the wisdom faculty, as defined here, is of the highest degree,
pertaining to the understanding of the four noble truths. Sometimes it is called
the “noble penetrative wisdom of rise and fall”, <em>udayatthagāminī paññā ariyā
nibbedhikā</em>. By implication, it is equivalent to the factor called <em>vīmaṁsā</em>,
investigation, we came across in our discussion of the bases for success. As a
faculty, it comes out full-fledged in the guise of wisdom.</p>
<p>The mindfulness faculty, which stands in the middle, fulfils a very important
function. Now in the context of the four foundations of mindfulness, the role of
mindfulness is the simple task of being aware of the appropriate object
presented to it. But here in this domain of faculties, mindfulness has attained
lordship and fulfils an important function. It maintains the balance between the
two sets of pair-wise faculties, by equalizing faith with wisdom and energy with
concentration.</p>
<p>This function of balancing of faculties, which mindfulness fulfils, has a
special practical value. To one who is striving for Nibbāna, balancing of
faculties could sometimes be an intricate problem, since it is more easily said
than done.</p>
<p>In order to unravel this problem, let us take up the simile of the rock, we
employed the other day. We discussed the question of toppling a rock as an
illustration to understand the various stages in the four-fold right endeavour.
We distinguished the five stages in putting forth effort in the phrase <em>chandaṁ
janeti, vāyamati, viriyaṁ ārabhati, cittaṁ paggaṇhāti, padahati</em> with the help
of that illustration. Out of these stages, the last one represented by the word
<em>padahati</em> shows the climax. <em>Padhāna</em> or endeavour is the highest grade of
effort.</p>
<p>Even verbally it implies something like toppling a rock, which requires a high
degree of momentum. This momentum has to be built up mindfully and gradually.
That rock, in our illustration, was levered up with great difficulty. After it
was levered up, there came that dangerous situation, when it threatened to roll
back. It called for that supreme purposeful effort, which required the zeal of
self sacrifice. That zealous endeavour is made at the risk of one’s body and
life.</p>
<p>But even there, one has to be cautious and mindful. If excessive energy is
applied in that last heave, one would be thrown off head over heels after the
rock. If insufficient energy is applied the rock would roll back and one would
get crushed. That is why a balancing is needed before the last spurt. Right
endeavour has to be preceded by a balancing.</p>
<p>It is this preliminary balancing that finds mention in a certain highly
significant statement in the <em>Caṅkīsutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, where we are
told how a person arouses faith in the Dhamma and gradually develops it and puts
forth effort and endeavour and attains Nibbāna. To quote the relevant section of
that long sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>chandajāto ussahati, ussahitvā tuleti, tulayitvā padahati, pahitatto samāno
kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti, paññāya ca naṁ ativijjha
passati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1014-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1014">3</a></sup></p>
<p>having aroused a desire or keen interest, he strives; having strived, he
balances; having balanced or equalized, he endeavours; and with that endeavour
he realizes the highest truth by his body and penetrates into it with wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the key word here, <em>tulayati</em> or <em>tuleti</em>, is explained in a
different way in the commentary. It is interpreted as a reference to
contemplation on insight, <em>aniccādivasena tīreti</em>, “adjudges as impermanent,
etc.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1015-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1015">4</a></sup></p>
<p>But if we examine the word within the context here, as it occurs between
<em>ussahati</em>, ‘strives’ (literally ‘bearing up’ or ‘enduring’), and <em>padahati</em>,
‘endeavours’, the obvious meaning is ‘equalizing’ or ‘balancing’.</p>
<p><em>Tuleti</em> has connotations of weighing and judging, and one who strives to lift
up a rock needs to know how heavy it is and how much effort is required to
topple it. By merely looking at the rock, without trying to lift it up, one
cannot say how much effort is needed to topple it. One has to put one’s shoulder
to it. In fact the word <em>ussahati</em> is suggestive of enduring effort with which
one bears up.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Buddha uses the term <em>ussoḷhī</em> to designate that steadily enduring
effort – literally, the bearing up. A clear instance of the occurrence of this
term in this sense can be found among the Eights of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> in a
discourse on the recollection of death, <em>maraṇasati</em>. The sutta is an
exhortation to the monks to make use of the recollection of death to reflect on
one’s unskilful mental states daily in the morning and in the evening with a
view to strengthen one’s determination to abandon them. For instance, we find
the following exhortation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sace, bhikkhave, bhikkhu paccavekkhamāno evaṁ pajānāti: ’atthi me pāpakā
akusalā dhammā appahīnā ye me assu rattiṁ kālaṁ karontassa antarāyāyā’ti,
tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṁ yeva pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya
adhimatto chando ca vāyāmo ca ussāho ca ussoḷhi ca appaṭivānī ca sati ca
sampajaññañca karaṇīyaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1016-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1016">5</a></sup></p>
<p>If, monks, upon reflection a monk understands: ‘There are in me unabandoned
evil unskilful states which could spell danger to me if I die today’, then,
monks, for the abandonment of those very evil unskilful states that monk
should arouse a high degree of desire, effort, striving, enduring effort,
unremitting effort, mindfulness and full awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequence of terms <em>chando, vāyāmo, ussāho, ussoḷhi, appaṭivānī, sati</em> and
<em>sampajañña</em> is particularly significant in this long sentence.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is that desire to abandon evil unskilful states, <em>vāyāma</em> is the
initial effort, <em>ussāha</em> is literally putting the shoulder to the task,
<em>ussoḷhi</em> is bearing it up with endurance, <em>appaṭivānī</em> is unshrinking effort or
unremitting effort. <em>Sati</em> is that mindfulness and <em>sampajañña</em> that full
awareness which are indispensable in this sustained unremitting endeavour.</p>
<p>If a better illustration is needed to clarify the idea of balancing, prior to
the final endeavour, we may take the case of lifting a log of wood. Here we have
an actual lifting up or putting one’s shoulder to it. Without lifting up a log
of wood and putting one’s shoulder to it, one cannot get to know the art of
balancing.</p>
<p>If, for instance, the log of wood is thick at one end and thin at the other end,
one cannot locate the centre of gravity at a glance. So one puts one’s shoulder
to one end and goes on lifting it up. It is when one reaches the centre of
gravity that one is able to balance it on one’s shoulder and take it away. It is
because we are looking at this question of balancing of faculties from a
practical point of view that we made this detour in explanation.</p>
<p>So, then, the mindfulness faculty is also performing a very important function
among these faculties. From the <em>Saddhāsutta</em> we quoted the other day we could
see that there is also a gradual arrangement in this group of five faculties.
That is to say, in a person with faith, energy arises. One who is energetic is
keen on developing mindfulness. In one who is mindful, concentration grows; and
one who has concentration attains wisdom.</p>
<p>This gradual arrangement becomes all the more meaningful since the faculty of
wisdom is declared the chief among the faculties. In the <em>Indriya Saṁyutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> the Buddha gives a number of similes to show that the
wisdom faculty is supreme in this group.</p>
<p>Just as the lion is supreme among animals, and the footprint of the elephant is
the biggest of all footprints, the wisdom faculty is supreme among
faculties.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1017-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1017">6</a></sup> The Buddha even goes on to point out that until the wisdom
faculty steps in, the other four faculties do not get established. This he makes
clear by the simile of the gabled hall in the <em>Mallikasutta</em> of the <em>Indriya
Saṁyutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as, monks, in a gabled hall, so long as the roof peak has not been
raised, the rafters are not conjoined, the rafters are not held in place, even
so, as long as the noble knowledge has not arisen in a noble disciple, the
four faculties are not conjoined, the four faculties are not held in
place.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1018-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1018">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until one becomes a stream-winner, the five faculties do not get established in
him, since the wisdom faculty is so integral. At least one has to be on the path
to attaining the fruit of a stream-winner.</p>
<p>It is said that the five faculties are to be found only in the eight noble
persons, the four treading on the paths to the four fruits and the four who have
attained the fruits of the path, <em>cattāro ca paṭipannā, cattāro ca phale ṭhitā.</em></p>
<p>In others, they are weak and not properly harnessed. It is in the <em>arahant</em> that
the wisdom faculty is found in its strongest form. In the other grades of
supramundane attainment, they are weaker by degrees. The lowest grade is the one
treading the path to stream-winning. In the worldling they are not at all to be
found, in any way, <em>sabbena sabbaṁ sabbathā sabbaṁ natthi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1019-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1019">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Next comes the group of five powers. As to their function, some explanation
might be necessary, though it seems simple enough. As we have already mentioned,
the term <em>indriya</em> connotes kingship or lordship. Faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom were elevated to the position of a king or lord. They
have attained sovereignty. So now they are exercising their power.</p>
<p>For what purpose? To put down the evil unskilful mental states that rise in
revolt against Nibbāna. The noble disciple uses the same faculties as powers to
fight out the hindrances and break the fetters. That is why among the
participative factors of enlightenment they are represented as powers, by virtue
of their special function.</p>
<p>Then we come to the category called seven factors of enlightenment. A high
degree of importance is attached to this particular group. It has an orderly
arrangement. The constituents are: <em>sati</em>, mindfulness; <em>dhammavicaya</em>,
investigation of states; <em>viriya</em>, energy; <em>pīti</em>, joy; <em>passaddhi</em>, calmness;
<em>samādhi</em>, concentration; <em>upekkhā</em>, equanimity.</p>
<p>In this group of seven, mindfulness takes precedence. In fact, the arrangement
resembles the mobilization for winning that freedom of Nibbāna. The <em>bojjhaṅgā</em>,
factors of enlightenment, are so-called because they are conducive to
enlightenment, <em>bodhāya saṁvattanti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1020-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1020">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sati</em> leads the way and at the same time marshals the squad. Three members of
the group, namely <em>dhammavicaya, viriya</em> and <em>pīti</em> are by nature restless,
while the other three, <em>passaddhi, samādhi</em> and <em>upekkhā</em> are rather slack. They
have to be marshalled and properly aligned, and <em>sati</em> comes to the forefront
for that purpose.</p>
<p>At the same time, one can discern an orderly arrangement within this group.
Right from the stage of the four foundations of mindfulness, the same term
<em>sati</em> seems to occur down the line, but its function differs in different
contexts. Now in this context, it is specifically called a <em>bojjhaṅga</em>, a factor
of enlightenment. The phrase <em>satisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti</em>, “he develops the
enlightenment factor of mindfulness”, is directly used with reference to it
here.</p>
<p>When one develops a particular meditation subject, whether it be mindfulness of
breathing, <em>ānāpānasati</em>, or even one of the four divine abidings of loving
kindness, <em>mettā</em>, compassion, <em>karuṇā</em>, altruistic joy, <em>muditā</em>, or
equanimity, <em>upekkhā</em>, one can arouse these enlightenment factors. That is why
we come across, in the <em>Indriya Saṁyutta</em>, for instance, such statements as the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu mettāsahagataṁ satisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti
vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1021-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1021">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Herein monks, a monk develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness imbued
with loving kindness, based upon seclusion, dispassion and cessation, maturing
in release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the four terms <em>viveka</em>, seclusion, <em>virāga</em>, dispassion, <em>nirodha</em>,
cessation, and <em>vossagga</em>, release, are suggestive of Nibbāna. So,
<em>satisambojjhaṅga</em> implies the development of mindfulness as an enlightenment
factor, directed towards the attainment of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>What follows in the wake of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, once it is
aroused, is the enlightenment factor of investigation of states,
<em>dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga</em>, which in fact is the function it fulfils. For
instance, in the <em>Ānandasutta</em> we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>so tathā sato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicarati
parivīmaṁsamāpajjati</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1022-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1022">11</a></sup></p>
<p>dwelling thus mindfully, he investigates that mental state with wisdom, goes
over it mentally and makes an examination of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mental state refers to the particular subject of meditation, and by
investigating it with wisdom and mentally going over it and examining it, the
meditator arouses energy. So, from this enlightenment factor one draws
inspiration and arouses energy. It is also conducive to the development of
wisdom.</p>
<p>This enlightenment factor of investigation of states gives rise to the
enlightenment factor of energy since the mental activity implied by it keeps him
wakeful and alert, as the following phrase implies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>āraddhaṁ hoti viriyaṁ asallīnaṁ</em>,</p>
<p>energy is stirred up and not inert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To one who has stirred up energy, there arises a joy of the spiritual type,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>āraddhaviriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of one who is joyful in mind, the body also calms down,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati,</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so too the mind,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cittampi passambhati.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mind of one who is calm in body and blissful gets concentrated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now the enlightenment factor of concentration has also come up. What comes
after the enlightenment factor of concentration is the enlightenment factor of
equanimity. About it, it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>so tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti,</em></p>
<p>he rightly looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the mind is concentrated, there is no need to struggle or strive. With
equanimity one has to keep watch and ward over it.</p>
<p>As an enlightenment factor, equanimity can be evalued from another angle. It is
the proper basis for the knowledge of things as they are, <em>yathābhūtañāṇa</em>. The
neutrality that goes with equanimity not only stabilizes concentration, but also
makes one receptive to the knowledge of things as they are. So here we have the
seven factors conducive to enlightenment.</p>
<p>What comes next, as the last of the seven groups, is the noble eightfold path,
<em>ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo</em>, which is reckoned as the highest among them.</p>
<p>There is some speciality even in the naming of this group. All the other groups
show a plural ending, <em>cattāro satipaṭṭhānā, cattāro sammappadhānā, cattāro
iddhipādā, pañc’indriyāni, pañca balāni, satta bojjhaṅgā</em>, but this group has a
singular ending, <em>ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo</em>. The collective sense is suggestive of
the fact that this is the <em>magga-samādhi</em>, the path concentration. The noble
eightfold path is actually the presentation of that concentration of the
supramundane path with its constituents. The singular ending is therefore
understandable.</p>
<p>This fact comes to light particularly in the <em>Mahācattārīsakasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. It is a discourse that brings out a special analysis of the
noble eightfold path. There, the Buddha explains to the monks the noble right
concentration with its supportive conditions and requisite factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamo ca, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi sa-upaniso saparikkhāro? Seyyathidaṁ
sammā diṭṭhi, sammā saṅkappo, sammā vācā, sammā kammanto, sammā ājīvo, sammā
vāyāmo sammā sati, yā kho, bhikkhave, imehi sattahaṅgehi cittassa ekaggatā
parikkhatā, ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi sa-upaniso iti pi
saparikkhāro iti pi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1023-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1023">12</a></sup></p>
<p>What, monks, is noble right concentration with its supports and requisites?
That is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort and right mindfulness – that unification of mind
equipped with these seven factors is called noble right concentration with its
supports and requisites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So right concentration itself is the path. The singular number is used to denote
the fact that it is accompanied by the requisite factors. Otherwise the plural
<em>maggaṅgā</em>, factors of the path, could have been used to name this category. The
unitary notion has a significance of its own. It is suggestive of the fact that
here we have a unification of all the forces built up by the participative
factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p>In this discourse, the Buddha comes out with an explanation of certain other
important aspects of this noble eightfold path. The fact that right view takes
precedence is emphatically stated several times,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tatra, bhikkhave, sammā diṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā</em>,</p>
<p>therein, monks, right view leads the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also noteworthy that right view is declared as twofold,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sammā diṭṭhiṁ pahaṁ dvayaṁ vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>Even right view, I say, is twofold.</p>
<p><em>Atthi, bhikkhave, sammā diṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā, atthi,
bhikkhave, sammā diṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.</em></p>
<p>There is right view, monks, that is affected by influxes, on the side of merit
and maturing into assets, and there is right view, monks, that is noble,
influx-free, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first type of right view, which is affected by influxes, on the side of
merit and ripening in assets, is the one often met with in general in the
analysis of the noble eightfold path, namely the ten-factored right view. It is
known as the right view which takes <em>kamma</em> as one’s own, <em>kammassakatā sammā
diṭṭhi</em>. The standard definition of it runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atthi dinnaṁ, atthi yiṭṭhaṁ, atthi hutaṁ, atthi sukaṭadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ
phalaṁ vipāko, atthi ayaṁ loko, atthi paro loko, atthi mātā, atthi pitā, atthi
sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca
lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedenti.</em></p>
<p>There is [an effectiveness] in what is given, what is offered and what is
sacrificed, there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds, there is this
world and the other world, there is mother and father, there are beings who
are reborn spontaneously, there are in the world rightly treading and rightly
practising recluses and Brahmins who have realized by themselves by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This right view is still with influxes, it is on the side of merits and is
productive of <em>saṁsāric</em> assets. About this right view, this discourse has very
little to say. In this sutta, the greater attention is focussed on that right
view which is noble, influx-free, supramundane, and constitutes a factor of the
path. It is explained as the right view that comes up at the supramundane path
moment. It is noble, <em>ariyā</em>, influx-free, <em>anāsavā</em>, and conducive to
transcendence of the world, <em>lokuttarā</em>. It is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino
ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato paññā paññindriyaṁ paññābalaṁ dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo
sammādiṭṭhi maggaṅgā, ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā
maggaṅgā.</em></p>
<p>Monks that wisdom, that faculty of wisdom, that power of wisdom, that
investigation of states enlightenment factor, that path factor of right view
in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is influx-free, who has the noble path
and is developing the noble path, that is the right view which is noble,
influx-free and supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these synonymous terms are indicative of that wisdom directed towards
Nibbāna in that noble disciple. They are representative of the element of wisdom
maintained from the faculty stage upwards in his systematic development of the
enlightenment factors.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that, in connection with the supramundane aspect of the
path factors, four significant qualifying terms are always cited, as, for
instance, in the following reference to right view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sammādiṭṭhiṁ bhāveti vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ
nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1024-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1024">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Herein, monks, a monk develops right view which is based upon seclusion,
dispassion and cessation, maturing in release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the higher grade of right view, which aims at Nibbāna. It implies the
wisdom of the four noble truths, that noble wisdom which sees the rise and fall,
<em>udayatthagāminī paññā</em>.</p>
<p>The line of synonymous terms quoted above clearly indicates that the noble
eightfold path contains, within it, all the faculties, powers and enlightenment
factors so far developed. This is not a mere citation of apparent synonyms for
an academic purpose. It brings out the fact that at the path moment the essence
of all the wisdom that systematically got developed through the five faculties,
the five powers and the seven enlightenment factors surfaces in the noble
disciple to effect the final breakthrough.</p>
<p>The two-fold definition given by the Buddha is common to the first five factors
of the path: right view, right thought, right speech, right action and right
livelihood. That is to say, all these factors have an aspect that can be called
‘tinged with influxes’, <em>sa-āsava</em>, ‘on the side of merit’, <em>puññabhāgiya</em>, and
‘productive of <em>saṁsāric</em> assets’, <em>upadhivepakka</em>, as well as an aspect that
deserves to be called ‘noble’, <em>ariya</em>, ‘influx-free’, <em>anāsava</em>,
‘supramundane’, <em>lokuttara</em>, ‘a constituent factor of the path’, <em>maggaṅga</em>.</p>
<p>The usual definition of the noble eightfold path is well known. A question might
arise as to the part played by right speech, right action and right livelihood
at the arising of the supramundane path. Their role at the path moment is
described as an abstinence from the four kinds of verbal misconduct, an
abstinence from the three kinds of bodily misconduct, and an abstinence from
wrong livelihood.</p>
<p>The element of abstinence therein implied is conveyed by such terms as <em>ārati
virati paṭivirati veramaṇī</em>, “desisting from, abstaining, refraining,
abstinence”. It is the very thought of abstaining that represents the three
factors at the path moment and not their physical counterparts. That is to say,
the act of refraining has already been accomplished.</p>
<p>So then we are concerned only with the other five factors of the path. Out of
them, three factors are highlighted as running around and circling around each
of these five for the purpose of their fulfilment, namely right view, right
effort and right mindfulness. This running around and circling around, conveyed
by the two terms <em>anuparidhāvanti</em> and <em>anuparivattanti</em>, is extremely peculiar
in this context.</p>
<p>The role of these three states might be difficult for one to understand.
Perhaps, as an illustration, we may take the case of a VIP, a very important
person, being conducted through a crowd with much pomp. One ushers him in with
his vanguard, another brings up the rear with his bandwagon while yet another is
at hand as the bodyguard-cum-attendant. So also at the path moment right view
shows the way, right effort gives the boost, while right mindfulness attends at
hand.</p>
<p>These security forces keep the wrong side, <em>micchā</em>, of the path factors in
check. The precedence of right view is a salient feature of the noble eightfold
path. The Buddha makes special mention of it, pointing out at the same time the
inner consistency of its internal arrangement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tatra, bhikkhave, sammā diṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammā
diṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? Sammā diṭṭhissa, bhikkhave, sammā saṅkappo pahoti,
sammā saṅkappassa sammā vācā pahoti, sammā vācassa sammā kammanto pahoti,
sammā kammantassa sammā ājīvo pahoti, sammā ājīvassa sammā vāyāmo pahoti,
sammā vāyāmassa sammā sati pahoti, sammā satissa sammā samādhi pahoti, sammā
samādhissa sammā ñāṇam pahoti, sammā ñāṇassa sammā vimutti pahoti. Iti kho,
bhikkhave, aṭṭhaṅgasamannāgato sekho pāṭipado, dasaṅgasamannāgato arahā
hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1025-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1025">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Therein, monks, right view comes first. And how, monks, does right view come
first? In one of right view, right intention arises. In one of right
intention, right speech arises. In one of right speech, right action arises.
In one of right action, right livelihood arises. In one of right livelihood,
right effort arises. In one of right effort, right mindfulness arises. In one
of right mindfulness, right concentration arises. In one of right
concentration, right knowledge arises. In one of right knowledge, right
deliverance arises. Thus, monks, the disciple in higher training possessed of
eight factors becomes an <em>arahant</em> when possessed of the ten factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fundamental importance of right view as the forerunner is highlighted by the
Buddha in some discourses. In a particular discourse in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>,
it is contrasted with the negative role of wrong view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Micchādiṭṭhikassa, bhikkhave, purisapuggalassa yañceva kāyakammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi
samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yañca vacīkammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yañca
manokammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yā ca cetanā yā ca patthanā yo ca
paṇidhi ye ca saṅkhārā sabbe te dhammā aniṭṭhaya akantāya amanāpāya ahitāya
dukkhāya saṁvattanti. Taṁ kissa hetu? Diṭṭhi hi, bhikkhave, pāpikā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1026-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1026">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, in the case of a person with wrong view, whatever bodily deed he does
accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever verbal deed he
does accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever mental deed
he does accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever intention,
whatever aspiration, whatever determination, whatever preparations he makes,
all those mental states conduce to unwelcome, unpleasant, unwholesome,
disagreeable and painful consequences. Why is that? The view, monks, is evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the evil nature of the view, all what follows from it partakes of an evil
character. Then he gives an illustration for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, nimbabījaṁ vā kosātakībījaṁ vā tittakalābubījaṁ vā
allāya paṭhaviyā nikkhittaṁ yañceva paṭhavirasaṁ upādiyati yañca āporasaṁ
upādiyati sabbaṁ taṁ tittakattāya kaṭukattāya asātattāya saṁvattati. Taṁ kissa
hetu? Bījaṁ hi, bhikkhave, pāpakaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Just as, monks, in the case of a margosa seed or a bitter gourd seed, or a
long gourd seed thrown on wet ground, whatever taste of the earth it draws in,
whatever taste of the water it draws in, all that conduces to bitterness, to
sourness, to unpleasantness. Why is that? The seed, monks, is bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he makes a similar statement with regard to right view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sammādiṭṭhikassa, bhikkhave, purisapuggalassa yañceva kāyakammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi
samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yañca vacīkammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yañca
manokammaṁ yathādiṭṭhi samattaṁ samādinnaṁ yā ca cetanā yā ca patthanā yo ca
paṇidhi ye ca saṅkhārā sabbe te dhammā iṭṭhaya kantāya manāpāya hitāya sukhāya
saṁvattanti. Taṁ kissa hetu? Diṭṭhi hi, bhikkhave, bhaddikā.</em></p>
<p>Monks, in the case of a person with right view, whatever bodily deed he does
accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever verbal deed he
does accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever mental deed
he does accords with the view he has grasped and taken up, whatever intention,
whatever aspiration, whatever determination, whatever preparations he makes,
all those mental states conduce to welcome, pleasant, wholesome, agreeable and
happy consequences. Why is that? The view, monks, is good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the illustration for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ucchubījaṁ vā sālibījaṁ vā muddikābījaṁ vā allāya
paṭhaviyā nikkhittaṁ yañceva paṭhavirasaṁ upādiyati yañca āporasaṁ upādiyati
sabbaṁ taṁ madhurattāya sātattāya asecanakattāya saṁvattati. Taṁ kissa hetu?
Bījaṁ hi, bhikkhave, bhaddakaṁ.</em></p>
<p>Just as, monks, in the case of a sugar cane seedling or a sweet paddy seed, or
a grape seed thrown on wet ground, whatever taste of the earth it draws in,
whatever taste of the water it draws in, all that conduces to sweetness,
agreeableness and deliciousness. Why is that? The seed, monks, is excellent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains why the noble eightfold path begins with right view. This
precedence of view is not to be found in the other groups of participative
factors of enlightenment. The reason for this peculiarity is the fact that view
has to come first in any total transformation of personality in an individual
from a psychological point of view.</p>
<p>A view gives rise to thoughts, thoughts issue in words, words lead to actions,
and actions mould a livelihood. Livelihood forms the basis for the development
of other virtues on the side of meditation, namely right effort, right
mindfulness and right concentration. So we find the precedence of right view as
a unique feature in the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>The fundamental importance of the noble eightfold path could be assessed from
another point of view. It gains a high degree of recognition due to the fact
that the Buddha has styled it as the middle path. For instance, in the
<em>Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</em>, the discourse on the turning of the wheel, the
middle path is explicitly defined as the noble eightfold path. It is
sufficiently well known that the noble eightfold path has been called the middle
path by the Buddha. But the basic idea behind this definition has not always
been correctly understood.</p>
<p>In the <em>Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</em> the Buddha has presented the noble eightfold
path as a middle path between the two extremes called <em>kāmasukhallikānuyogo</em>,
the pursuit of sensual pleasure, and <em>attakilamathānuyogo</em>, the pursuit of
self-mortification.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1027-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1027">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The concept of a ‘middle’ might make one think that the noble eightfold path is
made up by borrowing fifty per cent from each of the two extremes, the pursuit
of sense pleasures and the pursuit of self-mortification. But it is not such a
piecemeal solution. There are deeper implications involved.</p>
<p>The <em>Mahācattārīsakasutta</em> in particular brings out the true depth of this
middle path. Instead of grafting half of one extreme to half of the other, the
Buddha rejected the wrong views behind both those pursuits and, avoiding the
pitfalls of both, presented anew a middle path in the form of the noble
eightfold path.</p>
<p>By way of clarification, we may draw attention to the fact that one inclines to
the pursuit of sense pleasures by taking one’s stance on the annihilationist
view. It amounts to the idea that there is no rebirth and that one can indulge
in sense pleasures unhindered by ethical considerations of good and evil. It
inculcates a nihilistic outlook characterized by a long line of negatives.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to it, we have the affirmative standpoint forming the lower
grade of the right view referred to above, namely the right view which takes
<em>kamma</em> as one’s own, <em>kammasakatā sammā diṭṭhi</em>. The positive outlook in this
right view inculcates moral responsibility and forms the basis for skilful or
meritorious deeds. That is why it is called <em>puññabhāgiya,</em> on the side of
merits. By implication, the nihilistic outlook, on the other hand, is on the
side of demerit, lacking a basis for skilful action.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the law of dependent arising, also, we happened to mention
the idea of a middle path. But that is from the philosophical standpoint. Here
we are concerned with the ethical aspect of the middle path. As far as the
ethical requirements are concerned, a nihilistic view by itself does not entitle
one to deliverance. Why? Because the question of influxes is there to cope with.</p>
<p>So long as the influxes of sensuality, <em>kāmāsavā</em>, of becoming, <em>bhavāsavā</em>, and
of ignorance, <em>avijjāsavā</em>, are there, one cannot escape the consequences of
action merely by virtue of a nihilistic view. That is why the Buddha took a
positive stand on those ten postulates. Where the nihilist found an excuse for
indulgence in sensuality by negating, the Buddha applied a corrective by
asserting. This affirmative stance took care of one extremist trend.</p>
<p>But the Buddha did not stop there. In the description of the higher grade of
right view we came across the terms <em>ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā</em>. In the
case of the lower grade it is <em>sa-āsavā</em>, with influxes, here it is <em>anāsavā</em>,
influx-free. At whatever moment the mind develops that strength to withstand the
influxes, one is not carried away by worldly conventions. That is why the right
view at the supramundane path moment is called influx-free.</p>
<p>There is an extremely subtle point involved in this distinction. This noble
influx-free right view, that is a constituent of the supramundane path, <em>ariyā
anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā</em>, is oriented towards cessation, <em>nirodha</em>. The right
view that takes <em>kamma</em> as one’s own, <em>kammasakatā sammā diṭṭhi</em>, on the other
hand is oriented towards arising, <em>samudaya</em>.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the right view at the path moment is oriented towards
cessation we find it qualified with the terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ</em>,</p>
<p>based upon seclusion, dispassion and cessation, maturing in release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this orientation towards Nibbāna that paves the way for the signless,
<em>animitta</em>, the undirected, <em>appaṇihita</em>, and the void, <em>suññata</em>. We have
already discussed at length about them in our previous sermons.</p>
<p>Perhaps, while listening to them, some might have got scared at the thought: “So
then there is not even a mother or a father”. That is why the word <em>suññatā</em>,
voidness, drives terror into those who do not understand it properly. Here we
see the depth of the Buddha’s middle path. That right view with influxes,
<em>sa-āsavā</em>, is on the side of merits, <em>puññabhāgiya</em>, not demerit, <em>apuñña</em>.</p>
<p>If the Buddha sanctions demerit, he could have endorsed the nihilistic view that
there is no this world or the other world, no mother or father. But due to the
norm of <em>kamma</em> which he explained in such terms as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>kammassakā sattā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1028-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1028">17</a></sup></p>
<p>beings have <em>kamma</em> as their own, they are inheritors of <em>kamma</em>, <em>kamma</em> is
their matrix, <em>kamma</em> is their relative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So long as ignorance and craving are there, beings take their stand on
convention and go on accumulating <em>kamma</em>. They have to pay for it. They have to
suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Though with influxes, <em>sa-āsava</em>, that right view is on the side of merit,
<em>puññabhāgiya</em>, which mature into <em>saṁsāric</em> assets, <em>upadhivepakka</em>, in the
form of the conditions in life conducive even to the attainment of Nibbāna. That
kind of right view is preferable to the nihilistic view, although it is of a
second grade.</p>
<p>But then there is the other side of the <em>saṁsāric</em> problem. One cannot afford to
stagnate there. There should be a release from it as a permanent solution. That
is where the higher grade of right view comes in, the noble influx-free right
view which occurs as a factor of the path. It is then that the terms <em>animitta</em>,
signless, <em>appaṇihita</em>, the undirected and <em>suññata</em>, the void, become
meaningful.</p>
<p>When the mind is weaned away from the habit of grasping signs, from determining
and from the notion of self-hood, the three doorways to deliverance, the
signless, the undirected and the void, would open up for an exit from this
<em>saṁsāric</em> cycle. The cessation of existence is Nibbāna, <em>bhavanirodho
nibbānaṁ</em>. Here, then, we have the reason why the noble eightfold path is called
the middle path.</p>
<p>In the life of a meditator, also, the concept of a middle path could sometimes
give rise to doubts and indecision. One might wonder whether one should strive
hard or lead a comfortable life. A midway solution between the two might be
taken as the middle path. But the true depth of the middle path emerges from the
above analysis of the twofold definition of the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>It is because of this depth of the middle path that the Buddha made the
following declaration in the <em>Aggappasādasutta</em> of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yāvatā, bhikkhave, dhammā saṅkhatā, ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo tesaṁ aggam
akkhāyati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1029-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1029">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatever prepared things there are, the noble eightfold path is called
the highest among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that the noble eightfold path is something prepared and that is why
we showed its relation to causes and conditions. Whatever is prepared is not
worthwhile, and yet, it is by means of this prepared noble eightfold path that
the Buddha clears the path to the unprepared.</p>
<p>This is an extremely subtle truth, which only a Buddha can discover and proclaim
to the world. It is not easy to discover it, because one tends to confuse issues
by going to one extreme or another. One either resorts to the annihilationist
view and ends up by giving way to indulgence in sensuality, or inclines towards
the eternalist view and struggles to extricate self by self-mortification.</p>
<p>In the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha one can see a marvellous middle way. We
have already pointed it out in earlier sermons by means of such illustrations as
sharpening a razor. There is a remarkable attitude of non-grasping about the
middle path, which is well expressed by the term <em>atammayatā</em>,
non-identification. Relying on one thing is just for the purpose of eliminating
another, as exemplified by the simile of the relay of chariots.</p>
<p>The key terms signifying the aim and purpose of this middle path are</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ</em>,</p>
<p>based upon seclusion, dispassion and cessation, maturing in release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placed in this <em>saṁsāric</em> predicament, one cannot help resorting to certain
things to achieve this aim. But care is taken to see that they are not grasped
or clung to. It is a process of pushing away one thing with another, and that
with yet another, a via media based on relativity and pragmatism. The noble
eightfold path marks the consummation of this process, its systematic
fulfilment. That is why we tried to trace a process of a gradual development
among the thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Even the internal arrangement within each group is extraordinary. There is an
orderly arrangement from beginning to end in an ascending order of importance.
Sometimes, an analysis could start from the middle and extend to either side.
Some groups portray a gradual development towards a climax. The noble eightfold
path is exceptionally striking in that it indicates how a complete
transformation of personality could be effected by putting right view at the
head as the forerunner.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive among discourses in which the Buddha highlighted the
pervasive significance of the noble eightfold path is the <em>Ākāsasutta</em>, ‘Sky
Sutta’, in the <em>Magga Saṁyutta</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1030-1"><a href="sermon-32.html#fn-fn1030">19</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as, monks, various winds blow in the sky, easterly winds, westerly winds,
northerly winds, southerly winds, dusty winds, dustless winds, cold winds and
hot winds, gentle winds and strong winds; so too, when a monk develops and
cultivates the noble eightfold path, for him the four foundations of
mindfulness go to fulfilment by development, the four right efforts go to
fulfilment by development, the four bases for success go to fulfilment by
development, the five spiritual faculties go to fulfilment by development, the
five powers go to fulfilment by development, the seven factors of
enlightenment go to fulfilment by development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these go to fulfilment by development only when the noble eightfold path is
developed in the way described above, namely based upon seclusion, dispassion
and cessation, maturing in release, <em>vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ
nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ</em>.</p>
<p>That is to say, with Nibbāna as the goal of endeavour. Then none of the
preceding categories go astray. They all contribute to the perfection and
fulfilment of the noble eightfold path. They are all enshrined in it. So well
knitted and pervasive is the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>Another discourse of paramount importance, which illustrates the pervasive
influence of the noble eightfold path, is the <em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> of the
<em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. There the Buddha shows us how all the other enlightenment
factors are included in the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>In our discussion on Nibbāna, we happened to mention that the cessation of the
six sense-spheres is Nibbāna. If Nibbāna is the cessation of the six
sense-spheres, it should be possible to lay down a way of practice leading to
Nibbāna through the six sense-spheres themselves. As a matter of fact, there is
such a way of practice and this is what the <em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> presents in
summary form.</p>
<p>In this discourse, the Buddha first portrays how on the one hand the <em>saṁsāric</em>
suffering arises depending on the six-fold sense-sphere. Then he explains how on
the other hand the suffering could be ended by means of a practice pertaining to
the six-fold sense-sphere itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuṁ, bhikkhave, ajānaṁ apassaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, rūpe ajānaṁ apassaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhuviññāṇaṁ ajānaṁ apassaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhusamphassaṁ

<p>Monks, not knowing and not seeing the eye as it actually is, not knowing and
not seeing forms as they actually are, not knowing and not seeing
eye-consciousness as it actually is, not knowing and not seeing eye-contact as
it actually is, whatever is felt as pleasant or unpleasant or
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising dependent on eye-contact, not knowing
and not seeing that too as it actually is, one gets lustfully attached to the
eye, to forms, to eye-consciousness, to eye-contact, and to whatever is felt
as pleasant or unpleasant or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising in
dependence on eye-contact.</p>
<p>And for him, who is lustfully attached, fettered, infatuated, contemplating
gratification, the five aggregates of grasping get accumulated for the future
and his craving, which makes for re-becoming, which is accompanied by delight
and lust, delighting now here now there, also increases, his bodily stresses
increase, his mental stresses increase, his bodily torments increase, his
mental torments increase, his bodily fevers increase, his mental fevers
increase, and he experiences bodily and mental suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, the Buddha first of all delineates how the entire <em>saṁsāric</em>
suffering arises in connection with the six-fold sense-sphere. We will discuss
the rest of the discourse in our next sermon.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the assembly of the venerable meditative monks. This is
the thirty-third sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our last sermon, the other day, we happened to mention that
in developing the noble eightfold path fully intent on Nibbāna, all the other
enlightenment factors, namely the four foundations of mindfulness, the four
right endeavours, the four bases for success, the five spiritual faculties, the
five powers and the seven factors of enlightenment go to fulfilment by
development.</p>
<p>Though we started analyzing the way in which the Buddha clarified the
above-mentioned peculiarity of the noble eightfold path in the
<em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, we could not finish it.</p>
<p>From the sutta passage we quoted the other day, we could see how the lack of
knowledge of things as they are in regard to the six-fold sense-sphere gives
rise to attachments, entanglements and delusions. As a result of it, the five
aggregates of grasping get accumulated, leading to an increase in craving that
makes for re-becoming, as well as an increase in bodily stresses and torment,
mental stresses and torment, bodily fevers and mental fevers, and bodily and
mental suffering.</p>
<p>Today, to begin with, let us discuss the rest of that discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñca kho, bhikkhave, jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, rūpe jānaṁ passaṁ
yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhuviññāṇaṁ jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ, cakkhusamphassaṁ jānaṁ

sārajjati, yampidaṁ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṁ sukhaṁ vā
dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā tasmimpi na sārajjati.</em></p>
<p><em>Tassa asārattassa asaṁyuttasa asammūḷhassa ādīnavānupassino viharato āyatiṁ
pañcupādānakkhandhā apacayaṁ gacchanti. Taṇhā cassa ponobhavikā
nandirāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī sā cassa pahīyati. Tassa kāyikāpi
darathā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi darathā pahīyanti, kāyikāpi santāpā pahīyanti,
cetasikāpi santāpā pahīyanti, kāyikāpi pariḷāhā pahīyanti, cetasikāpi pariḷāhā
pahīyanti. So kāyasukhampi cetosukhampi paṭisaṁvedeti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1033-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1033">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, knowing and seeing the eye as it actually is, knowing and seeing forms
as they actually are, knowing and seeing eye-consciousness as it actually is,
knowing and seeing eye-contact as it actually is, whatever is felt, pleasant
or unpleasant or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising in dependence on
eye-contact, knowing and seeing that too as it actually is, one does not get
lustfully attached to the eye, to forms, to eye-consciousness, to eye-contact,
and to whatever is felt as pleasant or unpleasant or
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, arising in dependence on eye-contact.</p>
<p>And for him, who is not lustfully attached, not fettered, not infatuated,
contemplating danger, the five aggregates of grasping get diminished for the
future and his craving, which makes for re-becoming, which is accompanied by
delight and lust, delighting now here now there, is abandoned, his bodily
stresses are abandoned, his mental stresses are abandoned, his bodily torments
are abandoned, his mental torments are abandoned, his bodily fevers are
abandoned, his mental fevers are abandoned, and he experiences bodily and
mental happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha goes on to point out how the noble eightfold path gets developed
in this noble disciple by this training in regard to the six spheres of sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā tathābhūtassa diṭṭhi sāssa hoti sammā diṭṭhi, yo tathābhūtassa saṅkappo
svāssa hoti sammā saṅkappo, yo tathābhūtassa vāyāmo svāssa hoti sammā vāyāmo,
yā tathābhūtassa sati sāssa hoti sammā sati, yo tathābhūtassa samādhi svāssa
hoti sammā samādhi, Pubbeva kho panassa kāyakammaṁ vacīkammaṁ ājīvo
suparisuddho hoti. Evamassāyaṁ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvanāpāripūriṁ
gacchati.</em></p>
<p>The view of a person such as this is right view. The intention of a person
such as this is right intention. The effort of a person such as this is right
effort. The mindfulness of a person such as this is right mindfulness. The
concentration of a person such as this is right concentration. But his bodily
action, his verbal action and his livelihood have already been purified
earlier. Thus this noble eightfold path comes to fulfilment in him by
development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that in this context the usual order in citing the factors of
the path is not found. But at the end we are told that bodily action, verbal
action and livelihood have already been purified.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the explanation given in the <em>Mahācattārīsakasutta</em>, in
the previous sermon. That is to say, when the noble eightfold path is perfected
at the supramundane level, the three factors right speech, right action and
right livelihood are represented by the very thought of abstaining.</p>
<p>Now the Buddha proclaims how all the enlightenment factors reach fulfilment by
development when one develops the noble eightfold path in this way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tassa evaṁ imaṁ ariyaṁ aṭṭhaṅgikaṁ maggaṁ bhāvayato cattāropi satipaṭṭhānā
bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, cattāropi sammappadhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ
gacchanti, cattāropi iddhipādā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, pañcapi indriyāni
bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, pañcapi balāni bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti, sattapi
bojjhaṅgā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti. Tass’ime dve dhammā yuganaddhā vattanti,
samatho ca vipassanā ca.</em></p>
<p>When he develops this noble eightfold path in this way, the four foundations
of mindfulness also come to fulfilment by development, the four right
endeavours also come to fulfilment by development, the four bases for success
also come to fulfilment by development, the five faculties also come to
fulfilment by development, the five powers also come to fulfilment by
development and the seven factors of enlightenment also come to fulfilment by
development. These two things, namely serenity and insight, occur in him yoked
evenly together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The net result of perfecting all the enlightenment factors is summed up by the
Buddha in the following declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So ye dhammā abhiññā pariññeyyā te dhamme abhiññā parijānāti, ye dhammā
abhiññā pahātabbā te dhamme abhiññā pajahati, ye dhammā abhiññā bhāvetabbā te
dhamme abhiññā bhāveti, ye dhammā abhiññā sacchikātabbā te dhamme abhiññā
sacchikaroti.</em></p>
<p>He comprehends by direct knowledge those things that should be comprehended by
direct knowledge, he abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be
abandoned by direct knowledge, he develops by direct knowledge those things
that should be developed by direct knowledge, he realizes by direct knowledge
those things that should be realized by direct knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The things that should be comprehended by direct knowledge are explained in the
sutta itself as the five aggregates of grasping. The things that should be
abandoned by direct knowledge are ignorance and craving. The things that should
be developed by direct knowledge are serenity and insight. The things that
should be realized by direct knowledge are true knowledge and deliverance.</p>
<p>So then, as we have already mentioned, the orderly arrangement in these
thirty-seven enlightenment factors is well illustrated in this discourse. It is
because of this orderliness that even in a stream-winner, who is well
established in the noble eightfold path, other enlightenment factors are said to
be present as if automatically.</p>
<p>Simply because the phrase <em>ekāyano ayaṁ, bhikkhave, maggo</em> occurs in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, some are tempted to interpret the four foundations of
mindfulness as ‘the only way’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1034-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1034">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We have pointed out, with valid reasons on an earlier occasion, that such a
conclusion is unwarranted. <em>Ekāyano</em> does not mean ‘the only way’, it means
‘directed to one particular destination’, that is, to Nibbāna. That is why the
following words occur later on in the same sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ñāyassa adhigamāya Nibbānassa sacchikiriyāya</em>,</p>
<p>for the attainment of the supramundane path, for the realizing of Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four foundations of mindfulness are the preliminary training for the
attainment of the supramundane path and realization of Nibbāna. The initial
start made by the four foundations of mindfulness is carried over by the four
right endeavours, the four bases for success, the five faculties, the five
powers and the seven enlightenment factors, to reach the acme of perfection in
the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mahāsaḷāyatanikasutta</em> we came across the repetitive phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>jānaṁ passaṁ yathābhūtaṁ</em></p>
<p>knowing and seeing as it actually is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used in connection with the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact and
whatever is felt due to eye-contact. Let us examine what this knowing and seeing
as it actually is amounts to.</p>
<p>Perception has been compared to a mirage.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1035-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1035">4</a></sup> This mirage nature of
perception has to be understood. A deer which sees a mirage in a plain from a
distance in the dry season has a perception of water in it. In other words, it
imagines water in the mirage. Impelled by that imagining, it runs towards the
mirage with the idea that by running it can do away with the gap between itself
and the water, and reach that water.</p>
<p>But there is something that the deer is not aware of, and that is that this gap
can never be reduced by running.</p>
<p>So long as there are two ends, there is a middle. This is a maxim worth
emphasizing. Where there are two ends, there is a middle. If the eye is
distinguished as one end and what appears in the distance is distinguished as
water, there is an intervening space, a gap between the two. All these three
factors are integral in this perceptual situation. That is why the gap can never
be done away with.</p>
<p>The emancipated one, who has understood that this can never be eliminated, does
not run after the mirage. That one with discernment, that <em>arahant</em>, stops short
at the seen, true to the aphorism <em>diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ</em>, “in the seen just the
seen”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1036-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1036">5</a></sup></p>
<p>He stops at the heard in the heard, he stops at the sensed in the sensed, he
stops at the cognized in the cognized. He does not go on imagining like that
deer, taking his stand on perception. He does not imagine a thing seen or one
who sees. Nor does he entertain imaginings in regard to the heard, the sensed
and the cognized.</p>
<p>The fact that this freedom from imaginings is there in an <em>arahant</em> is clear
from the statement we quoted from the <em>Chabbisodhanasutta</em> on an earlier
occasion. According to that discourse, a monk rightly claiming <em>arahanthood</em>,
one who declares himself to be an <em>arahant</em>, should be able to make the
following statement in respect of the seen, the heard, the sensed and the
cognized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhe kho ahaṁ, āvuso, anupāyo anapāyo anissito appaṭibaddho vippamutto
visaṁyutto vimariyādikatena cetasā viharāmi.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1037-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1037">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Friends, with regard to the seen, I dwell unattracted, unrepelled,
independent, uninvolved, released, unshackled, with a mind free from barriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let us try to understand this statement in the light of what we have already
said about the mirage. One can neither approach nor retreat from a mirage.
Generally, when one sees a mirage in the dry season, one imagines a perception
of water in it and runs towards it due to thirst.</p>
<p>But let us, for a moment, think that on seeing the mirage one becomes
apprehensive of a flood and turns and runs away to escape it. Having run some
far, if he looks back he will still see the mirage behind him.</p>
<p>So in the case of a mirage, the more one approaches it, the farther it recedes,
the more one recedes from it, the nearer it appears. So in regard to the mirage
of percepts, such as the seen and the heard, the <em>arahant</em> neither approaches
nor recedes. Mentally he neither approaches nor recedes, though he may appear to
do both physically, from the point of view of the worldling – <em>anupāyo anapāyo</em>,
unattracted, unrepelled.</p>
<p>It is the same with regard to the term <em>anissito</em>, independent. He does not
resort to the mirage with the thought “Ah, here is a good reservoir”.</p>
<p><em>Appaṭibaddho</em>, uninvolved, he is not mentally involved in the mirage.</p>
<p><em>Vippamutto</em>, released, he is released from the perception of water in the
mirage, from imagining water in it.</p>
<p><em>Visaṁyutto,</em> unshackled, he is not bound by it.</p>
<p><em>Vimariyādikatena cetasā</em>, with a mind free from barriers. What are these
barriers? The two ends and the middle. The demarcation mentioned above by
distinguishing eye as distinct from form, with the intervening space or the gap
as the ‘tertium quid’. So for the <em>arahant</em> there are no barriers by taking the
eye, the forms and the gap as discrete.</p>
<p>Now from what we have already discussed, it should be clear that by <em>maññanā</em> or
imagining a thing-hood is attributed to the seen, the heard, the sensed and the
cognized. One imagines a thing in the seen, heard etc. By that very imagining as
a thing it becomes another thing, true to the dictum expressed in the line of
that verse from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> we had quoted earlier,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yena yena hi maññanti, tato taṁ hoti aññāthā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1038-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1038">7</a></sup></p>
<p>in whatever egoistic terms they imagine, thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why we earlier said that a thing has to be there first for it to become
another thing, for there to be an otherwiseness. The more one tries to approach
the thing imagined, the more it recedes.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>, we discussed at length about the
three levels of knowledge mentioned there, namely <em>saññā, abhiññā</em> and
<em>pariññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1039-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1039">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The untaught worldling is bound by sense-perception and goes on imagining
according to it. Perceiving earth in the earth element, he imagines ‘earth’ as a
thing, he imagines ‘in the earth’, ‘earth is mine’, ‘from the earth’ etc. So
also with regard to the seen, <em>diṭṭha</em>.</p>
<p>But the disciple in training, <em>sekha</em>, since he has a higher knowledge of
conditionality, although he has not exhausted the influxes and latencies, trains
in resisting from the tendency to imagine. An emancipated one, the <em>arahant</em>,
has fully comprehended the mirage nature of perception.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that these forms of <em>maññanā</em> enable one to imagine things,
attributing a notion of substantiality to sense data. In fact, what we have here
is only a heap of imaginings. There is also an attempt to hold on to things
imagined. Craving lends a hand to it, and so there is grasping, <em>upādāna</em>.
Thereby the fact that there are three conditions is ignored or forgotten.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> we came across a highly significant
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1040-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1040">9</a></sup></p>
<p>dependent on the eye and forms, friends, arises eye-consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deepest point in sense perception is already implicit there. This statement
clearly indicates that eye-consciousness is dependently arisen. Thereby we are
confronted with the question of the two ends and the middle, discussed above.</p>
<p>In fact, what is called eye-consciousness is the very discrimination between eye
and form. At whatever moment the eye is distinguished as the internal sphere and
form is distinguished as the external sphere, it is then that eye-consciousness
arises. That itself is the gap in the middle, the intervening space. Here, then,
we have the two ends and the middle.</p>
<p>To facilitate understanding this situation, let us hark back to the simile of
the carpenter we brought up in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1041-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1041">10</a></sup></p>
<p>We mentioned that a carpenter, fixing up a door by joining two planks, might
speak of the contact between the two planks when his attention is turned to the
intervening space, to see how well one plank touches the other. The concept of
touching between the two planks came up because the carpenter’s attention picked
up the two planks as separate and not as one board.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is implicit in the statement <em>cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca
uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ</em>, “dependent on eye and forms arises
eye-consciousness”. In this perceptual situation, the eye is distinguished from
forms. That discrimination itself is consciousness. That is the gap or the
interstice, the middle. So here we have the two ends and the middle.</p>
<p>Eye-contact, from the point of view of Dhamma, is an extremely complex
situation. As a matter of fact, it is something that has two ends and a middle.
The two ends and the middle belong to it. However, there is a tendency in the
world to ignore this middle.</p>
<p>The attempt to tie up the two ends by ignoring the middle is <em>upādāna</em> or
grasping. That is impelled by craving, <em>taṇhā</em>. Due to craving, grasping occurs
as a matter of course. It is as if the deer, thinking “I am here and the water
is there, so let me get closer”, starts running towards it. The gap is ignored.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens in the case of sense perception. What impels one to
ignore that gap is craving. It is sometimes called <em>lepa</em> or glue. With that
agglutinative quality in craving the gap is continually sought to be glued up
and ignored.</p>
<p>The Buddha has compared craving to a seamstress. The verb <em>sibbati</em> or
<em>saṁsibbati</em> is used to convey the idea of sewing and weaving both. In sewing as
well as in weaving, there is an attempt to reduce a gap by stitching up or
knitting up. What is called <em>upādāna</em>, grasping or holding on, is an attempt to
tie up two ends with the help of <em>taṇhā</em>, craving or thirst.</p>
<p>In the <em>Tissametteyyasutta</em> of the <em>Pārāyaṇavagga</em> in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, the
Buddha shows how one can bypass this seamstress or weaver that is craving and
attain emancipation in the following extremely deep verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo ubh’ anta-m-abhiññāya</em> <br />
<em>majjhe mantā na lippati,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ brūmi mahāpuriso’ti</em> <br />
<em>so ’dha sibbanim accagā.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1042-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1042">11</a></sup></p>
<p>He who, having known both ends, <br />
With wisdom does not get attached to the middle, <br />
Him I call a great man, <br />
He has gone beyond the seamstress in this [world].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse is so deep and meaningful that already during the lifetime of the
Buddha, when he was dwelling at Isipatana in Benares, a group of Elder Monks
gathered at the assembly hall and held a symposium on the meaning of this verse.</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time, unlike today, for deep discussions on Dhamma, they took up
such deep topics as found in the <em>Aṭṭhakavagga</em> and <em>Pārāyaṇavagga</em> of the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. In this case, the topic that came up for discussion, as recorded
among the Sixes in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamo nu kho, āvuso, eko anto, katamo dutiyo anto, kiṁ majjhe, kā
sibbani?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1043-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1043">12</a></sup></p>
<p>What, friends, is the one end, what is the second end, what is in the middle
and who is the seamstress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first venerable Thera, who addressed the assembly of monks on this topic,
offered the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contact, friends, is one end, arising of contact is the second end, cessation
of contact is in the middle, craving is the seamstress, for it is craving that
stitches up for the birth of this and that specific existence.</p>
<p>In so far, friends, does a monk understand by higher knowledge what is to be
understood by higher knowledge, comprehend by full understanding what is to be
comprehended by full understanding. Understanding by higher knowledge what is
to be understood by higher knowledge, comprehending by full understanding what
is to be comprehended by full understanding, he becomes an ender of suffering
in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craving, according to this interpretation, is a seamstress, because it is
craving that puts the stitch for existence.</p>
<p>Then a second venerable Thera puts forth his opinion. According to his point of
view, the past is one end, the future is the second end, the present is the
middle, craving is the seamstress.</p>
<p>A third venerable Thera offered his interpretation. For him, one end is pleasant
feeling, the second end is unpleasant or painful feeling, and the middle is
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling. Craving is again the seamstress.</p>
<p>A fourth venerable Thera opines that the one end is name, the second end is
form, the middle is consciousness and the seamstress is craving.</p>
<p>A fifth venerable Thera puts forward the view that the one end is the six
internal sense-spheres, the second end is the six external sense-spheres,
consciousness is the middle and craving is the seamstress.</p>
<p>A sixth venerable Thera is of the opinion that the one end is <em>sakkāya</em>, a term
for the five aggregates of grasping, literally the ‘existing body’. The second
end, according to him, is the arising of <em>sakkāya</em>. The middle is the cessation
of <em>sakkāya</em>. As before, the seamstress is craving.</p>
<p>When six explanations had come up before the symposium, one monk suggested,
somewhat like a point of order, that since six different interpretations have
come up, it would be best to approach the teacher, the Fortunate One, and report
the discussion for clarification and correct judgement.</p>
<p>Approving that suggestion, they all went to the Buddha and asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kassa nu kho, bhante, subhāsitaṁ?</em></p>
<p>Venerable sir, whose words are well spoken?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what you all have said is well said from some point of view or other.
But that for which I preached that verse in the <em>Metteyyapañha</em> is this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quoting the verse in question the Buddha explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, contact is one end, the arising of contact is the second end, the
cessation of contact is in the middle, craving is the seamstress, for it is
craving that puts the stitch for the birth of this or that existence.</p>
<p>In so far, monks, does a monk understand by higher knowledge what is to be
understood by higher knowledge, and comprehend by full understanding what is
to be comprehended by full understanding. Understanding by higher knowledge
what is to be understood by higher knowledge, and comprehending by full
understanding what is to be comprehended by full understanding, he becomes an
ender of suffering in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s explanation happens to coincide with the interpretation given by
the first speaker at the symposium. However, since he ratifies all the six
interpretations as well said, we can see how profound and at the same time broad
the meaning of this cryptic verse is.</p>
<p>Let us now try to understand these six explanations. One can make use of these
six as meditation topics. The verse has a pragmatic value and so also the
explanations given. What is the business of this seamstress or weaver?</p>
<p>According to the first interpretation, craving stitches up the first end,
contact, with the second end, the arising of contact, ignoring the middle, the
cessation of contact. It is beneath this middle, the cessation of contact, that
ignorance lurks.</p>
<p>As the line implies: <em>majjhe mantā na lippati</em>, “with wisdom does not get
attached to the middle”, when what is in the middle is understood, there is
emancipation. One is released from craving. So our special attention should be
directed to what lies in the middle, the cessation of contact.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Therefore, according to the first interpretation, the seamstress, craving,
stitches up contact and the arising of contact, ignoring the cessation of
contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the second interpretation, the past and the future are stitched up, ignoring the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third interpretation takes it as a stitching up of unpleasant feeling and
pleasant feeling, ignoring the neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth interpretation speaks of stitching up name and form, ignoring consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the fifth interpretation, it is a case of stitching up the six internal
sense-spheres with the six external sense-spheres, ignoring consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sixth interpretation, we are told of a stitching up of <em>sakkāya</em>, or
‘existing-body’, with the arising of the existing-body, ignoring the
cessation of the existing-body.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We mentioned above that in sewing as well as in weaving there is an attempt to
reduce a gap by stitching up or knitting up. These interpretations show us that
ignoring the middle is a common trait in the worldling. It is there that
ignorance lurks. If one rightly understands this middle dispassion sets in,
leading to disenchantment, relinquishment and deliverance.</p>
<p>Let us now turn our attention to a few parallel discourses that throw some light
on the depth of these meditation topics. We come across two verses in the
<em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which are relevant to the first
interpretation, namely that which concerns contact, the arising of contact and
the cessation of contact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sukhaṁ vā yadi va dukkhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>adukkhamasukhaṁ sahā,</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattañ ca bahiddhā ca</em> <br />
<em>yaṁ kiñci atthi veditaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ ’dukkhan’ti ñatvāna,</em></p>
<p><em>mosadhammaṁ palokinaṁ</em>, <br />
<em>phussa phussa vayaṁ passaṁ</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ tattha virajjati,</em> <br />
<em>vedanānaṁ khayā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nicchāto parinibbuto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1044-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1044">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Be it pleasant or unpleasant, <br />
Or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, <br />
Inwardly or outwardly, <br />
All what is felt, <br />
Knowing it as ‘pain’,</p>
<p>Delusive and brittle, <br />
Touch after touch, seeing how it wanes, <br />
That way he grows dispassionate therein, <br />
By the extinction of feeling it is <br />
That a monk becomes hungerless and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following two lines are particularly significant, as they are relevant to
the knowledge of ‘breaking up’ in the development of insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>phussa phussa vayaṁ passaṁ</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ tattha virajjati.</em></p>
<p>Touch after touch, seeing how it wanes, <br />
that way he grows dispassionate therein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems, therefore, that generally the cessation of contact is ignored or
slurred over by the worldling’s mind, busy with the arising aspect. Therefore
the seeing of cessation comes only with the insight knowledge of seeing the
breaking up, <em>bhaṅgañāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>As an illustration in support of the second interpretation we may quote the
following verses from the <em>Bhaddekarattasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Atītaṁ nānvāgameyya,</em> <br />
<em>nappaṭikaṅkhe anāgataṁ</em> <br />
<em>yad atītaṁ pahīnaṁ taṁ</em> <br />
<em>appattañ ca anāgataṁ.</em> <br />
<em>Paccuppannañ ca yo dhammaṁ</em> <br />
<em>tattha tattha vipassati,</em> <br />
<em>asaṁhīraṁ asaṁkuppaṁ</em> <br />
<em>taṁ vidvā-m-anubrūhaye.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1045-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1045">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Let one not trace back whatever is past, <br />
Nor keep on hankering for the not yet come, <br />
Whatever is past is gone for good, <br />
That which is future is yet to come. <br />
But [whoever] sees that which rises up, <br />
As now with insight as and when it comes, <br />
Neither ‘drawing in’ nor ‘pushing on’, <br />
That kind of stage should the wise cultivate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the reflection on preparations, <em>saṅkhārā</em>, in deep insight meditation, it is
the present preparations that are presented to reflection. That is why we find
the apparently unusual order <em>atīta – anāgata – paccuppanna</em>, ‘past – future –
present’, mentioned everywhere in the discourses.</p>
<p>To reflect on past preparations is relatively easy, so also are the future
preparations. It is the present preparations that are elusive and difficult to
muster. But in deep insight meditation the attention should be on the present
preparations. So much is enough for the second interpretation.</p>
<p>The third interpretation has to do with the three grades of feeling, the
pleasant, unpleasant and the neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant. About these we
have already discussed at length, on an earlier occasion, in connection with the
long dialogue between the Venerable <em>arahant</em> nun Dhammadinnā and the lay
disciple Visākha on the question of those three grades of feeling. Suffice it
for the present to cite the following relevant sections of that dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sukhāya vedanāya dukkhā vedanā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>dukkhāya vedanāya sukhā vedanā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>adukkhamasukhāya vedanāya avijjā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>avijjāya vijjā paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>vijjāya vimutti paṭibhāgo …</em> <br />
<em>vimuttiyā Nibbānaṁ paṭibhāgo.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1046-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1046">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Unpleasant feeling is the counterpart of pleasant feeling … <br />
pleasant feeling is the counterpart of unpleasant feeling … <br />
ignorance is the counterpart of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling … <br />
knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance … <br />
deliverance is the counterpart of knowledge … <br />
Nibbāna is the counterpart of deliverance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The counterpart or the ‘other half’ of pleasant feeling is unpleasant feeling.
The counterpart of unpleasant feeling is pleasant feeling. Between these two
there is a circularity in relationship, a seesawing. There is no way out.</p>
<p>But there is in the middle neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling. The
counterpart of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling is ignorance. So we see
how the neutrality and indifference of equanimity has beneath it ignorance.</p>
<p>But luckily there is the good side in this pair of counterparts. Deliverance
lies that way, for knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance. When ignorance is
displaced, knowledge surfaces. From knowledge comes deliverance, and from
deliverance Nibbāna or extinction. This much is enough for the third
interpretation.</p>
<p>Now for the fourth interpretation. Here we have consciousness between name-and-form. Let us remind ourselves of the two verses quoted in an earlier sermon from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpūpagā sattā</em> <br />
<em>ye ca arūpaṭṭhāyino,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhaṁ appajānantā</em> <br />
<em>āgantāro punabbhavaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Ye ca rūpe pariññāya,</em> <br />
<em>arūpesu asaṇṭhitā,</em> <br />
<em>nirodhe ye vimuccanti,</em> <br />
<em>te janā maccuhāyino.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1047-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1047">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Those beings that go to realms of form, <br />
And those who are settled in formless realms, <br />
Not understanding the fact of cessation, <br />
Come back again and again to existence.</p>
<p>Those who, having comprehended realms of form, <br />
Do not settle in formless realms, <br />
Are released in the experience of cessation, <br />
It is they that are the dispellers of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cessation here referred to is the cessation of consciousness, or the
cessation of becoming. Such emancipated ones are called ‘dispellers of death’,
<em>maccuhāyino</em>.</p>
<p>We have mentioned earlier that, before the advent of the Buddha and even
afterwards, sages like Āḷāra Kālāma tried to escape form, <em>rūpa</em>, by grasping
the formless, <em>arūpa</em>. But only the Buddha could point out that one cannot win
release from form by resorting to the formless. Release from both should be the
aim.</p>
<p>How could that come about? By the cessation of consciousness which discriminates
between form and formless. It is tantamount to the cessation of existence,
<em>bhavanirodha</em>.</p>
<p>As a little hint to understand this deep point, we may allude to that simile of
the dog on the plank across the stream which we brought up several times. Why
does that dog keep on looking at the dog it sees in the water, its own
reflection? Because it is unaware of the reflexive quality of the water.</p>
<p>Consciousness is like that water which has the quality of reflecting on its
surface. What is there between the <strong>seen</strong> dog and the <strong>looking</strong> dog as the
middle is consciousness itself. One can therefore understand why consciousness
is said to be in the middle between name and form.</p>
<p>Generally, in the traditional analysis of the relation between name-and-form and
consciousness, this fact is overlooked. True to the simile of the magical
illusion, given to consciousness, its middle position between name and form is
difficult for one to understand. Had the dog understood the reflective quality
of water, it would not halt on that plank to gaze down and growl.</p>
<p>The fifth interpretation puts the six internal sense-spheres and the six
external sense-spheres on either side, to have consciousness in the middle. A
brief explanation would suffice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dvayaṁ, bhikkhave, paṭicca viññāṇaṁ sambhoti</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1048-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1048">17</a></sup></p>
<p>monks, dependent on a dyad consciousness arises,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… says the Buddha. That is to say, dependent on internal and external
sense-spheres consciousness arises. As we have already pointed out,
consciousness is the very discrimination between the two. Therefore
consciousness is the middle.</p>
<p>So at the moment when one understands consciousness, one realizes that the fault
lies in this discrimination itself. The farther limit of the internal is the
nearer limit of the external. One understands then that the gap, the interstice
between them, is something imagined.</p>
<p>Then as to the sixth interpretation, we have the <em>sakkāya</em>, the ‘existing body’,
and <em>sakkāyasamudaya</em>, the arising of the existing body, as the two ends.</p>
<p>Because the term <em>sakkāya</em> is not often met with, it might be difficult to
understand what it means. To be brief, the Buddha has defined the term as
referring to the five aggregates of grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1049-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1049">18</a></sup> Its derivation, <em>sat +
kāya</em>, indicates that the term is suggestive of the tendency to take the whole
group as existing, giving way to the perception of the compact, <em>ghanasaññā</em>.</p>
<p>The arising of this notion of an existing body is <em>chandarāga</em> or desire and
lust. It is due to desire or craving that one grasps a heap as a compact whole.
The cessation of the existing body is the abandonment of desire and lust. This,
then, is a summary of the salient points in these six interpretations as
meditation topics for realization.</p>
<p>Let us now turn our attention to the sewing and weaving spoken of here. We have
mentioned above that both in sewing and weaving a knotting comes in, as a way of
reducing the gap. This knotting involves some kind of attracting, binding and
entangling. In the case of a sewing machine, every time the needle goes down,
the shuttle hastens to put a knot for the stitch. So long as this attraction
continues, the stitching goes on.</p>
<p>There is some relation between sewing and weaving. Sewing is an attempt to put
together two folds. In weaving a single thread of cotton or wool is looped into
two folds. In both there is a formation of knots. As already mentioned, knots
are formed by some sort of attraction, binding and entangling.</p>
<p>Now craving is the seamstress who puts the stitches to this existence, <em>bhava</em>.
She has a long line of qualifications for it. <em>Ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā
tatratatrābhinandinī</em> are some of the epithets for craving.</p>
<p>She is the perpetrator in re-becoming or renewed existence, <em>ponobhavikā</em>,
bringing about birth after birth. She has a trait of delighting and lusting,
<em>nandirāgasahagatā</em>. Notoriously licentious she delights now here now there,
<em>tatratatrābhinandinī</em>. Like that seamstress, craving puts the stitches into
existence, even as the needle and the shuttle.</p>
<p>Craving draws in with <em>upādāna</em>, grasping, while conceit binds and views
complete the entanglement. That is how existence gets stitched up.</p>
<p>At whatever moment the shuttle runs out of its load of cotton, the apparent
stitches do not result in a seam. Similarly, in a weaving, if instead of drawing
in the thread to complete the knot it is drawn out, all what is woven will be
undone immediately. This is the difference between existence and its cessation.
Existence is a formation of knots and stress. Cessation is an unravelling of
knots and rest.</p>
<p><strong>Existence is a formation of knots and stress. Cessation is an unravelling of
knots and rest.</strong></p>
<p>The following verse in the <em>Suddhaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> seems to
put in a nutshell the philosophy behind the simile of the seamstress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na kappayanti na purekkharonti</em> <br />
<em>‘accantasuddhī’ ti na te vadanti,</em> <br />
<em>ādānaganthaṁ gathitaṁ visajja,</em> <br />
<em>āsaṁ na kubbanti kuhiñci loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1050-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1050">19</a></sup></p>
<p>They fabricate not, they proffer not, <br />
Nor do they speak of a ‘highest purity’, <br />
Unravelling the tangled knot of grasping, <br />
They form no desire anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comments we have presented here, based on the verse beginning with <em>yo ubh’
anta-m-abhiññāya</em> could even be offered as a synopsis of the entire series of
thirty-three sermons.</p>
<p>All what we brought up in these sermons concerns the question of the two ends
and the middle. The episode of the two ends and the middle enshrines a profound
insight into the law of dependent arising and the Buddha’s teachings on the
middle path. That is why we said that the verse in question is both profound and
broad, as far as its meaning is concerned.</p>
<p>So now that we have presented this synoptic verse, we propose to wind up this
series of sermons.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the reason for many a misconception about Nibbāna is a lack
of understanding the law of dependent arising and the middle path. For the same
reason, true to the Buddha’s description of beings as taking delight in
existence, <em>bhavarāmā</em>, lusting for existence, <em>bhavaratā</em>, and rejoicing in
existence, <em>bhavasammuditā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1051-1"><a href="sermon-33.html#fn-fn1051">20</a></sup> Nibbāna came to be apprehensively
misconstrued as tantamount to annihilation.</p>
<p>Therefore even commentators were scared of the prospect of a cessation of
existence and tried to explain away Nibbāna through definitions that serve to
perpetuate craving for existence.</p>
<p>If by this attempt of ours to clear the path to Nibbāna, overgrown as it is
through neglect for many centuries, due to various social upheavals, any store
of merit accrued to us, may it duly go to our most venerable Great Preceptor,
who so magnanimously made the invitation to deliver this series of sermons. As
he is staying away for medical treatment at this moment, aged and ailing, let us
wish him quick recovery and long life. May all his Dhamma aspirations be
fulfilled!</p>
<p>May the devoted efforts in meditation of all those fellow dwellers in this holy
life, who listened to these sermons and taped them for the benefit of those who
would like to lend ear to them, be rewarded with success! Let a myriad <em>arahant</em>
lotuses, unsmeared by water and mud, bright petalled and sweet scented, bloom
all over the forest hermitage pond. May the merits accrued by giving these
sermons be shared by my departed parents, who brought me up, my teachers, who
gave me vision, and my friends, relatives and lay supporters, who helped keep
this frail body alive. May they all attain the bliss of Nibbāna!</p>
<p>May all gods and Brahmās and all beings rejoice in the merits accrued by these
sermons! May it conduce to the attainment of that peaceful and excellent
Nibbāna! May the dispensation of the Fully Enlightened One endure long in this
world! Let this garland of well preached Dhamma words be a humble offering at
the foot of the Dhamma shrine, which received honour and worship even from the
Buddha himself.</p>
