</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-seventh sermon in the series
of sermons on Nibbāna. In our last sermon, we brought up some similes and
illustrations to explain why the suchness of the Tathāgata has been given
special emphasis in the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the Buddha’s sermon, comparing consciousness to a magic
show, we made an attempt to discover the secrets of a modern day magic show from
a hidden corner of the stage. The parable of the magic show revealed us the fact
that the direct and the indirect formulation of the Law of Dependent Arising,
known as <em>tathatā</em>, suchness, or <em>idapaccayatā</em>, specific conditionality, is
similar to witnessing a magic show from two different points of view. That is to
say, the deluded point of view of the spectator in the audience and the
discerning point of view of the wisdom-eyed critic, hidden in a corner of the
stage.</p>
<p>The reason for the riddle-like outward appearance of the <em>Kāḷakārāmasutta</em> is
the problem of resolving the conflict between these two points of view. However,
the fact that the Tathāgata resolved this conflict at a supramundane level and
enjoyed the bliss of emancipation comes to light in the first three discourses
of the <em>Bodhivagga</em> in the <em>Udāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn871-1"><a href="#fn-fn871">2</a></sup></p>
<p>These three discourses tell us that, after the attainment of enlightenment, the
Buddha spent the first week in the same seated posture under the Bodhi tree, and
that on the last night of the week he reflected on the Law of Dependent Arising
in the direct order in the first watch of the night, in the reverse order in the
second watch, and both in direct and reverse order in the last watch.</p>
<p>These last-mentioned reflection, both in direct and reverse order, is like a
compromise between the deluded point of view and the discerning point of view,
mentioned above. Now, in a magic show to see <strong>how</strong> the magic is performed, is
to get disenchanted with it, to make it fade away and cease, to free the mind
from its spell. By seeing <strong>how</strong> a magician performs, one gets disgusted with
<strong>what</strong> he performs. Similarly, seeing the arising of the six bases of
sense-contact is the way to get disenchanted with them, to make them fade away
and cease, to transcend them and be emancipated.</p>
<p>We come across two highly significant verses in the <em>Soṇasutta</em> among the Sixes
of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> with reference to the emancipation of the mind of an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nekkhammaṁ adhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>pavivekañca cetaso,</em> <br />
<em>abhyāpajjhādhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>upādānakkhayassa ca,</em></p>
<p><em>taṇhakkhayādhimuttassa,</em> <br />
<em>asammohañca cetaso,</em> <br />
<em>disvā āyatanuppādaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>sammā cittaṁ vimuccati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn872-1"><a href="#fn-fn872">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The mind of one who is fully attuned <br />
To renunciation and mental solitude, <br />
Who is inclined towards harmlessness, <br />
Ending of grasping,</p>
<p>Extirpation of craving, <br />
And non-delusion of mind, <br />
On seeing the arising of sense-bases, <br />
Is fully emancipated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see how the sense-bases arise is to be released in mind. Accordingly we can
understand how the magic consciousness of one who is enjoying a magic show comes
to cease by comprehending it. Magic consciousness subsides. In other words, it
is transformed into a non-manifestative consciousness, which no longer displays
any magic.</p>
<p>That is the mental transformation that occurred in the man who watched the magic
show from a hidden corner of the stage. This gives us a clue to the cessation of
consciousness in the <em>arahant</em> and the consequent non-manifestative
consciousness attributed to him.</p>
<p>The <em>Dvāyatanānupassanasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> also bears testimony to this
fact. The title itself testifies to the question of duality forming the theme of
this discourse. Throughout the sutta we find a refrain-like distinction between
the arising and the ceasing of various phenomena. It is like an illustration of
the two aspects of the problem that confronted the Buddha. Now that we are
concerned with the question of the cessation of consciousness, let us quote the
relevant couplet of verses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci dukkhaṁ sambhoti,</em> <br />
<em>sabbaṁ viññāṇapaccayā,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇassa nirodhena</em> <br />
<em>natthi dukkhassa sambhavo.</em></p>
<p><em>Etam ādīnavaṁ ñatvā,</em> <br />
<em>‘dukkhaṁ viññāṇapaccayā’,</em> <br />
<em>viññāṇūpasamā bhikkhu,</em> <br />
<em>nicchāto parinibbuto.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn873-1"><a href="#fn-fn873">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever suffering that arises, <br />
All that is due to consciousness, <br />
With the cessation of consciousness, <br />
There is no arising of suffering.</p>
<p>Knowing this peril: <br />
‘This suffering dependent on consciousness’, <br />
By calming down consciousness, a monk <br />
Is hunger-less and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comparison between the magic show and consciousness becomes more meaningful
in the context of this discourse. As in the case of a magic show, the delusory
character of the magic of consciousness is traceable to the perception of form.
It is the perception of form which gives rise to the host of reckonings through
cravings, conceits and views, which bring about a delusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, a monk intent on attaining Nibbāna has to get rid of the magical
spell of the perception of form. The verse we cited from the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>
the other day has an allusion to this requirement. That verse, beginning with
the words <em>na saññasaññī,</em> is an attempt to answer the question raised in a
previous verse in that sutta, posing the query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kathaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn874-1"><a href="#fn-fn874">5</a></sup></p>
<p>to one, constituted in which manner, does form cease to exist?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us remind ourselves of that verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na saññasaññī, na visaññasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>no pi asaññī na vibhūtasaññī,</em> <br />
<em>evaṁ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā.</em></p>
<p>He is not conscious of normal perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor is he unconscious, <br />
He is not devoid of perception, <br />
<span class="vin"></span> nor has he rescinded perception, <br />
It is to one thus constituted <br />
<span class="vin"></span> that form ceases to exist, <br />
For reckonings through prolificity <br />
<span class="vin"></span> have perception as their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the last line states a crucial fact. Reckonings, designations and the like,
born of prolificity, are traceable to perception in the last analysis. That is
to say, all that is due to perception.</p>
<p>Another reason why form has received special attention here, is the fact that it
is a precondition for contact. When there is form, there is the notion of
resistance. That is already implicit in the question that comes in a verse at
the beginning of the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kismiṁ vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn875-1"><a href="#fn-fn875">6</a></sup></p>
<p>when what is not there, do touches not touch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that query is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rūpe vibhūte na phusanti phassā</em>,</p>
<p>when form is not there, touches do not touch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a phrase relevant to this point in the <em>Saṅgītisutta</em> of the
<em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>, that is, <em>sanidassanasappaṭighaṁ rūpaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn876-1"><a href="#fn-fn876">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Materiality, according to this phrase, has two characteristics. It has the
quality of manifesting itself, <em>sanidassana</em>; it also offers resistance,
<em>sappaṭigha</em>. Both these aspects are hinted at in a verse from the <em>Jaṭāsutta</em>
we had quoted at the very beginning of this series of sermons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em> <br />
<em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca,</em> <br />
<em>etthasā chijjate jaṭā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn877-1"><a href="#fn-fn877">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Jaṭāsutta</em> tells us the place where the tangle within and the tangle
without, <em>antojaṭā bahijaṭā</em>, of this gigantic <em>saṁsāric</em> puzzle is solved. And
here is the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherein name and form <br />
As well as resistance and the perception of form <br />
Are completely cut off, <br />
It is there that the tangle gets snapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase <em>paṭighaṁ rūpasaññā ca</em> is particularly significant. Not only the
term <em>paṭigha</em>, implying ‘resistance’, but also the term <em>rūpasaññā</em> deserves
our attention, as it is suggestive of the connection between form and
perception. It is perception that brings an image of form. Perception is the
source of various reckonings and destinations.</p>
<p>The term <em>saññā</em> has connotations of a ‘mark’, a ‘sign’, or a ‘token’, as we
have already pointed out.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn878-1"><a href="#fn-fn878">9</a></sup> It is as if a party going through a forest is
blazing a trail for their return by marking notches on the trees with an axe.
The notion of permanence is therefore implicit in the term <em>saññā</em>.</p>
<p>So it is this <em>saññā</em> that gives rise to <em>papañcasaṅkhā</em>, reckonings through
prolificity. The compound term <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>, occurring in the
<em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn879-1"><a href="#fn-fn879">10</a></sup> is suggestive of this connection between <em>saññā</em>
and <em>saṅkhā</em>.</p>
<p>Reckonings, definitions and designations, arising from prolific perception, are
collectively termed <em>papañcasaññāsaṅkhā</em>. The significance attached to <em>saññā</em>
could easily be guessed by the following dictum in the <em>Guhaṭṭhakasutta</em> of the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāṁ pariññā vitareyya oghaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn880-1"><a href="#fn-fn880">11</a></sup></p>
<p>comprehend perception and cross the flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full comprehension of the nature of perception enables one to cross the four
great floods of defilements in <em>saṁsāra</em>. In other words, the penetrative
understanding of perception is the way to deliverance.</p>
<p>Let us now go a little deeper into the connotations of the term <em>saññā</em>. In the
sense of ‘sign’ or ‘token’, it has to have something to signify or symbolize.
Otherwise there is no possibility of designation. A sign can be significant only
if there is something to signify. This is a statement that might need a lot of
reflection before it is granted.</p>
<p>A sign properly so called is something that signifies, and when there is nothing
to signify, it ceases to be a sign. So also is the case with the symbol. This is
a norm which is well explained in the <em>Mahāvedallasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em>. In the course of a dialogue between Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita and
Venerable Sāriputta, we find in that sutta the following pronouncement made by
Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo kho, āvuso, kiñcano, doso kiñcano, moho kiñcano, te khīnāsavassa
bhikkhuno pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvakatā āyatiṁ
anuppādadhammā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn881-1"><a href="#fn-fn881">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Lust, friend, is something, hate is something, delusion is something. They
have been abandoned in an influx-free monk, uprooted, made like a palm tree
deprived of its site, made extinct and rendered incapable of sprouting again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So lust is a something, hate is a something, delusion is a something. Now a sign
is significant and a symbol is symbolic only when there is something. Another
statement that occurs a little later in that dialogue offers us a clarification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo kho, āvuso, nimittakaraṇo, doso nimittakaraṇo, moho nimittakaraṇo</em>,</p>
<p>lust, friend, is significative, hate is significative, delusion is
significative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can well infer that it is only so long as there are things like lust,
hate and delusion that signs are significant. In other words, why the Tathāgata
declared that there is no essence in the magic show of consciousness is because
there is nothing in him that signs or symbols can signify or symbolize.</p>
<p>What are these things? Lust, hate and delusion. That is why the term <em>akiñcana</em>,
literally ‘thing-less’, is an epithet for the <em>arahant</em>. He is thing-less not
because he no longer has the worldly possessions of a layman, but because the
afore-said things lust, hate and delusion are extinct in him. For the Tathāgata,
the magic show of consciousness has nothing substantial in it, because there was
nothing in him to make the signs significant.</p>
<p>That man with discernment, who watched the magic show from a hidden corner of
the stage, found it to be hollow and meaningless, since he had, in a limited and
relative sense, got rid of attachment, aversion and delusion. That is to say,
after discovering the tricks of the magician, he lost the earlier impulses to
laugh, cry and fear. Now he has no curiosity, since the delusion is no more. At
least temporarily, ignorance has gone down in the light of understanding.
According to this norm, we can infer that signs become significant due to greed,
hate and delusion in our own minds. Perceptions pander to these emotive
tendencies.</p>
<p>The concluding verse of the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> is
particularly important, in that it sums up the <em>arahant’s</em> detachment regarding
perceptions and his release through wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saññāvirattassa na santi ganthā,</em> <br />
<em>paññāvimuttassa na santi mohā,</em> <br />
<em>saññañca diṭṭhiñca ye aggahesuṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te ghaṭṭayantā vicaranti loke.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn882-1"><a href="#fn-fn882">13</a></sup></p>
<p>To one detached from percepts there are no bonds, <br />
To one released through wisdom there are no delusions, <br />
Those who hold on to percepts and views, <br />
Go about wrangling in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this state of detachment from perceptions and release through wisdom that
is summed up by the phrase <em>anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ</em> in some
discourses. With reference to the <em>arahant</em> it is said that he has realized by
himself through higher knowledge in this very life that influx-free deliverance
of the mind and deliverance through wisdom, <em>anāsavaṁ cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ
diṭṭhevadhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn883-1"><a href="#fn-fn883">14</a></sup></p>
<p>So we could well infer that the <em>arahant</em> is free from the enticing bonds of
perceptions and the deceptive tricks of consciousness. It is this unshakeable
stability that finds expression in the epithets <em>anejo</em>, ‘immovable’, and
<em>ṭhito</em>, ‘stable’, used with reference to the <em>arahant</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn884-1"><a href="#fn-fn884">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Āneñjasappāyasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> opens with the following
exhortation by the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aniccā, bhikkhave, kāmā tucchā musā mosadhammā, māyākatam etaṁ, bhikkhave,
bālalāpanaṁ. Ye ca diṭṭhadhammikā kāmā, ye ca samparāyikā kāmā, yā ca
diṭṭhadhammikā kāmasaññā, yā ca samparāyikā kāmasañña, ubhayam etaṁ
Māradheyyaṁ, Mārass’esa visayo, Mārass’ esa nivāpo, Mārass’ esa
gocaro.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn885-1"><a href="#fn-fn885">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Impermanent, monks, are sense pleasures, they are empty, false and deceptive
by nature, they are conjuror’s tricks, monks, tricks that make fools prattle.
Whatever pleasures there are in this world, whatever pleasures that are in the
other world, whatever pleasurable percepts there are in this world, whatever
pleasurable percepts that are in the other world, they all are within the
realm of Māra, they are the domain of Māra, the bait of Māra, the beat of
Māra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This exhortation accords well with what was said above regarding the magic show.
It clearly gives the impression that there is the possibility of attaining a
state of mind in which those signs are no longer significant.</p>
<p>The comparison of consciousness to a magic show has deeper implications. The
insinuation is that one has to comprehend perception for what it is, in order to
become dispassionate towards it, <em>saññaṁ pariññā vitareyya oghaṁ</em>, “comprehend
perception and cross the flood”. When perception is understood inside out,
disenchantment sets in as a matter of course, since delusion is no more.</p>
<p>Three kinds of deliverances are mentioned in connection with the <em>arahants</em>,
namely <em>animitta</em>, the signless, <em>appaṇihita</em>, the undirected, and <em>suññata</em>,
the void.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn886-1"><a href="#fn-fn886">17</a></sup> We spoke of signs being significant. Now where there is no
signification, when one does not give any significance to signs, one does not
direct one’s mind to anything. <em>Paṇidhi</em> means ‘direction of the mind’, an
‘aspiration’. In the absence of any aspiration, there is nothing ‘essence-tial’
in existence.</p>
<p>There is a certain interconnection between the three deliverances. <em>Animitta</em>,
the signless, is that stage in which the mind refuses to take a sign or catch a
theme in anything. Where lust, hate and delusion are not there to give any
significance, signs become ineffective. That is the signless. Where there is no
tendency to take in signs, there is no aspiration, expectation or direction of
the mind.</p>
<p>It is as if dejection in regard to the magic show has given rise to
disenchantment and dispassion. When the mind is not directed to the magic show,
it ceases to exist. It is only when the mind is continually there, directed
towards the magic show or a film show, that they exist for a spectator. One
finds oneself born into a world of magic only when one sees something
substantial in it. A magic world is made up only when there is an incentive to
exist in it.</p>
<p>Deeper reflection on this simile of the magic show would fully expose the
interior of the magical illusion of consciousness. Where there is no grasping at
signs, there is no direction or expectation, in the absence of which, existence
ceases to appear substantial. That is why the three terms singless, <em>animitta</em>,
undirected, <em>appaṇihita</em> and void <em>suññata</em>, are used with reference to an
<em>arahant</em>. These three terms come up in a different guise in a discourse on
Nibbāna we had discussed earlier. There they occur as <em>appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ</em>
and <em>anārammaṇaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn887-1"><a href="#fn-fn887">18</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Appatiṭṭhaṁ</em> means ‘unestablished’. Mind gets established when there is desire
or aspiration, <em>paṇidhi</em>. Contemplation on the suffering aspect,
<em>dukkhānupassanā</em>, eliminates desire. So the mind is unestablished.
Contemplation on not-self, <em>anattānupassanā</em>, does away with the notion of
substantiality, seeing nothing pithy or ‘essence-tial’ in existence.</p>
<p>Pith is something that endures. A tree that has pith has something durable,
though its leaves may drop off. Such notions of durability lose their hold on
the <em>arahant’s</em> mind. The contemplation of impermanence, <em>aniccānupassanā</em>,
ushers in the signless, <em>animitta</em>, state of the mind that takes no object,
<em>anārammaṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>The simile of the magic show throws light on all these aspects of deliverance.
Owing to this detachment from perception, <em>saññāviratta</em>, and release through
wisdom, <em>paññāvimutta</em>, an <em>arahant’s</em> point of view is totally different from
the wordling’s point of view. What appears as real for the worldling, is unreal
in the estimation of the <em>arahant</em>. There is such a wide gap between the two
viewpoints. This fact comes to light in the two kinds of reflections mentioned
in the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya ’idaṁ saccan’ti upanijjhāyitaṁ,
tadam ariyānaṁ ’etaṁ musā’ti yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya suddiṭṭhaṁ – ayaṁ
ekānupassanā. Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa

dutiyānupassanā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn888-1"><a href="#fn-fn888">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, whatsoever in the world with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the
progeny consisting of recluses, Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is pondered
over as ‘truth’, that by the <em>ariyans</em> has been well discerned with right
wisdom, as it is, as ‘untruth’. This is one mode of reflection. Monks,
whatsoever in the world with its gods, Māras and Brahmas, among the progeny
consisting of recluses, Brahmins, gods and men, whatsoever is pondered over as
‘untruth’, that by the <em>ariyans</em> has been well discerned with right wisdom, as
it is, as ‘truth’. This is the second mode of reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, one can well imagine what a great difference, what a contrast exists
between the two stand-points. The same idea is expressed in the verses that
follow, some of which we had cited earlier too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anattani attamāniṁ,</em> <br />
<em>passa lokaṁ sadevakaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>niviṭṭhaṁ nāmarūpasmiṁ,</em> <br />
<em>idaṁ saccan’ti maññati.</em></p>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti,</em> <br />
<em>tato taṁ hoti aññathā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ hi tassa musā hoti,</em> <br />
<em>mosadhammaṁ hi ittaraṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Amosadhammaṁ nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā saccato vidū,</em> <br />
<em>te ve saccābhisamayā,</em> <br />
<em>nicchātā parinibbutā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn889-1"><a href="#fn-fn889">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Just see the world, with all its gods, <br />
Fancying a self where none exists, <br />
Entrenched in name-and-form it holds <br />
The conceit that this is real.</p>
<p>In whatever way they imagine, <br />
Thereby it turns otherwise, <br />
That itself is the falsity, <br />
Of this puerile deceptive thing.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is unfalsifying in its nature, <br />
That they understood as the truth, <br />
And, indeed, by the higher understanding of that truth, <br />
They have become hunger-less and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us go for a homely illustration to familiarize ourselves with the facts we
have related so far. Two friends are seen drawing something together on a board
with two kinds of paints. Let us have a closer look. They are painting a chess
board. Now the board is chequered. Some throw-away chunks of wood are also
painted for the pieces. So the board and pieces are ready.</p>
<p>Though they are the best of friends and amicably painted the chessboard, the
game of chess demands two sides – the principle of duality. They give in to the
demand and confront each other in a playful mood. A hazy idea of victory and
defeat, another duality, hovers above them. But they are playing the game just
for fun, to while away the time. Though it is for fun, there is a competition.
Though there is a competition, it is fun.</p>
<p>While the chess-game is in progress, a happy-go-lucky benefactor comes by and
offers a handsome prize for the prospective winner, to enliven the game. From
now onwards, it is not just for fun or to while away the time that the two
friends are playing chess. Now that the prospect of a prize has aroused greed in
them, the innocuous game becomes a tussle for a prize.</p>
<p>Worthless pieces dazzle with the prospect of a prize. But just then, there comes
a pervert killjoy, who shows a threatening weapon and adds a new rule to the
game. The winner will get the prize all right, but the loser he will kill with
his deadly weapon.</p>
<p>So what is the position now? The sportive spirit is gone. It is now a struggle
for dear life. The two friends are now eying each other as an enemy. It is no
longer a game, but a miserable struggle to escape death.</p>
<p>We do not know, how exactly the game ended. But let us hold the post mortem all
the same. We saw how those worthless chunks of wood picked up to serve as pieces
on the chessboard, received special recognition once they took on the paint.
They represented two sides.</p>
<p>With the prospect of a prize, they got animated in the course of the game, due
to cravings, conceits and views in the minds of the two players. Those impulses
were so overwhelming that especially after the death knell sounded, the whole
chess board became the world for these two friends. Their entire attention was
on the board – a life and death struggle.</p>
<p>But this is only one aspect of our illustration. The world, in fact, is a
chessboard, where an unending chess game goes on. Let us look at the other
aspect. Now, for the <em>arahant</em>, the whole world appears like a chessboard. That
is why the <em>arahant</em> Adhimutta, when the bandits caught him while passing
through a forest and got ready to kill him, uttered the following instructive
verse, which we had quoted earlier too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yadā paññāya passati,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn890-1"><a href="#fn-fn890">21</a></sup></p>
<p>When one sees with wisdom, <br />
This world as comparable to grass and twigs, <br />
Not finding anything worthwhile holding onto as mine, <br />
One does not grieve, saying: ‘O! I have nothing!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Adhimutta’s fearless challenge to the bandit chief was extraordinary
– you may kill me if you like, but the position is this: When one sees with
wisdom the entire world, the world of the five aggregates, as comparable to
grass and twigs, one does not experience any egoism and therefore does not
grieve the loss of one’s life.</p>
<p>Some verses uttered by the Buddha deepen our understanding of the <em>arahant’s</em>
standpoint. The following verse of the <em>Dhammapada</em>, for instance, highlights
the conflict between victory and defeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jayaṁ veraṁ passavati,</em> <br />
<em>dukkhaṁ seti parājito,</em> <br />
<em>upasanto sukhaṁ seti</em> <br />
<em>hitvā jayaparājayaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn891-1"><a href="#fn-fn891">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Victory breeds hatred, <br />
In sorrow lies the defeated, <br />
The one serene is ever at peace, <br />
Giving up victory and defeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the chess game, the idea of winning gives rise to hatred. The loser in the
game has sorrow as his lot. But the <em>arahant</em> is at peace, having given up
victory and defeat. Isn’t it enough for him to give up victory? Why is it said
that he gives up both victory and defeat?</p>
<p>These two go as a pair. This recognition of a duality is a distinctive feature
of this Dhamma. It gives, in a nutshell, the essence of this Dhamma. The idea of
a duality is traceable to the vortex between consciousness and name-and-form.
The same idea comes up in the following verse of the <em>Attadaṇḍasutta</em> in the
<em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassa natthi ’idaṁ me’ti</em> <br />
<em>‘paresaṁ’ vā pi kiñcanaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>mamattaṁ so asaṁvindaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>’natthi me’ti na socati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn892-1"><a href="#fn-fn892">23</a></sup></p>
<p>He who has nothing to call ‘this is mine’, <br />
Not even something to recognize as ‘theirs’, <br />
Finding no egoism within himself, <br />
He grieves not, crying: ‘O! I have nothing!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far in this series of sermons on Nibbāna, we were trying to explain what sort
of a state Nibbāna is. We had to do so, because there has been quite a lot of
confusion and controversy regarding Nibbāna as the aim of the spiritual
endeavour in Buddhism. The situation today is no better. Many of those who
aspire to Nibbāna today, aim not at the cessation of existence, but at some form
of quasi existence as a surrogate Nibbāna.</p>
<p>If the aiming is wrong, will the arrow reach the target? Our attempt so far has
been to clarify and highlight this target, which we call Nibbāna. If we have
been successful in this attempt, the task before us now is to adumbrate the
salient features of the path of practice.</p>
<p>Up to now, we have been administering a purgative, to dispel some deep-rooted
wrong notions. If it has worked, it is time now for the elixir. In the
fore-going sermons, we had occasion to bring up a number of key terms in the
suttas, which have been more or less relegated into the limbo and rarely come up
in serious Dhamma discussions.</p>
<p>We have highlighted such key terms as <em>suññatā, dvayatā, tathatā, atammayatā,
idappaccayatā, papañca,</em> and <em>maññanā</em>. We have also discussed some aspects of
their significance. But in doing so, our main concern was the dispelling of some
misconceptions about Nibbāna as the goal.</p>
<p>The aim of this series of sermons, however, is not the satisfying of some
curiosity at an academic level. It is to pave the way for an attainment of this
goal, by rediscovering the intrinsic qualities of this Dhamma that is well
proclaimed, <em>svākkhāto</em>, visible here and now, <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em>, timeless,
<em>akāliko</em>, inviting one to come and see, <em>ehipassiko</em>, leading one onwards,
<em>opanayiko</em>, and realizable personally by the wise, <em>paccattaṁ veditabbo
viññūhi.</em> So the few sermons that will follow, might well be an elixir to the
minds of those meditators striving hard day and night to realize Nibbāna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lobho, doso ca moho ca,</em> <br />
<em>purisaṁ pāpacetasaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>hiṁsanti attasambhūtā,</em> <br />
<em>tacasāraṁ va samphalaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn893-1"><a href="#fn-fn893">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Greed and hate and delusion too, <br />
Sprung from within work harm on him <br />
Of evil wit, as does its fruit <br />
On the reed for which the bark is pith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main idea behind this verse is that the three defilements – greed, hatred
and delusion – spring up from within, that they are <em>attasambhūta</em>,
self-begotten. What is the provocation for such a statement?</p>
<p>It is generally believed that greed, hatred and delusion originate from external
signs. The magic show and the chess game have shown us how signs become
significant. They become significant because they find something within that
they can signify and symbolize.</p>
<p>Now this is where the question of radical reflection, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, comes
in. What the Buddha brings up in this particular context, is the relevance of
that radical reflection as a pre-requisite for treading the path.</p>
<p>The worldling thinks that greed, hatred and delusion arise due to external
signs. The Buddha points out that they arise from within an individual and
destroy him as in the case of the fruit of a reed or bamboo. It is this same
question of radical reflection that came up earlier in the course of our
discussion of the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em>, based on the following deep and winding
statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cakkhuñc’āvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṁ, tiṇṇaṁ saṅgati
phasso, phassapaccayā vedanā, yaṁ vedeti taṁ sañjānāti, yaṁ sañjānāti taṁ
vitakketi, yaṁ vitakketi taṁ papañceti, yaṁ papañceti tatonidānaṁ purisaṁ
papañcasaññāsaṅkhā samudācaranti atītānāgatapaccuppannesu cakkhuviññeyyesu
rūpesu.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn894-1"><a href="#fn-fn894">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Dependent on eye and forms, friend, arises eye-consciousness; the concurrence
of the three is contact; because of contact, feeling; what one feels, one
perceives; what one perceives, one reasons about; what one reasons about, one
proliferates; what one proliferates, owing to that, reckonings born of
prolific perceptions overwhelm him in regard to forms cognizable by the eye
relating to the past, the future and the present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eye-consciousness, for instance, arises depending on eye and forms. The
concurrence of these three is called contact. Depending on this contact arises
feeling. What one feels, one perceives, and what one perceives, one reasons
about. The reasoning about leads to a proliferation that brings about an
obsession, as a result of which the reckonings born of prolific perceptions
overwhelm the individual concerned.</p>
<p>The process is somewhat similar to the destruction of the reed by its own fruit.
It shows how non-radical reflection comes about. Radical reflection is
undermined when proliferation takes over. The true source, the matrix, is
ignored, with the result an obsession follows, tantamount to an entanglement
within and without, <em>anto jaṭā bahi jaṭā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn895-1"><a href="#fn-fn895">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The paramount importance of radical reflection is revealed by the
<em>Sūcilomasutta</em> found in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, as well as in the <em>Sagāthakavagga</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. The <em>yakkha</em> Sūciloma poses some questions to the
Buddha in the following verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo ca doso ca kutonidānā,</em> <br />
<em>aratī ratī lomahaṁso kutojā,</em> <br />
<em>kuto samuṭṭhāya manovitakkā,</em> <br />
<em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn896-1"><a href="#fn-fn896">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Lust and hate, whence caused are they, <br />
Whence spring dislike, delight and terror, <br />
Whence arising do thoughts disperse, <br />
Like children leaving their mother’s lap?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha answers those questions in three verses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rāgo ca doso ca itonidānā,</em> <br />
<em>aratī ratī lomahaṁso itojā,</em> <br />
<em>ito samuṭṭhāya manovitakkā,</em> <br />
<em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti.</em></p>
<p><em>Snehajā attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>nigrodhasseva khandhajā,</em> <br />
<em>puthū visattā kāmesu</em> <br />
<em>māluvā va vitatā vane.</em></p>
<p><em>Ye naṁ pajānanti yatonidānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te naṁ vinodenti, suṇohi yakkha,</em> <br />
<em>te duttaram ogham imaṁ taranti,</em> <br />
<em>atiṇṇapubbaṁ apunabbhavāya.</em></p>
<p>It is hence that lust and hate are caused, <br />
Hence spring dislike, delight and terror, <br />
Arising hence do thoughts disperse, <br />
Like children leaving their mother’s lap.</p>
<p>Moisture-born and self-begotten, <br />
Like the banyan’s trunk-born runners <br />
They cleave to diverse objects of sense, <br />
Like the <em>māluvā</em> creeper entwining the forest.</p>
<p>And they that know wherefrom it springs, <br />
They dispel it, listen, O! Yakkha. <br />
They cross this flood so hard to cross, <br />
Never crossed before, to become no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In explaining these verses, we are forced to depart from the commentarial trend.
The point of controversy is the phrase <em>kumārakā dhaṅkam iv’ ossajanti</em>,
recognized by the commentary as the last line of Sūciloma’s verse.</p>
<p>We adopted the variant reading <em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em>, found in some
editions. Let us first try to understand how the commentary interprets this
verse.</p>
<p>Its interpretation centres around the word <em>dhaṅka</em>, which means a crow. In
order to explain how thoughts disperse, it alludes to a game among village lads,
in which they tie the leg of a crow with a long string and let it fly away so
that it is forced to come back and fall at their feet.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn897-1"><a href="#fn-fn897">28</a></sup> The commentary
rather arbitrarily breaks up the compound term <em>manovitakkā</em> in trying to
explain that evil thoughts, <em>vitakkā</em>, distract the mind, <em>mano</em>.</p>
<p>If the variant reading <em>kumārakā vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em> is adopted, the element
<em>v</em> in <em>vaṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em> could be taken as a hiatus filler, <em>āgama</em>, and
then we have the meaningful phrase <em>kumārakā aṁkam iv’ ossajanti</em>, “even as
children leave the lap”.</p>
<p>Lust and hate, delight and terror, spring from within. Even so are thoughts in
the mind, <em>manovitakkā</em>. We take it as one word, whereas the commentary breaks
it up into two words.</p>
<p>It is queer to find the same commentator analyzing this compound differently in
another context. In explaining the term <em>manovitakkā</em> occurring in the
<em>Kummasutta</em> of the <em>Devatā Saṁyutta</em> in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>, the commentary
says <em>’manovitakke’ti manamhi uppannavitakke</em>: “<em>manovitakka</em>, this means
thoughts arisen in the mind”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn898-1"><a href="#fn-fn898">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentator was forced to contradict himself in the present context, because
he wanted to justify the awkward simile of the game he himself had introduced.
The simile of leaving the mother’s lap, on the other hand, would make more
sense, particularly in the light of the second verse uttered by the Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Snehajā attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>nigrodhasseva khandhajā,</em> <br />
<em>puthū visattā kāmesu</em> <br />
<em>māluvā va vitatā vane.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse enshrines a deep idea. <em>Sneha</em> is a word which has such meanings as
‘moisture’ and ‘affection’. In the simile of the banyan tree, the trunk-born
runners are born of moisture. They are self-begotten.</p>
<p>Thoughts in the mind cleave to diverse external objects. Just as the runners of
a banyan tree, once they take root would even conceal the main trunk, which gave
them birth, so the thoughts in the mind, attached to external objects of sense,
would conceal their true source and origin.</p>
<p>Non-radical reflection could easily come in. The runners are moisture-born and
self-begotten from the point of view of the original banyan tree. The main trunk
gets overshadowed by its own runners.</p>
<p>The next simile has similar connotations. The <em>māluvā</em> creeper is a plant
parasite. When some bird drops a seed of a <em>māluvā</em> creeper into a fork of a
tree, after some time a creeper comes up. As time goes on, it overspreads the
tree, which gave it nourishment.</p>
<p>Both similes illustrate the nature of non radical reflection. Conceptual
proliferation obscures the true source, namely the psychological mainsprings of
defilements. Our interpretation of children leaving the mother’s lap would be
meaningful in the context of the two terms <em>snehajā</em>, ‘born of affection’, and
<em>attasambhūtā</em>, ‘self-begotten’. There is possibly a pun on the word <em>sneha</em>.
Children are affection-born and self-begotten, from a mother’s point of view.</p>
<p>The basic theme running through these verses is the origin and source of things.
The commentator’s simile of the crow could ill afford to accommodate all the
nuances of these pregnant terms. It distracts one from the main theme of these
verses. The questions asked concern the origin, <em>kuto nidānā, kutojā, kuto
samuṭṭhāya</em>, and the answers are in full accord: <em>ito nidānā, itojā, ito
samuṭṭhāya</em>.</p>
<p>With reference to thoughts in the mind, the term <em>snehajā</em> could even mean ‘born
of craving’, and <em>attasambhūtā</em> conveys their origination from within. As in the
case of the runners of the banyan tree and the <em>māluvā</em> creeper, those defiling
thoughts, arisen from within, once they get attached to sense objects outside,
obscure their true source. The result is the pursuit of a mirage, spurred on by
non-radical reflection.</p>
<p>The last verse is of immense importance. It says: But those who know from where
all these mental states arise, are able to dispel them. It is they who
successfully cross this flood, so hard to cross, and are freed from re-becoming.</p>
