</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.</p>
<p>The second sermon on Nibbāna has come up for today. Towards the end of our
sermon the other day we raised the point: Why is it improper to ask such
questions as: ‘What is the purpose of Nibbāna? Why should one attain
Nibbāna?’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">2</a></sup> Our explanation was that since the holy life or the Noble
Eightfold Path has Nibbāna as its ultimate aim, since it gets merged in
Nibbāna, any questions as to the ultimate purpose of Nibbāna would be
inappropriate.</p>
<p>In fact at some places in the canon we find the phrase <em>anuttara
brahmacariyapariyosāna</em> used with reference to Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">3</a></sup> It means that
Nibbāna is the supreme consummation of the holy life. The following standard
phrase announcing a new <em>arahant</em> is very often found in the suttas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yassatthāya kulaputtā sammadeva agārasmā anagāriyaṁ pabbajanti, tadanuttaraṁ
brahmacariyapariyosānaṁ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja
vihāsi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In this very life he realized by his own higher knowledge and attained to
that supreme consummation of the holy life for the purpose of which clansmen
of good family rightly go forth from home to homelessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is the justification for saying that one attains to Nibbāna by the
very completion of the holy life? This Noble Eightfold Path is a straight path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ujuko nāma so maggo, abhayā nāma sā disā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This path is called the ‘straight’ and the direction it goes is called the
‘fearless’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Itivuttaka</em> we come across a verse which expresses this idea more
vividly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sekhassa sikkhamānassa,</em> <br />
<em>ujumaggānusārino,</em> <br />
<em>khayasmiṁ paṭhamaṁ ñāṇaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tato aññā anantarā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To the learner, learning <br />
In pursuit of the straight path, <br />
First comes the knowledge of destruction <br />
And then immediately the certitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the fruit of <em>arahantship</em> which gives him the certitude of the
attainment of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Here the word <em>anantarā</em> has been used. That concentration proper to the fruit
of <em>arahantship</em> is called <em>ānantarikā samādhi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">7</a></sup> This means that the
attainment of the fruit is immediate.</p>
<p>Though it may be so in the case of the <em>arahant</em>, what about the stream-winner,
the <em>sotāpanna</em>, one may ask. There is a general belief that in the case of a
<em>sotāpanna</em> the vision of Nibbāna is like a glimpse of a distant lamp on a
road with many bends and the <em>sotāpanna</em> has just negotiated the first bend.</p>
<p>But in accordance with the Dhamma it may be said that the norm of immediacy is
applicable even to the knowledge of the first path. One who attains to the fruit
of stream-winning may be a beggar, an illiterate person, or a seven year old
child. It may be that he has heard the Dhamma for the first time. All the
same, a long line of epithets is used with reference to him in the suttas as
his qualifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammo pattadhammo viditadhammo pariyogāḷhadhammo tiṇṇavicikiccho
vigatakathaṁkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo satthusāsane</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammo</em>, he is one who has seen the Dhamma, the truth of Nibbāna. It
is said in the <em>Ratanasutta</em> that along with the vision of the first path, three
fetters are abandoned, namely <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>, the self-hood view, <em>vicikicchā</em>,
sceptical doubt, and <em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>, attachment to holy vows and ascetic
practices.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">9</a></sup> Some might argue that only these fetters are abandoned at this
stage, because it is a glimpse of Nibbāna from a distance.</p>
<p>But then there is this second epithet, <em>pattadhammo</em>, which means that he has
reached the Dhamma, that he has arrived at Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Not only that, he is <em>viditadhammo</em>, he is one who has understood the Dhamma,
which is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>He is <em>pariyogāḷhadhammo</em>, he has plunged into the Dhamma, he has dived into
the Dhamma, which is Nibbāna.</p>
<p>He is <em>tiṇṇavicikiccho</em>, he has crossed over doubts.</p>
<p><em>Vigatakathaṁkatho</em>, his waverings are gone.</p>
<p><em>Vesārajjappatto</em>, he has attained to proficiency.</p>
<p><em>Aparappaccayo satthusāsane</em>, in regard to the dispensation of the teacher he is
not dependent on others. And that is to say that he could attain to Nibbāna
even without another’s help, though of course with the teacher’s help he would
attain it sooner.</p>
<p>So this string of epithets testifies to the efficacy of the realization by the
first path. It is not a mere glimpse of Nibbāna from a distance. It is a
reaching, an arrival or a plunge into Nibbāna.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration we may bring in a legend connected with the history
of Sri Lanka. It is said that when King Gajabāhu invaded India, one of his
soldiers, Nīla, who had Herculean strength, parted the seawater with a huge
iron bar in order to make way for the king and the army. Now when the
supramundane path arises in the mind the power of thought is as mighty as the
blow of Nīla with his iron bar. Even with the first blow the sea-water parted,
so that one could see the bottom.</p>
<p>Similarly the sweeping influxes are parted for a moment when the transcendental
path arises in a mind, enabling one to see the very bottom – Nibbāna. In
other words, all preparations (<em>saṅkhāras</em>) are stilled for a moment, enabling
one to see the cessation of preparations.</p>
<p>We have just given a simile by way of illustration, but incidentally there is a
<em>Dhammapada</em> verse which comes closer to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma,</em> <br />
<em>kāme panuda brāhmaṇa</em>, <br />
<em>saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā,</em> <br />
<em>akataññū’si brāhmaṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Strive forth and cut off the stream, <br />
Discard, oh Brahmin, sense-desires, <br />
Having known the destruction of preparations, oh Brahmin, <br />
Become a knower of the un-made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this verse clearly indicates what the knowledge of the path does when it
arises. Just as one leaps forward and cuts off a stream of water, so it cuts
off, even for a moment, the preparations connected with craving. Thereby one
realizes the destruction of preparations – <em>saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā</em>.</p>
<p>Like the sea water parted by the blow of the iron bar, preparations part for a
moment to reveal the very bottom which is ‘unprepared’, the <em>asaṅkhata</em>.
<em>Akata</em>, or the un-made, is the same as <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the unprepared. So one has
had a momentary vision of the sea bottom, which is free from preparations. Of
course, after that experience, influxes flow in again. But one kind of influxes,
namely <em>diṭṭhāsavā</em>, influxes of views, are gone for good and will never flow in
again.</p>
<p>Now how was it that some with keen wisdom like Bāhiya attained <em>arahantship</em>
even while listening to a short sermon from the Buddha? They had dealt four
powerful blows in quick succession with the iron bar of the path-knowledge to
clear away all possible influxes.</p>
<p>What is called <em>akata</em> or <em>asaṅkhata</em>, the un-made or the un-prepared, is not
something out there in a distance, as an object of thought. It is not a sign to
be grasped by one who wants to attain Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Language encourages us to think in terms of signs. Very often we find it
difficult to get rid of this habit. The worldlings with their defilements have
to communicate with each other and the structure of the language has to answer
their needs. So the subject-object relationship has become a very significant
feature in a language. It always carries the implication that there is a thing
to be grasped and that there is someone who grasps, that there is a doer and a
thing done. So it is almost impossible to avoid such usages as: ‘I want to see
Nibbāna, I want to attain Nibbāna’. We are made to think in terms of getting
and attaining.</p>
<p>However sometimes the Buddha reminds us that this is only a conventional usage
and that these worldly usages are not to be taken too seriously. We come across
such an instance in the <em>Sagāthavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> where the Buddha
retorts to some questions put by a certain deity. The deity named Kakudha asks
the Buddha:</p>
<p>“Do you rejoice, oh recluse?”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">11</a></sup> And the Buddha retorts: “On getting what, friend?”
Then the deity asks: “Then, recluse, do you grieve?” And the Buddha quips back:
“On losing what, friend?” So the deity concludes: “Well then, recluse, you
neither rejoice nor grieve!” And the Buddha replies: “That is so, friend.”</p>
<p>It seems, then, that though we say we ‘attain’ Nibbāna there is nothing to
gain and nothing to lose. If anything – <strong>what is lost is an ignorance that
there is something, and a craving that there is not enough</strong> – and that is all
one loses.</p>
<p>Now there are quite a number of synonyms for Nibbāna, such as <em>akata</em> and
<em>asaṅkhata</em>. As already mentioned, there is even a list of thirty-three such
epithets, out of which one is <em>dīpa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">12</a></sup> Now <em>dīpa</em> means an island. When we
are told that Nibbāna is an island, we tend to imagine some sort of existence
in a beautiful island. But in the <em>Pārāyanavagga</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> the
Buddha gives a good corrective to that kind of imagining in his reply to a
question put by the Brahmin youth Kappa, a pupil of Bāvarī. Kappa puts his
question in the following impressive verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>oghe jāte mahabbhaye,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparetānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpaṁ pabrūhi mārisa,</em> <br />
<em>tvañca me dīpam akkhāhi,</em> <br />
<em>yathayidaṁ nāparaṁ siyā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Unto them that stand midstream, <br />
When the frightful floods flow forth, <br />
To them in decay-and-death forlorn, <br />
An island, sire, may you proclaim. <br />
An island which non else excels, <br />
Yea, such an isle, pray tell me sire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Buddha gives his answer in two inspiring verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ,</em> <br />
<em>oghe jāte mahabbhaye,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparetānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>dīpaṁ pabrūmi Kappa te.</em></p>
<p><em>Akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>etaṁ dīpaṁ anāparaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>nibbānaṁ iti naṁ brūmi,</em> <br />
<em>jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Unto them that stand midstream, <br />
When the frightful floods flow forth, <br />
To them in decay-and-death forlorn, <br />
An island, Kappa, I shall proclaim.</p>
<p>Owning naught, grasping naught, <br />
The isle is this, none else besides. <br />
Nibbāna, that is how I call that isle, <br />
Wherein is decay decayed and death is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Akiñcanaṁ</em> means ‘owning nothing’, <em>anādānaṁ</em> means ‘grasping nothing’. <em>Etaṁ
dīpaṁ anāparaṁ</em>, this is the island, nothing else. <em>Nibbānaṁ iti naṁ brūmi,
jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ</em>, “and that I call Nibbāna, which is the extinction of
decay-and-death.”</p>
<p>From this also we can infer that words like <em>akata</em>, <em>asaṅkhata</em> and
<em>sabba-saṅkhārā-samatha</em> are full fledged synonyms of Nibbāna. Nibbāna is
not some mysterious state quite apart from them. It is not something to be
projected into a distance.</p>
<p>Some are in the habit of getting down to a discussion on Nibbāna by putting
<em>saṅkhata</em> on one side and <em>asaṅkhata</em> on the other side. They start by saying
that <em>saṅkhata</em>, or the ‘prepared’, is <em>anicca</em>, or impermanent. If <em>saṅkhata</em>
is <em>anicca</em>, they conclude that <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>nicca</em>, that is the
unprepared must be permanent. Following the same line of argument they argue
that since <em>saṅkhata</em> is <em>dukkha</em>, <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>sukha</em>.</p>
<p>But when they come to the third step, they get into difficulties. If <em>saṅkhata</em>
is <em>anattā</em>, or not-self, then surely <em>asaṅkhata</em> must be <em>attā</em>, or self. At
this point they have to admit that their argument is too facile and so they end
up by saying that after all Nibbāna is something to be realized.</p>
<p>All this confusion arises due to a lack of understanding of the law of Dependent
Arising, <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. Therefore, first of all, we have to say something
about the doctrine of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Ariyapariyesanasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, the Buddha,
soon after his enlightenment, reflected on the profundity of the Dhamma and
was rather disinclined to preach it. He saw two points in the doctrine that are
difficult for the world to see or grasp. One was <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Duddasaṁ idaṁ ṭhānaṁ yadidaṁ idappaccayatā paṭiccasamuppādo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="#fn-fn60">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Hard to see is this point, namely dependent arising which is a relatedness of
this to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the second point was Nibbāna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idampi kho ṭhānaṁ duddasaṁ yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>And this point, too, is difficult to see, namely the stilling of all
preparations, the relinquishment of all assets, the destruction of craving,
detachment, cessation, extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this context we can gather that if there is any term we can use to define
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, a term that comes closer to it in meaning, it is
<em>idappaccayatā</em>. The Buddha himself has described <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> in this
context as a relatedness of this to that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>. As a matter of fact
the basic principle which forms the noble norm of this doctrine of dependent
arising is this <em>idappaccayatā</em>. Let us now try to get at its meaning by
examining the doctrine of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>.</p>
<p>In quite a number of contexts, such as the <em>Bahudhātukasutta</em> of the <em>Majjhima
Nikāya</em> and the <em>Bodhivagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em> the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> is
set out in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassuppādā idaṁ uppajjati</em> <br />
<em>imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,</em> <br />
<em>imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati –</em></p>
<p><em>yadidaṁ avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā, saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṁ, viññāṇapaccayā
nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṁ, saḷāyatanapaccayā phasso,
phassapaccayā vedanā, vedanāpaccayā taṇhā, taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṁ,
upādānapaccayā bhavo, bhavapaccayā jāti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā sambhavanti. Evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti.</em></p>
<p><em>Avijjāyatveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho, saṅkhāranirodhā
viññāṇanirodho, viññāṇanirodhā nāmarūpanirodho, nāmarūpanirodhā
saḷāyatananirodho, saḷāyatananirodhā phassanirodho, phassanirodhā
vedanānirodho, vedanānirodhā taṇhānirodho, taṇhānirodhā upādānanirodho,
upādānanirodhā bhavanirodho, bhavanirodhā jātinirodho, jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇaṁ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā nirujjhanti. Evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn61-1"><a href="#fn-fn61">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus: – This being – this comes to be <br />
With the arising of this – this arises <br />
This not being – this does not come to be <br />
With the cessation of this – this ceases.</p>
<p>And that is to say, dependent on ignorance, preparations come to be;
dependent on preparations, consciousness; dependent on consciousness,
name-and-form; dependent on name-and-form, the six sense-bases; dependent on
the six sense-bases, contact; dependent on contact, feeling; dependent on
feeling, craving; dependent on craving, grasping; dependent on grasping,
becoming; dependent on becoming, birth; dependent on birth, decay-and-death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be. Thus is the arising
of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p>But with the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance, comes the
cessation of preparations; with the cessation of preparations, the cessation
of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, the cessation of
name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, the cessation of the six
sense-bases; with the cessation of the six sense-bases, the cessation of
contact; with the cessation of contact, the cessation of feeling; with the
cessation of feeling, the cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving,
the cessation of grasping; with the cessation of grasping, the cessation of
becoming; with the cessation of becoming, the cessation of birth; with the
cessation of birth, the cessation of decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief and despair cease to be. Thus is the cessation of this entire mass
of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the thematic statement of the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. It is set out
here in the form of a fundamental principle.</p>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti</em>, “this being, this comes to be.”</p>
<p><em>Imassuppādā idaṁ uppajjati,</em> “with the arising of this, this arises.”</p>
<p><em>Imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti</em>, “this not being, this does not come to be”.</p>
<p><em>Imassa nirodhā idaṁ nirujjhati</em>, “with the cessation of this, this ceases.”</p>
<p>It resembles an algebraical formula.</p>
<p>And then we have the conjunctive <em>yadidaṁ</em>, which means ‘namely this’ or ‘that
is to say’. This shows that the foregoing statement is axiomatic and implies
that what follows is an illustration. So the twelve linked formula beginning
with the words <em>avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā</em> is that illustration. No doubt the
twelve-linked formula is impressive enough. But the important thing here is the
basic principle involved, and that is the fourfold statement beginning with
<em>imasmiṁ sati</em>.</p>
<p>This fact is very clearly brought out in a certain sutta in the <em>Nidānavagga</em>
of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. There the Buddha addresses the monks and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭiccasamuppādañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi paṭiccasamuppanne ca
dhamme</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="#fn-fn62">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I will teach you dependent arising and things that are dependently
arisen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular context the Buddha makes a distinction between dependent
arising and things that are dependently arisen. In order to explain what is
meant by dependent arising, or <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, he takes up the last two
links in the formula, in the words: <em>jātipaccayā, bhikkhave, jarāmaraṇaṁ</em>,
“monks, dependent on birth is decay-and-death.”</p>
<p>Then he draws attention to the importance of the basic principle involved:
<em>Uppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ anuppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ, ṭhitā va sā dhātu
dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā idappaccayatā</em> (etc.). Out of the long exhortation
given there, this is the part relevant to us here.</p>
<p><em>Jātipaccayā, bhikkhave, jarāmaraṇaṁ</em>,
“dependent on birth, oh monks, is decay-and-death”,
and that is to say that decay-and-death has birth as its condition.</p>
<p><em>Uppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ anuppādā vā Tathāgatānaṁ</em>, “whether there be
an arising of the <em>Tathāgatās</em> or whether there be no such arising”.</p>
<p><em>Ṭhitā va sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā idappaccayatā</em>, “that elementary nature,
that orderliness of the Dhamma, that norm of the Dhamma, the relatedness of
this to that does stand as it is.”</p>
<p>So from this it is clear that the underlying principle could be understood even
with the help of a couple of links. But the commentary seems to have ignored
this fact in its definition of the term <em>idappaccayatā</em>. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imesaṁ jarāmaraṇādīnaṁ paccayā idappaccayā, idappaccayāva
idappaccayatā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn63-1"><a href="#fn-fn63">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>imesaṁ</em> is in the plural and this indicates that the commentator has
taken the dependence in a collective sense. But it is because of the fact that
even two links are sufficient to illustrate the law, that the Buddha follows it
up with the declaration that this is the <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>. And then he goes
on to explain what is meant by ‘things dependently arisen’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katame ca, bhikkhave, paṭiccasamuppannā dhammā? Jarāmaraṇaṁ, bhikkhave,
aniccaṁ saṇkhataṁ paṭiccasamuppannaṁ khayadhammaṁ vayadhammaṁ virāgadhammaṁ
nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What, monks, are things dependently arisen?” And then, taking up just one of
the last links, he declares: “decay-and-death, monks, is impermanent, prepared,
dependently arisen, of a nature to get destroyed, to pass away, fade away and
cease.”</p>
<p>By the way, the word <em>virāga</em> usually means detachment or dispassion. But in
such contexts as <em>avijjāvirāgā</em> and <em>pītiyā ca virāgā</em> one has to render it by
words like ‘fading away’. So that <em>avijjāvirāga</em> could be rendered as: ‘by the
fading away of ignorance’, and <em>pītiyā virāgā</em> would mean ‘by the fading away of
joy’.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that decay-and-death themselves are impermanent, that they are
prepared or made up, that they are dependently arisen. Decay-and-death
themselves can get destroyed and pass away. Decay as well as death can fade away
and cease.</p>
<p>Then the Buddha takes up the preceding link <em>jāti</em>, or birth. And that too is
given the same qualifications. In the same manner he takes up each of the
preceding links up to and including ignorance, <em>avijjā</em>, and applies to them the
above qualifications. It is significant that every one of the twelve links, even
ignorance, is said to be dependently arisen.</p>
<p>Let us try to understand how, for instance, decay-and-death themselves can get
destroyed or pass away. Taking the <em>idappaccayatā</em> formula as a paradigm, we can
illustrate the relationship between the two links birth and decay-and-death.
Instead of saying: this being, that comes to be (and so forth), now we have to
say: birth being, decay-and-death comes to be. With the arising of birth,
decay-and-death arises. Birth not being, decay-and-death does not come to be.
With the cessation of birth, decay-and-death ceases.</p>
<p>Now birth itself is an arising. But here we can’t help saying that birth
‘arises’. It is like saying that birth is born. How can birth get born?
Similarly death is a passing away. But here we have to say that death itself
‘passes away’. How can death pass away? Perhaps, as we proceed, we might get the
answers to these questions.</p>
<p>Now at this point let us take up for discussion a certain significant passage in
the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. In the course of an exposition of
the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, addressed to Venerable Ānanda, the Buddha
makes the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ettāvatā kho, Ānanda, jāyetha vā jīyetha vā mīyetha vā cavetha vā upapajjetha
vā. Ettāvatā adhivacanapatho, ettāvatā niruttipatho, ettāvatā paññattipatho,
ettāvatā paññāvacaraṁ, ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya yadidaṁ
nāmarūpaṁ saha viññāṇena</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn64-1"><a href="#fn-fn64">18</a></sup></p>
<p>In so far only, Ānanda, can one be born, or grow old, or die, or pass away,
or reappear, in so far only is there any pathway for verbal expression, in so
far only is there any pathway for terminology, in so far only is there any
pathway for designation, in so far only is the range of wisdom, in so far only
is the round kept going for there to be a designation as the this-ness, that
is to say: name-and-form together with consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have rendered the term <em>itthatta</em> by ‘this-ness’, and what it means will
become clear as we go on. In the above quotation the word <em>ettāvatā</em>, which
means ‘in so far only’, has as its point of reference the concluding phrase
<em>yadidaṁ nāmarūpaṁ saha viññāṇena</em>, “that is to say: name-and-form together with
consciousness”.</p>
<p>So the statement, as it is, expresses a complete idea. But some editions have an
additional phrase: <em>aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati</em>, “exists in a mutual
relationship”. This phrase is obviously superfluous and is probably a
commentarial addition.</p>
<p>What is meant by the Buddha’s statement is that name-and-form together with
consciousness is the rallying point for all concepts of birth, decay, death and
rebirth. All pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation
converge on name-and-form together with consciousness. The range of wisdom
extends only up to the relationship between these two. And it is between these
two that there is a whirling round so that one may point out a this-ness. In
short, the secret of the entire <em>saṁsāric</em> existence is to be found in this
whirlpool.</p>
<p><em>Vaṭṭa</em> and <em>āvaṭṭa</em> are words used for a whirlpool. We shall be bringing up
quotations in support of that meaning. It seems, however, that this meaning has
got obscured in the course of time. In the commentaries and in some modern
translations there is quite a lot of confusion with regard to the meaning of the
phrase <em>vaṭṭaṁ vattati</em>. In fact one Sinhala translation renders it as
‘<em>saṁsāric</em> rain’. What rain has to do with <em>saṁsāra</em> is a matter for
conjecture.</p>
<p>What is actually meant by <em>vaṭṭaṁ vattati</em> is a whirling round, and <em>saṁsāra</em>,
even literally, is that. Here we are told that there is a whirling round between
name-and-form and consciousness, and this is the <em>saṁsāric</em> whirlpool to which
all the aforesaid things are traceable.</p>
<p>Already in the first sermon we tried to show that name in name-and-form has to
do with names and concepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="#fn-fn65">19</a></sup> Now from this context it becomes clear that
all pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation converge on this
whirlpool between name-and-form and consciousness.</p>
<p>Now that we have attached so much significance to a whirlpool, let us try to
understand how a whirlpool is formed. Let us try to get at the natural laws
underlying its formation. How does a whirlpool come to be?</p>
<p>Suppose a river is flowing downward. To flow downward is in the nature of a
river. But a certain current of water thinks: “I can and must move upstream.”
And so it pushes on against the main stream. But at a certain point its progress
is checked by the main stream and is thrust aside, only to come round and make a
fresh attempt, again and again.</p>
<p>All these obstinate and unsuccessful attempts gradually lead to a whirling
round. As time goes on, the run-away current understands, as it were, that it
cannot move forward. But it does not give up. It finds an alternative aim in
moving towards the bottom. So it spirals downward, funnel-like, digging deeper
and deeper towards the bottom, until an abyss is formed. Here then we have a
whirlpool.</p>
<p>While all this is going on, there is a crying need to fill up the chasm, and the
whirlpool develops the necessary force of attraction to cater to it. It attracts
and grasps everything that comes within its reach and sends it whirling down,
funnel like, into the chasm. The whirling goes on at a tremendous speed, while
the circumference grows larger and larger. At last the whirlpool becomes a
centre of a tremendous amount of activity.</p>
<p>While this kind of activity is going on in a river or a sea, there is a
possibility for us to point it out as ‘that place’ or ‘this place’. Why? Because
there is an activity going on. Usually, in the world, the place where an
activity is going on is known as a ‘unit’, a ‘centre’, or an ‘institution’.
Since the whirlpool is also a centre of activity, we may designate it as a
‘here’ or ‘there’. We may even personify it. With reference to it, we can open
up pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation.</p>
<p>But if we are to consider the form of activity that is going on here, what is it
after all? It is only a perversion. That obstinate current thought to itself,
out of delusion and ignorance: I can and must move upstream. And so it tried and
failed, but turned round only to make the same vain attempt again and again.
Ironically enough, even its <strong>progress</strong> towards the bottom is a <strong>stagnation</strong>.</p>
<p>So here we have ignorance on one side and craving on the other, as a result of
the abyss formed by the whirlpool. In order to satisfy this craving there is
that power of attraction: grasping. Where there is <strong>grasping</strong>, there is
<strong>existence</strong>, or <strong><em>bhava</em></strong>. The entire whirlpool now appears as a centre of
activity.</p>
<p>Now the basic principle underlying this whirlpool is to be found in our bodies.
What we call ‘breathing’ is a continuous process of emptying and filling up. So
even the so-called ‘life-principle’ is not much different from the activity of a
whirlpool. The functioning of the lungs and the heart is based on the same
principle and the blood circulation is in fact a whirling round. This kind of
activity is very often known as ‘automatic’, a word which has connotations of
<strong>self</strong>-sufficiency. But at the root of it there is a perversion, as we saw in
the case of the whirlpool. All these activities are based on a conflict between
two opposite forces.</p>
<p>In fact existence in its entirety is not much different from the conflict of
that obstinate current of water with the main stream. This characteristic of
conflict is so pervasive that it can be seen even in the basic laws governing
the existence of a society. In our social life, rights and responsibilities go
hand in hand. We can enjoy certain privileges, provided we fulfil our duties. So
here too we have a tangle within and a tangle without.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="#fn-fn66">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Now this is about the existence of the society as such. And what about the field
of economics? There too the basic principles show the same weakness. Production
is governed by laws of supply and demand. There will be a supply so long as
there is a demand. Between them there is a conflict. It leads to many
complications. The price mechanism is on a precarious balance and that is why
some wealthy countries are forced to the ridiculous position of dumping their
surplus into the sea.</p>
<p>All this shows that existence is basically in a precarious position. To
illustrate this, let us take the case of two snakes of the same size, trying to
swallow up each other. Each of them tries to swallow up the other from the tail
upwards and when they are half way through the meal, what do we find? A <strong>snake
cycle</strong>. This snake cycle goes round and round, trying to swallow up each other.
But will it ever be successful?</p>
<p>The precarious position illustrated by the snake cycle, we find in our own
bodies in the form of respiration, blood circulation and so forth. What appears
as the stability in the society and in the economy, is similarly precarious. It
is because of this conflict, this unsatisfactoriness, that the Buddha concluded
that the whole of existence is suffering.</p>
<p>When the arising aspect is taken too seriously, to the neglect of the cessation
aspect, instead of a conflict or an unsatisfactoriness one tends to see
something automatic everywhere. This body as well as machines such as water
pumps and electrical appliances seem to work on an automatic principle. But in
truth there is only a conflict between two opposing forces. When one comes to
think of it, there is no ‘<strong>auto</strong>’-ness even in the automatic.</p>
<p>All that is there, is a bearing up with difficulty. And this in fact is the
meaning of the word <em>dukkha</em>. <em>Duḥ</em> stands for ‘difficulty’ and <em>kha</em> for
‘bearing up’. <strong>Even with difficulty one bears it up, and though one bears it
up, it is difficult</strong>.</p>
<p>Now regarding the question of existence we happened to mention that because of a
whirlpool’s activity, one can point out a ‘<strong>here</strong>’ with reference to it. We
can now come back to the word <em>itthattaṁ</em>, which we left out without comment in
the quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya</em></p>
<p>in so far only does the whirlpool whirl for the designation of an <em>itthatta.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what is this <em>itthatta</em>? <em>Ittha</em> means ‘this’, so <em>itthattaṁ</em> would mean
‘this-ness’. The whirling of a whirlpool qualifies itself for a designation as a
‘this’.</p>
<p>There are a couple of verses in the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> of the <em>Sutta
Nipāta</em> which bring out the meaning of this word more clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>ye vajanti punappunaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>avijjāyeva sā gati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="#fn-fn67">21</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Taṇhā dutiyo puriso,</em> <br />
<em>dīgham addhāna saṁsāraṁ,</em> <br />
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>saṁsāraṁ nātivattati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="#fn-fn68">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ye jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ punappunaṁ vajanti</em>,
“they that go on again and again the round of birth and death”.</p>
<p><em>Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ</em> “which is a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”, or “which
is an alternation between a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”.</p>
<p><em>Sā gati avijjāya eva</em>, “that going of them, that faring of them, is only a
journey of ignorance.”</p>
<p><em>Taṇhā dutiyo puriso</em>, “the man with craving as his second” (or his companion).</p>
<p><em>Dīgham addhāna saṁsāraṁ</em>, “faring on for a long time in <em>saṁsāra</em>”.</p>
<p><em>Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṁ, saṁsāraṁ nātivattati</em>, “does not get away from the
round which is a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”, or “which is an alternation
between a this-ness and an otherwise-ness”. What is meant by it, is the
transcendence of <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>We saw above how the concept of a ‘here’ arose with the birth of a whirlpool. In
fact one’s birth is at the same time the birth of a ‘here’ or ‘this place’. And
that is what is meant by <em>itthabhāva</em> in the two verses quoted above.
<em>Itthabhāva</em> and <em>itthatta</em> both mean ‘this-ness’. In both verses this
‘this-ness’ is coupled with an otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāva</em>.</p>
<p>Here too we see a conflict between two things, this-ness and otherwise-ness. The
cycle of <em>saṁsāra</em>, represented by birth and death, <em>jāti maraṇa saṁsāraṁ</em>, is
equivalent to an alternation between this-ness and otherwise-ness,
<em>itthabhāvaññathābhāva</em>. And as the first verse says, this recurrent alternation
between this-ness and otherwise-ness is nothing but a journey of ignorance
itself.</p>
<p>Though we have given so much significance to the two terms <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, the commentary to the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em> treats them lightly. It
explains <em>itthabhāvaṁ</em> as <em>imaṁ manussabhāvaṁ</em>, which means “this state as a
human being”, and <em>aññathābhāvaṁ</em> as <em>ito avasesa aññanikāyabhāvaṁ</em>, “any state
of being other than this”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="#fn-fn69">23</a></sup> This explanation misses the deeper
significance of the word <em>itthatta</em>.</p>
<p>In support of this we may refer to the <em>Pāṭikasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.
There we are told that when the world system gets destroyed at the end of an
aeon, some being or other gets reborn in an empty Brahma mansion, and after
being there for a long time, thinks, out of a feeling of loneliness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aho vata aññepi sattā itthattaṁ āgaccheyyuṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="#fn-fn70">24</a></sup></p>
<p>How nice it would be if other beings also come to this state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context the word <em>itthatta</em> refers to the Brahma world and not the human
world. From the point of view of the Brahmas, <em>itthatta</em> refers to the Brahma
world and only for us here, it means the human world.</p>
<p>However this is just a narrow meaning of the word <em>itthatta</em>. When the reference
is to the entire round of existence or <em>saṁsāra</em>, <em>itthatta</em> does not
necessarily mean ‘this human world’. The two terms have a generic sense, because
they represent some basic principle. As in the case of a whirlpool, this-ness is
to be seen together with an otherwise-ness. This illustrates the conflict
characteristic of existence. Wherever a this-ness arises, a possibility for an
otherwise-ness comes in. <em>Itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññathābhāva</em> go together.</p>
<p><em>Aniccatā</em>, or impermanence, is very often explained with the help of the phrase
<em>vipariṇāmaññathābhāva</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="#fn-fn71">25</a></sup> Now here too we have the word <em>aññathābhāva</em>.
Here the word preceding it, gives a clue to its true significance.</p>
<p><em>Vipariṇāma</em> is quite suggestive of a process of evolution. Strictly speaking,
<em>pariṇāma</em> is evolution, and <em>pariṇata</em> is the fully evolved or mature stage.
The prefix <em>vi</em> stands for the anti-climax. The evolution is over, now it is
becoming other. Ironically enough, this state of ‘becoming-other’ is known as
otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāva</em>. And so this twin, <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, tell us the nature of the world. Between them, they explain for
us the law of impermanence.</p>
<p>In the Section-of-the-Threes in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em> the three characteristics
of a <em>saṅkhata</em> are explained in this order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṁ paññāyati</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="#fn-fn72">26</a></sup></p>
<p>an arising is manifest, a passing away is manifest and an otherwise-ness in
the persisting is manifest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that the persistence is only apparent and that is why it is
mentioned last. There is an otherwise-ness even in this apparently persistent.
But later scholars preferred to speak of three stages as <em>uppāda, ṭhiti,
bhaṅga</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="#fn-fn73">27</a></sup> “arising, persistence and breaking up”.</p>
<p>However the law of impermanence could be sufficiently understood even with the
help of two words, <em>itthabhāva</em> and <em>aññathābhāva</em>, this-ness and
otherwise-ness. Very often we find the Buddha summing up the law of impermanence
in the two words <em>samudaya</em> and <em>vaya</em>, ‘arising’ and ‘passing away’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="#fn-fn74">28</a></sup></p>
<p>There is an apparent contradiction in the phrase <em>ṭhitassa aññathatta</em>, but it
reminds us of the fact that what the world takes as static or persisting is
actually not so. The so-called ‘static’ is from beginning to end an
otherwise-ness. Now if we are to relate this to the two links <em>jāti</em> and
<em>jarāmaraṇaṁ</em> in <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, we may say that as soon as one is born the
process of otherwise-ness sets in. Wherever there is birth, there is death. One
of the traditional Pāli verses on the reflections on death has the following
meaningful lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Uppattiyā sahevedaṁ, maraṇam āgataṁ sadā</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="#fn-fn75">29</a></sup></p>
<p>always death has come, even with the birth itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as in a conjoined pair, when one is drawn the other follows, even so when
birth is drawn in, decay-and-death follow as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Buddha, the world believed in the possibility of a
birth devoid of decay-and-death. It believed in a form of existence devoid of
grasping. Because of its ignorance of the pair-wise relatedness of this-to-that,
<em>idappaccayatā</em>, it went on with its deluded search. And that was the reason for
all the conflict in the world.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the Buddha, the concept of birth is equivalent to
the concept of a ‘here’. As a matter of fact, this birth of a ‘here’ is like the
first peg driven for the measurement of a world. Because of the pair-wise
relationship, the very first ‘<strong>birthday-present</strong>’ that one gets as soon as one
is born, is – <strong>death</strong>. The inevitable death that he is entitled to. This way
we can understand the deeper significance of the two words <em>itthabhāva</em> and
<em>aññathābhāva</em>, this-ness and otherwise-ness.</p>
<p>We have to say the same thing with regard to the whirlpool. Apparently it has
the power to control, to hold sway. Seen from a distance, the whirlpool is a
centre of activity with some controlling power. Now, one of the basic meanings
of the concept of self is the ability to control, to hold sway. And a whirlpool
too, as seen from a distance, seems to have this ability. Just as it appears
automatic, so also it seems to have some power to control.</p>
<p>But on deeper analysis it reveals its <strong>not-self</strong> nature. What we have here is
simply the conflict between the main stream and a run-away current. It is the
outcome of the conflict between two forces and not the work of just one force.
It is a case of relatedness of this-to-that, <em>idappaccayatā</em>. As one verse in
the <em>Bālavagga</em> of the <em>Dhammapada</em> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attā hi attano natthi</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="#fn-fn76">30</a></sup></p>
<p>even oneself is not one’s own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So even a whirlpool is not its own</strong>, there is nothing really automatic about
it. This then is the <em>dukkha</em>, the suffering, the conflict, the
unsatisfactoriness. What the world holds on to as existence is just a process of
otherwise-ness, as the Buddha vividly portrays for us in the following verses of
the <em>Nandavagga</em> of the <em>Udāna</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ayaṁ loko santāpajāto, phassapareto</em> <br />
<em>rogaṁ vadati attato,</em> <br />
<em>yena yena hi maññati,</em> <br />
<em>tato taṁ hoti aññathā.</em></p>
<p><em>Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko,</em> <br />
<em>bhavapareto bhavam evābhinandati,</em> <br />
<em>yad’abhinandati taṁ bhayaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>yassa bhāyati taṁ dukkhaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>bhava vippahānāya kho panidaṁ brahmacariyaṁ vussati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn77-1"><a href="#fn-fn77">31</a></sup></p>
<p>This anguished world, fully given to contact, <br />
Speaks of a disease as self. <br />
In whatever terms it conceives of, <br />
Even thereby it turns otherwise.</p>
<p>The world, attached to becoming, given fully to becoming, <br />
Though becoming otherwise, yet delights in becoming. <br />
What it delights in is a fear <br />
What it fears from is a suffering. <br />
But then this holy life is lived for the abandoning of that very becoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Just a few lines – but how deep they go!</strong> The world is in anguish and is
enslaved by contact. What it calls self is nothing but a disease.</p>
<p><em>Maññati</em> is a word of deeper significance. <em>Maññanā</em> is conceiving under the
influence of craving, conceit and views. Whatever becomes an object of that
conceiving, by that very conception it becomes otherwise. That is to say that an
opportunity arises for an otherwise-ness, even as ‘death’ has come together with
‘birth’.</p>
<p>So conceiving, or conception, is itself the reason for otherwise-ness. Before a
‘<strong>thing</strong>’ becomes ‘<strong>otherwise</strong>’, it has to become a ‘<strong>thing</strong>’. And it
becomes a ‘thing’ only when attention is focussed on it under the influence of
craving, conceit and views and it is separated from the whole world and grasped
as a ‘<strong>thing’</strong>. And that is why it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ yañhi lokasmim upādiyanti,</em> <br />
<em>teneva Māro anveti jantuṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="#fn-fn78">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever one grasps in the world, <br />
By that itself Māra pursues a being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world is attached to becoming and is fully given to becoming. Therefore its
very nature is otherwise-ness, <em>aññathābhāvī</em>.</p>
<p>And then the Buddha declares the inevitable outcome of this contradictory
position: <em>yad abhinandati taṁ bhayaṁ</em>, whatever one delights in, that is a
fear, that is a danger. What one delights in, is ‘becoming’ and that is a source
of fear. And <em>yassa bhāyati taṁ dukkhaṁ</em>, what one fears, or is afraid of, that
is suffering. And of what is one afraid? One is afraid of the otherwise-ness of
the thing that one holds on to as existing. So the otherwise-ness is the
suffering and the thing grasped is a source of fear.</p>
<p>For instance, when one is walking through a town with one’s pockets full of
gems, one is afraid because of the valuables in one’s pockets. Even so, the
existence that one delights in is a source of fear. What one fears is change or
otherwise-ness, and that is suffering. Therefore it is that this holy life is
lived for the abandonment of that very becoming or existence.</p>
<p>So from this quotation it becomes clear that the nature of existence is
‘otherwise-ness’. It is the insight into this nature that is basic in the
understanding of <em>idappaccayatā</em>. What is known as the arising of the
Dhamma-eye is the understanding of this predicament in worldly existence. But
that Dhamma-eye arises together with a solution for this predicament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ sabbaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="#fn-fn79">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as the arising aspect is concerned, this whirlpool is formed due to the
grasping through craving, conceit and views. Once this <em>saṁsāric</em> whirlpool is
formed, it keeps on attracting all that is in the world, all that is within its
reach, in the form of craving and grasping. But there is a cessation to this
process. It is possible to make it cease. Why? Because it is something arisen
due to causes and conditions. Because it is a process based on two things,
without a self to hold sway. That is why we have mentioned at the very outset
that everything is impermanent, prepared and dependently arisen, <em>aniccaṁ,
saṅkhataṁ, paṭicca samuppannaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>Everyone of the twelve links in the formula, including ignorance, is dependently
arisen. They are all arisen due to causes and conditions, they are not
permanent, <em>aniccaṁ</em>. They are only made up or prepared, <em>saṅkhataṁ</em>. The word
<em>saṅkhataṁ</em> is explained in various ways. But in short it means something that
is made up, prepared, or concocted by way of intention.</p>
<p><em>Paṭicca samuppannaṁ</em> means conditionally arisen and therefore it is of a nature
to get destroyed, <em>khayadhamma</em>. It is of a nature to pass away, <em>vayadhamma</em>.
It is of a nature to fade away, <em>virāgadhamma</em>. It is of a nature to cease,
<em>nirodhadhamma</em>.</p>
<p>It seems that even the colour or shade of decay-and-death can fade away and that
is why we have pointed out their relevance to the question of concepts. This
nature of fading away is understood by one who has had an insight into the law
of arising and cessation.</p>
<p><em>Saṁsāra</em> is a whirlpool as far as the ordinary beings caught up in it are
concerned. Now what about the <em>arahants</em>? How is the idea of this whirlpool
presented in the case of the <em>arahants</em>? It is simply said that for them there
is no whirling round for there to be a designation: <em>vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi
paññāpanāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn80-1"><a href="#fn-fn80">34</a></sup> So in their case, there is no whirling round to justify a
designation.</p>
<p>This, then, is something deeper than the whirlpool itself. The whirlpool can be
pointed out because of its activity. But not so easily the emancipated ones and
that is why there is so much controversy regarding the nature of the
Tathāgata. The image of the whirlpool in its relation to the emancipated ones
is beautifully presented in the following verse from the <em>Cūḷavagga</em> of the
<em>Udāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Acchecchi vaṭṭaṁ byagā nirāsaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>visukkhā saritā na sandati,</em> <br />
<em>chinnaṁ vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>es’ ev’ anto dukkhassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="#fn-fn81">35</a></sup></p>
<p>He has cut off the whirlpool <br />
And reached desirelessness, <br />
The stream dried up now no longer flows. <br />
The whirlpool cut off whirls no more. <br />
This, even this, is suffering’s end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has the <em>arahant</em> done? He has cut off the whirlpool. He has breached it
and has reached the desireless state. The stream of craving is dried up and
flows no more. The whirlpool cut off at the root no more whirls. And this is the
end of suffering. The cutting off of the whirlpool is the realization of
cessation, which is <em>arahanthood</em>.</p>
<p>It is because of the accent on the arising aspect that the current tries to move
against the main stream. When that attempt is given up, the rest happens as a
matter of course. This idea is even more clearly brought out by the following
two verses in the <em>Sagāthavagga</em> of the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em>. They are in the form
of a dialogue between a deity and the Buddha. The deity asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kuto sarā nivattanti,</em> <br />
<em>kattha vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>kattha nāmañca rūpañca</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati?</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn82-1"><a href="#fn-fn82">36</a></sup></p>
<p>From where do currents turn back, <br />
Where whirls no more the whirlpool, <br />
Where is it that name-and-form <br />
Is held in check in a way complete?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha gives the answer in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yattha āpo ca paṭhavī,</em> <br />
<em>tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em> <br />
<em>ato sarā nivattanti,</em> <br />
<em>ettha vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> <br />
<em>ettha nāmañca rūpañca,</em> <br />
<em>asesaṁ uparujjhati</em>.</p>
<p>Where earth and water, fire and wind no footing find, <br />
From there it is that currents turn back. <br />
There the whirlpool whirls no more <br />
And there it is that name-and-form <br />
Is held in check in a way complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference here is to Nibbāna. Whether it is called <em>sabbasaṅkhārasamatha</em>,
the stilling of all preparations, or <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>, the unprepared element,
it means the state of cessation. And when the <em>arahant’s</em> mind is in that state,
the four elements, which are like ghosts, do not haunt him. They do not get a
‘<strong>footing</strong>’ in that consciousness. When they fade away, due to detachment,
those currents do not flow and the whirlpool whirls no more. Name and form are
fully held in check there.</p>
<p>Now as far as the meaning of <em>rūpa</em> in <em>nāma-rūpa</em> in this reference is
concerned, its definition as <em>cattāri ca mahābhūtāni, catunnañca mahābhūtānaṁ
upādāyarūpaṁ</em> is quite significant .<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="#fn-fn83">37</a></sup> It draws attention to the fact that
the four great primaries underlie the concept of form. This is something unique,
since before the advent of the Buddha the world thought that in order to get
away from <em>rūpa</em> one has to grasp <em>arūpa</em>. But the irony of the situation is
that, even in <em>arūpa</em>, <em>rūpa</em> is implicit in a subtle form. Or in other words,
<em>arūpa</em> takes <em>rūpa</em> for granted.</p>
<p>Supposing someone, walking in the darkness of the night, has a hallucination of
a devil and runs away to escape from it. He thinks he is running away from the
devil, but he is taking the devil with him. The devil is in his mind, it is
something imagined. Similarly, until the Buddha came into the scene, the
worldlings grasped <em>arūpa</em> in order to get away from <em>rūpa</em>. But because of the
dichotomy between <em>rūpa</em> and <em>arūpa</em>, even when they swung as far as the highest
formless realms, they were still in bondage to <em>saṅkhāras</em>, or preparations. As
soon as the momentum of their swing of <em>saṅkhāras</em> got fully spent, they swung
back to <em>rūpa</em>. So here too we see the question of duality and dichotomy.</p>
<p>This sermon has served its purpose if it has drawn attention to the importance
of the questions of duality, dichotomy and the relatedness of this to that,
<em>idappaccayatā</em>. So this is enough for today.</p>
