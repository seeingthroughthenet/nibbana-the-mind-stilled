</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the thirteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In our last sermon we attempted an exposition under the topic
<em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāya</em>, “the basic pattern of behaviour of all mind objects”,
which constitutes the theme of the very first sutta of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>,
namely the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>We happened to mention that the discourse describes three different attitudes
regarding twenty-four concepts such as earth, water, fire and air. We could
however discuss only two of them the other day, namely the world view, or the
attitude of the untaught ordinary person, and the attitude of the noble one, who
is in higher training.</p>
<p>So today, to begin with, let us bring up the third type of attitude given in the
discourse, that is, the attitude of <em>arahants</em> and that of the Tathāgata, both
being similar. It is described in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhijānāti, paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ na
maññati, paṭhaviyā na maññati, paṭhavito na maññati, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti na
maññati, paṭhaviṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? ’Pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn439-1"><a href="#fn-fn439">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>arahant</em> (as well as the Tathāgata) understands through higher knowledge
earth as ‘earth’, having understood through higher knowledge earth as ‘earth’,
he does not imagine earth to be ‘earth’, he does not imagine ‘on the earth’,
he does not imagine ‘from the earth’, he does not imagine ‘earth is mine’, he
does not delight in earth. Why is that? I say, it is because it has been well
comprehended by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us now try to compare and contrast these three attitudes, so that we can
understand them in greater detail. The attitude of the untaught ordinary person
in regard to any of the twenty-four concepts like earth, water, fire, air (the
twenty-four cited being illustrations), is so oriented that he perceives it as
such.</p>
<p>For instance in the case of earth, he perceives a real earth, that is, takes it
as earth per se. It may sometimes be only a block of ice, but because it is hard
to the touch, he grasps it as ‘earth’. Thus the ordinary person, the worldling,
relies only on perception in his pursuit of knowledge. Having perceived earth as
‘earth’, he imagines it to be ‘earth’. The peculiarity of <em>maññanā</em>, or
‘me’-thinking, is that it is an imagining in terms of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.</p>
<p>So he first imagines it as ‘earth’, then he imagines ‘on the earth’, ‘from the
earth’, ‘earth is mine’ and delights in the earth. Here we find various
flexional forms known to grammar.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, grammar itself is a product of the worldlings for purposes
of transaction in ideas bound up with defilements. Its purpose is to enable
beings, who are overcome by the personality view, to communicate with their
like-minded fellow beings. Grammar, therefore, is something that caters to their
needs. As such, it embodies certain misconceptions, some of which have been
highlighted in this context.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>paṭhaviṁ maññati</em> could be interpreted as an attempt to imagine
an earth – as a full-fledged noun or substantive. It is conceived as something
substantial. By <em>paṭhaviyā maññāti</em>, “he imagines ‘on the earth’”, the locative
case is implied; while <em>’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati</em>, “he imagines ‘earth is mine’”,
is an instance of the genitive case, expressing the idea of possession.</p>
<p>Due to such imaginings, a reality is attributed to the concept of ‘earth’ and
its existence is taken for granted. In other words, these various forms of
imaginings go to confirm the notion already aroused by the concept of ‘earth’.
Once it is confirmed one can delight in it, <em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em>. This, then,
is the worldview of the untaught ordinary person.</p>
<p>The other day we mentioned that the monk who is in higher training understands
through higher knowledge, not through perception, earth as ‘earth’. Though it is
a higher level of understanding, he is not totally free from imaginings. That is
why certain peculiar expressions are used in connection with him, such as
<em>paṭaviṁ mā maññi, paṭhaviyā mā maññi, paṭhavito mā maññi, ’paṭhaviṁ me’ti mā
maññi, paṭhaviṁ mā abhinandi.</em></p>
<p>Here we have to call in question the commentarial explanation. According to the
commentary, this peculiar expression had to be used as a dilly dally phrase,
because the monk in higher training could not be said to imagine or not
imagine.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn440-1"><a href="#fn-fn440">3</a></sup> But it is clear enough that the particle <em>mā</em> in this context
is used in its prohibitive sense. <em>Mā maññi</em> means “do not imagine!”, and <em>mā
abhinandi</em> means “do not delight!”.</p>
<p>What is significant about the <em>sekha</em>, the monk in higher training, is that he
is in a stage of voluntary training. In fact, the word <em>sekha</em> literally means a
‘learner’. That is to say, he has obtained a certain degree of higher
understanding but has not attained as yet full comprehension.</p>
<p>It is precisely for that reason that the section about him is summed up by the
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṁ kissa hetu? Pariññeyyaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi.</em></p>
<p>Why is that? Because, I say, that it should be comprehended by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since he has yet to comprehend it, he is following that course of higher
training. The particle <em>mā</em> is therefore a pointer to that effect. For example,
<em>mā maññi</em> “do not imagine!”, <em>mā abhinandi</em> “do not delight!”.</p>
<p>In other words, the monk in higher training cannot help using the grammatical
structure in usage among the worldlings and as his latencies are not extinct as
yet, he has to practise a certain amount of restraint. By constant employment of
mindfulness and wisdom he makes an attempt to be immune to the influence of the
worldling’s grammatical structure.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that he would be carried away by the implications of such
concepts as earth, water, fire and air, in his communications with the world
regarding them. So he strives to proceed towards full comprehension with the
help of the higher understanding already won, keeping mindfulness and wisdom
before him. That is the voluntary training implied here.</p>
<p>The monk in higher training is called <em>attagutto</em>, in the sense that he tries to
guard himself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn441-1"><a href="#fn-fn441">4</a></sup> Such phrases like <em>mā maññi</em> indicate that voluntary
training in guarding himself. Here we had to add something more to the
commentarial explanation. So this is the situation with the monk in higher
training.</p>
<p>Now as to the <em>arahant</em> and the Tathāgata, the world views of both are
essentially the same. That is to say, they both have a higher knowledge as well
as a full comprehension with regard to the concept of earth, for instance.
<em>Pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi</em>, “I say it has been comprehended by him”.</p>
<p>As such, they are not carried away by the implications of the worldlings’
grammatical structure. They make use of the worldly usage much in the same way
as parents do when they are speaking in their child’s language. They are not
swept away by it. There is no inner entanglement in the form of imagining. There
is no attachment, entanglement and involvement by way of craving, conceit and
view, in regard to those concepts.</p>
<p>All this goes to show the immense importance of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>. One can
understand why this sutta came to be counted as the first among the suttas of
the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>. It is as if this sutta was intended to serve as the
alphabet in deciphering the words used by the Buddha in his sermons delivered in
discursive style. As a matter of fact the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em> in particular is a
text abounding in deep suttas. This way we can understand why both higher
knowledge and full comprehension are essential.</p>
<p>We have shown above that this discourse bears some relation to the grammatical
structure. Probably due to a lack of recognition of this relationship between
the modes of imagining and the grammatical structure, the commentators were
confronted with a problem while commenting upon this discourse.</p>
<p>Such phrases as <em>paṭhaviṁ maññati</em> and <em>paṭhaviyā maññati</em> occur all over this
discourse in referring to various ways of imagining. The commentator, however,
always makes it a point to interpret these ways of imagining with reference to
craving, conceit and views. So when he comes to the phrase <em>mā abhinandi</em>, he
finds it to be superfluous. That is why Venerable Buddhaghosa treats it as a
repetition and poses a possible question as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Paṭhaviṁ maññatī’ti’ eteneva etasmiṁ atthe siddhe kasmā evaṁ vuttanti ce.
Avicāritaṁ etaṁ porāṇehi. Ayaṁ pana me attano mati, desanāvilāsato vā
ādīnavadassanato vā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn442-1"><a href="#fn-fn442">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is how the commentator poses his own problem: When the phrase <em>paṭhaviṁ
maññati</em> by itself fulfils the purpose, why is it that an additional phrase like
<em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em> is brought in? That is to say, if the imagining already
implies craving, conceit and views, what is the justification for the concluding
phrase <em>paṭhaviṁ abhinandati</em>, “he delights in earth”, since craving already
implies a form of delighting?</p>
<p>So he takes it as a repetition and seeks for a justification. He confesses that
the ancients have not handed down an explanation and offers his own personal
opinion on it, <em>ayaṁ pana me attano mati,</em> “but then this is my own opinion”.</p>
<p>And what does his own explanation amount to? <em>Desanāvilāsato vā ādīnavadassanato
vā</em>, “either as a particular style in preaching, or by way of showing the perils
of the ways of imagining”. He treats it as yet another way of preaching peculiar
to the Buddha, or else as an attempt to emphasize the perils of imagining.</p>
<p>However, going by the explanation we have already given above, relating these
modes of imagining to the structure of grammar, we can come to a conclusion as
to why the phrase <em>mā abhinandi</em> was brought in.</p>
<p>The reason is that each of those concepts crystallized into a real thing as a
result of imagining, based on the framework of grammar. It received real object
status in the world of imagination. Once its object status got confirmed, one
can certainly delight in it. It became a thing in truth and fact. The purpose of
these ways of imagining is to mould it into a thing.</p>
<p>Let us go deeper into this problem. There is, for instance, a certain recurrent
passage in the discourses on the subject of sense restraint.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn443-1"><a href="#fn-fn443">6</a></sup> The gist of
that passage amounts to this: A person with defilements takes in signs and
features through all the six sense doors, inclusive of the mind.</p>
<p>Due to that grasping at signs and features, various kinds of influxes are said
to flow in, according to the passages outlining the practice of sense restraint.
From this we can well infer that the role of <em>maññanā</em>, or imagining, is to
grasp at signs with regard to the objects of the mind.</p>
<p>That is to say, the mind apperceives its object as ‘something’, <em>dhammasaññā</em>.
The word <em>dhamma</em> in the opening sentence of this sutta,
<em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi</em>, means a ‘thing’, since
every-thing is an object of the mind in the last analysis.</p>
<p><em>Paṭhaviṁ maññati</em>, “he imagines earth as earth”, is suggestive of a grasping at
the sign in regard to objects of the mind. Thinking in such terms as <em>paṭhaviyā
maññati, paṭhavito maññāti</em>, and <em>’paṭhaviṁ me’ti maññati</em>, “he imagines ‘on the
earth’, he imagines ‘from the earth’, he imagines ‘earth is mine’”, are like the
corroborative features that go to confirm that sign already grasped.</p>
<p>The two terms <em>nimitta,</em> sign, and <em>anuvyañjana</em>, feature, in the context of
sense restraint have to be understood in this way. Now the purpose of a
<em>nimitta</em>, or sign, is to give a hazy idea like ‘this may be so’.</p>
<p>It receives confirmation with the help of corroborative features, <em>anuvyañjana</em>,
all the features that are accessory to the sign. The corroboration comes, for
instance, in this manner: ‘This goes well with this, this accords with this,
therefore the sign I took is right’. So even on the basis of instructions on
sense restraint, we can understand the special significance of this <em>maññanā</em>,
or ‘me’-thinking.</p>
<p>The reason for the occurrence of these different ways of me-thinking can also be
understood. In this discourse the Buddha is presenting a certain philosophy of
the grammatical structure. The structure of grammar is a contrivance for
conducting the worldlings’ thought process, characterised by the perception of
permanence, as well as for communication of ideas arising out of that process.</p>
<p>The grammatical structure invests words with life, as it were. This mode of
hypostasizing is revealed in the nouns and substantives implying such notions as
‘in it’, ‘by it’ and ‘from it’. The last of the flexional forms, the vocative
case, <em>he paṭhavi</em>, “hey earth”, effectively illustrates this hypostasizing
character of grammar. It is even capable of infusing life into the concept of
‘earth’ and arousing it with the words “hey earth”.</p>
<p>In an earlier sermon we had occasion to refer to a legend in which a tiger was
reconstituted and resurrected out of its skeletal remains.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn444-1"><a href="#fn-fn444">7</a></sup> The structure
of grammar seems to be capable of a similar feat. The <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> gives
us an illustration of this fact.</p>
<p>It is because of the obsessional character of this <em>maññanā</em>, or me-thinking,
that the Buddha has presented this <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> to the world as the basic
pattern or paradigm representing three types of world views, or the world views
of three types of persons.</p>
<p>This discourse deals with the untaught ordinary person, who is obsessed by this
grammatical structure, the disciple in higher training, who is trying to free
himself from its grip, and the emancipated one, completely free from it, at the
same time giving their respective world views as well.</p>
<p>The other day we enumerated the list of twenty-four concepts, presented in that
discourse. Out of these concepts, we have to pay special attention to the fact
that Nibbāna is counted as the last, since it happens to be the theme of all our
sermons.</p>
<p>Regarding this concept of Nibbāna too, the worldling is generally tempted to
entertain some kind of <em>maññanā</em>, or me-thinking. Even some philosophers are
prone to that habit. They indulge in some sort of prolific conceptualisation and
me-thinking on the basis of such conventional usages as ‘in Nibbāna’, ‘from
Nibbāna’, ‘on reaching Nibbāna’ and ‘my Nibbāna’. By hypostasizing Nibbāna they
develop a substance view, even of this concept, just as in the case of
<em>paṭhavi</em>, or earth. Let us now try to determine whether this is justifiable.</p>
<p>The primary sense of the word Nibbāna is ‘extinction’, or ‘extinguishment’. We
have already discussed this point with reference to such contexts as
<em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn445-1"><a href="#fn-fn445">8</a></sup> In that discourse the Buddha explained the term
Nibbāna to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta with the help of a simile of the
extinction of a fire. Simply because a fire is said to go out, one should not
try to trace it, wondering where it has gone.</p>
<p>The term Nibbāna is essentially a verbal noun. We also came across the phrase
<em>nibbuto tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em>, “it is reckoned as ‘extinguished’”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn446-1"><a href="#fn-fn446">9</a></sup></p>
<p>As we have already pointed out in a previous sermon, <em>saṅkhā</em>, <em>samaññā</em> and
<em>paññatti</em>, ‘reckoning’, ‘appellation’ and ‘designation’ are more or less
synonymous.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn447-1"><a href="#fn-fn447">10</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Saṅkhaṁ gacchati</em> only means “comes to be reckoned”. Nibbāna is therefore some
sort of reckoning, an appellation or designation. The word Nibbāna, according to
the <em>Aggivacchagottasutta</em>, is a designation or a concept.</p>
<p>But the commentator takes much pains to prove that the Nibbāna mentioned at the
end of the list in the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> refers not to our orthodox Nibbāna,
but to a concept of Nibbāna upheld by heretics.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn448-1"><a href="#fn-fn448">11</a></sup> The commentator, it
seems, is at pains to salvage our Nibbāna, but his attempt is at odds with the
trend of this discourse, because the <em>sekha</em>, or the monk in higher training,
has no need to train himself in refraining from delighting in any heretical
Nibbāna. So here too, the reference is to our orthodox Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Presumably the commentator could not understand why the <em>arahants</em> do not
delight in Nibbāna. For instance, in the section on the Tathāgata one reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nibbānaṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? Nandi dukkhassa mūlan’ti iti viditvā,
bhavā jāti, bhūtassa jarāmaraṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>He does not delight in Nibbāna. Why so? Because he knows that delighting is
the root of suffering, and from becoming comes birth and to the one become
there is decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems, then, that the Tathāgata does not delight in Nibbāna, because
delighting is the root of suffering. Now <em>nandi</em> is a form of grasping,
<em>upādāna</em>, impelled by craving. It is sometimes expressly called an <em>upādāna</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā vedanāsu nandi tadupādānaṁ,</em></p>
<p>whatever delighting there is in feeling, that is a grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn449-1"><a href="#fn-fn449">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where there is delighting, there is a grasping. Where there is grasping, there
is <em>bhava</em>, becoming or existence. From becoming comes birth, and to the one who
has thus come to be there is decay-and-death.</p>
<p>It is true that we project the concept of Nibbāna as an objective to aim at in
our training. But if we grasp it like the concept of earth and start indulging
in me-thinkings or imaginings about it, we would never be able to realize it.
Why? Because what we have here is an extraordinary path leading to an
emancipation from all concepts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nissāya nissāya oghassa nittharaṇā,</em></p>
<p>“crossing over the flood with relative dependence”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn450-1"><a href="#fn-fn450">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever is necessary is made use of, but there is no grasping in terms of
craving, conceits and views. That is why even with reference to the Tathāgata
the phrase <em>Nibbānaṁ nābhinandati</em>, “he does not delight in Nibbāna”, occurs in
this discourse.</p>
<p>One might ask: “What is wrong in delighting in Nibbāna?” But then we might
recall a pithy dialogue already quoted in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn451-1"><a href="#fn-fn451">14</a></sup> A deity
comes and accosts the Buddha: “Do you rejoice, recluse?” And the Buddha
responds: “On getting what, friend?” Then the deity asks: “Well then, recluse,
do you grieve?” And the Buddha retorts: “On losing what, friend?” The deity now
mildly remarks: “So then, recluse, you neither rejoice nor grieve!” And the
Buddha confirms it with the assent: “That is so, friend.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn452-1"><a href="#fn-fn452">15</a></sup></p>
<p>This then is the attitude of the Buddha and the <em>arahants</em> to the concept of
Nibbāna. There is nothing to delight in it, only equanimity is there.</p>
<p>Seen in this perspective, the word Nibbāna mentioned in the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>
need not be taken as referring to a concept of Nibbāna current among heretics.
The reference here is to our own orthodox Nibbāna concept. But the attitude
towards it must surely be changed in the course of treading the path to it.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, one grasps it tenaciously and takes it to be substantial,
presuming that the word is a full fledged noun, and goes on to argue it out on
the basis of logic and proliferate on it conceptually, it will no longer be our
Nibbāna. There one slips into wrong view. One would never be able to extricate
oneself from wrong view that way. Here then is an issue of crucial importance.</p>
<p>Many philosophers start their exposition with an implicit acceptance of
conditionality. But when they come to the subject of Nibbāna, they have recourse
to some kind of instrumentality. “On reaching Nibbāna, lust and delight are
abandoned.”<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn453-1"><a href="#fn-fn453">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Commentators resort to such explanations under the influence of <em>maññanā</em>. They
seem to imply that Nibbāna is instrumental in quenching the fires of defilement.
To say that the fires of defilements are quenched by Nibbāna, or on arriving at
it, is to get involved in a circular argument. It is itself an outcome of
<em>papañca</em>, or conceptual prolificity, and betrays an enslavement to the syntax.</p>
<p>When one says ‘the river flows’, it does not mean that there is a river quite
apart from the act of flowing. Likewise the idiom ‘it rains’ should not be taken
to imply that there is something that rains. It is only a turn of speech,
fulfilling a certain requirement of the grammatical structure.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion we happened to discuss some very important aspects of the
<em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn454-1"><a href="#fn-fn454">17</a></sup> We saw how the Buddha presented a philosophy of
language, which seems so extraordinary even to modern thinkers. This
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> also brings out a similar attitude to the linguistic medium.</p>
<p>Such elements of a language as nouns and verbs reflect the worldling’s mode of
thinking. As in the case of a child’s imagination, a noun appears as a must. So
it has to rain for there to be rain. The implicit verbal sense becomes obscured,
or else it is ignored. A periphrastic usage receives acceptance. So the rain
rains, and the river flows. A natural phenomenon becomes mystified and
hypostasized.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism is a characteristic of the pre-historic man’s philosophy of
life. Wherever there was an activity, he imagined some form of life. This
animistic trend of thought is evident even in the relation between the noun and
the verb. The noun has adjectives as attributes and the verb has adverbs to go
with it. Particles fall in between, and there we have what is called grammar. If
one imagines that the grammar of language must necessarily conform to the
grammar of nature, one falls into a grievous error.</p>
<p>Now the commentators also seem to have fallen into such an error in their
elaborate exegesis on Nibbāna, due to a lack of understanding of this philosophy
of language. That is why the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> now finds itself relegated,
though it is at the head of the suttas of the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of concepts that nouns are invested with a certain amount of
permanence. Even a verbal noun, once it is formed, gets a degree of permanence
more or less superimposed on it. When one says ‘the river flows’, one somehow
tends to forget the flowing nature of the so-called river. This is the result of
the perception of permanence.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, perception as such carries with it the notion of
permanence, as we mentioned in an earlier sermon.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn455-1"><a href="#fn-fn455">18</a></sup> To perceive is to
grasp a sign. One can grasp a sign only where one imagines some degree of
permanence.</p>
<p>The purpose of perception is not only to recognize for oneself, but also to make
it known to others. The Buddha has pointed out that there is a very close
relationship between recognition and communication. This fact is expressly
stated by the Buddha in the following quotation from the Sixes of the <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vohāravepakkaṁ ahaṁ, bhikkhave, saññaṁ vadāmi. Yathā yathā naṁ sañjānāti,
tathā tathā voharati, evaṁ saññī ahosin’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn456-1"><a href="#fn-fn456">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I say that perception has linguistic usage as its result. In whatever
way one perceives, so one speaks out about it, saying: ‘I was of such a
perception’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>vepakka</em> is a derivative from the word <em>vipāka</em>, which in the context
of <em>kamma</em>, or ethically significant action, generally means the result of that
action. In this context, however, its primary sense is evident, that is, as some
sort of a ripening. In other words, what this quotation implies is that
perception ripens or matures into verbal usage or convention.</p>
<p>So here we see the connection between <em>saññā</em>, perception, and <em>saṅkhā</em>,
reckoning. This throws more light on our earlier explanation of the last line of
a verse in the <em>Kalahavivādasutta</em>, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā,</em></p>
<p>for reckonings born of prolificity have perception as their source.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn457-1"><a href="#fn-fn457">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we are in a better position to appreciate the statement that linguistic
usages, reckonings and designations are the outcome of perception. All this goes
to show that an insight into the philosophy of language is essential for a
proper understanding of this Dhamma. This is the moral behind the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>Beings are usually dominated by these reckonings, appellations and designations,
because the perception of permanence is inherent in them. It is extremely
difficult for one to escape it. Once the set of such terms as milk, curd and
butter comes into vogue, the relation between them becomes an insoluble problem
even for the great philosophers.</p>
<p>Since we have been talking about the concept of Nibbāna so much, one might ask:
“So then, Nibbāna is not an absolute, <em>paramattha</em>?” It is not a <em>paramattha</em> in
the sense of an absolute. It is a <em>paramattha</em> only in the sense that it is the
highest good, <em>parama attha</em>.</p>
<p>This is the sense in which the word was used in the discourses,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn458-1"><a href="#fn-fn458">21</a></sup> though
it has different connotations now. As exemplified by such quotations as
<em>āraddhaviriyo paramatthapattiyā</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn459-1"><a href="#fn-fn459">22</a></sup> “with steadfast energy for the
attainment of the highest good”, the suttas speak of Nibbāna as the highest good
to be attained.</p>
<p>In later Buddhist thought, however, the word <em>paramattha</em> came to acquire
absolutist connotations, due to which some important discourses of the Buddha on
the question of worldly appellations, worldly expressions and worldly
designations fell into disuse. This led to an attitude of dwelling in the
scaffolding, improvised just for the purpose of constructing a building.</p>
<p>As a postscript to our exposition of the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> we may add the
following important note: This particular discourse is distinguished from all
other discourses in respect of one significant feature. That is, the concluding
statement to the effect that the monks who listened to the sermon were not
pleased by it.</p>
<p>Generally we find at the end of a discourse a more or less thematic sentence
like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>attamanā te bhikkhū Bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinanduṁ,</em></p>
<p>those monks were pleased and they rejoiced in the words of the
Exalted One.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn460-1"><a href="#fn-fn460">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in this sutta we find the peculiar ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>idaṁ avoca Bhagavā, na te bhikkhū Bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinanduṁ,</em></p>
<p>the Exalted One said this, but those monks did not rejoice in the words of the
Exalted One.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn461-1"><a href="#fn-fn461">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commentators seem to have interpreted this attitude as an index to the
abstruseness of the discourse.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn462-1"><a href="#fn-fn462">25</a></sup> This is probably why this discourse came
to be neglected in the course of time.</p>
<p>But on the basis of the exposition we have attempted, we might advance a
different interpretation of the attitude of those monks. The declaration that
none of the concepts, including that of Nibbāna, should be egoistically
imagined, could have caused displeasure in monks, then as now. So much, then,
for the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em>.</p>
<p>The Buddha has pointed out that this <em>maññanā</em>, or egoistic imagining, or
me-thinking, is an extremely subtle bond of Māra.</p>
<p>A discourse which highlights this fact comes in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> under the
title <em>Yavakalāpisutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn463-1"><a href="#fn-fn463">26</a></sup> In this discourse the Buddha brings out this
fact with the help of a parable. It concerns the battle between gods and demons,
which is a theme that comes up quite often in the discourses.</p>
<p>In a war between gods and demons, the gods are victorious and the demons are
defeated. The gods bind Vepacitti, the king of the demons, in a fivefold
bondage, that is, hands and feet and neck, and bring him before Sakka, the king
of the gods.</p>
<p>This bondage has a strange mechanism about it. When Vepacitti thinks “gods are
righteous, demons are unrighteous, I will go to the <em>deva</em> world”, he
immediately finds himself free from that bondage and capable of enjoying the
heavenly pleasures of the five senses.</p>
<p>But as soon as he slips into the thought “gods are unrighteous, demons are
righteous, I will go back to the <em>asura</em> world”, he finds himself divested of
the heavenly pleasures and bound again by the fivefold bonds.</p>
<p>After introducing this parable, the Buddha comes out with a deep disquisition of
Dhamma for which it serves as a simile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ sukhumaṁ kho, bhikkhave, Vepacittibandhanaṁ. Tato sukhumataraṁ
Mārabandhanaṁ. Maññamāno kho, bhikkhave, baddho Mārassa, amaññamāno mutto
pāpimato.</em></p>
<p><em>Asmī’ti, bhikkhave, maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’ayaṁ ahaṁ asmī’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ,
’bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’na bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’rūpī
bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’arūpī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’saññī
bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ, ’asaññī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ,
’nevasaññīnāsaññī bhavissan’ti maññitaṁ etaṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Maññitaṁ, bhikkhave, rogo, maññitaṁ gaṇḍo, maññitaṁ sallaṁ. Tasmātiha,
bhikkhave, ’amaññamānena cetasā viharissāmā’ti evañhi vo, bhikkhave,
sikkhitabbaṁ.</em></p>
<p>So subtle, monks, is the bondage of Vepacitti. But more subtle still is the
bondage of Māra. Imagining, monks, one is bound by Māra, not imagining one is
freed from the Evil One.</p>
<p>‘Am’, monks, is an imagining, ‘this am I’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be’ is an
imagining, ‘I shall not be’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be one with form’ is an
imagining, ‘I shall be formless’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be percipient’ is
an imagining, ‘I shall be non-percipient’ is an imagining, ‘I shall be
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is an imagining.</p>
<p>Imagining, monks, is a disease, imagining is an abscess, imagining is a barb,
therefore, monks, should you tell yourselves: ‘We shall dwell with a mind free
from imaginings, thus should you train yourselves’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, let us try to get at the meaning of this exhortation. The opening
sentence is an allusion to the simile given above. It says that the bondage in
which Vepacitti finds himself is of a subtle nature, that is to say, it is a
bondage connected with his thoughts. Its very mechanism is dependent on his
thoughts.</p>
<p>But then the Buddha declares that the bondage of Māra is even subtler. And what
is this bondage of Māra? “Imagining, monks, one is bound by Māra, not imagining
one is freed from that Evil One.” Then comes a list of nine different ways of
imaginings.</p>
<p>In the same discourse the Buddha goes on to qualify each of these imaginings
with four significant terms, namely: <em>iñjitaṁ</em> agitation, <em>phanditaṁ</em>
palpitation, <em>papañcitaṁ</em> proliferation and <em>mānagataṁ</em> conceit.</p>
<p><em>Iñjitaṁ</em> is an indication that these forms of imaginings are the outcome of
craving, since <em>ejā</em> is a synonym for <em>taṇhā</em>, or craving.</p>
<p><em>Phanditaṁ</em> is an allusion to the fickleness of the mind, as for instance
conveyed by the first line of a verse in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, <em>phandanaṁ capalaṁ
cittaṁ</em>, “the mind, palpitating and fickle”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn464-1"><a href="#fn-fn464">27</a></sup> The fickle nature of the
mind brings out those imaginings.</p>
<p>They are also the products of proliferation, <em>papañcita</em>. We have already
discussed the meaning of the term <em>papañca</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn465-1"><a href="#fn-fn465">28</a></sup> We happened to point out
that it is a sort of straying away from the proper path.</p>
<p><em>Mānagataṁ</em> is suggestive of a measuring. <em>Asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is the most
elementary standard of measurement. It is the peg from which all measurements
take their direction. As we pointed out in an earlier sermon, the grammatical
structure of language is based on this peg ‘am’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn466-1"><a href="#fn-fn466">29</a></sup></p>
<p>In connection with the three persons, first person, second person and third
person, we happened to mention that as soon as one grants ‘I am’, a ‘here’ is
born. It is only after a ‘here’ is born, that a ‘there’ and a ‘yonder’ come to
be. The first person gives rise to the second and the third person, to complete
the basic framework for grammar.</p>
<p>So <em>asmi</em>, or ‘am’, is itself a product of proliferation. In fact, the deviation
from the proper path, implied by the proliferation in <em>papañca</em>, is a result of
these multifarious imaginings.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of these imaginings that as soon as an imagining or a
me-thinking occurs, a thing is born as a matter of course. And with the birth of
a thing as ‘something’, impermanence takes over. That is to say, it comes under
the sway of impermanence.</p>
<p>This is a very strange phenomenon. It is only after becoming a ‘something’ that
it can become ‘another thing’. <em>Aññathābhāva</em>, or otherwiseness, implies a
change from one state to another. A change of state already presupposes some
state or other, and that is what is called a ‘thing’.</p>
<p>Now where does a ‘thing’ arise? It arises in the mind. As soon as something gets
hold of the mind, that thing gets infected with the germ of impermanence.</p>
<p>The modes of imagining listed above reveal a double bind. There is no freedom
either way. Whether one imagines ‘I shall be with form’ or ‘I shall be
formless’, one is in a dichotomy. It is the same with the two ways of imagining
‘I shall be percipient’, ‘I shall be non-percipient’.</p>
<p>We had occasion to refer to this kind of dichotomy while explaining the
significance of quite a number of discourses. The root of all this duality is
the thought ‘am’.</p>
<p>The following two verses from the <em>Dvayatānupassanāsutta</em> throw light on some
subtle aspects of <em>maññanā</em>, or imagining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yena yena hi maññanti,</em> <br />
<em>tato taṁ hoti aññathā,</em> <br />
<em>taṁ hi tassa musā hoti,</em> <br />
<em>mosadhammaṁ hi ittaraṁ.</em></p>
<p><em>Amosadhammaṁ Nibbānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>tad ariyā saccato vidū,</em> <br />
<em>te ve saccābhisamayā,</em> <br />
<em>nicchātā parinibbutā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn467-1"><a href="#fn-fn467">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In whatever way they imagine, <br />
Thereby it turns otherwise, <br />
That itself is the falsity <br />
Of this puerile deceptive thing.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is unfalsifying in its nature, <br />
That they understood as the truth, <br />
And indeed by the higher understanding of that truth <br />
They have become hungerless and fully appeased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first verse makes it clear that imagining is at the root of <em>aññathābhāva</em>,
or otherwiseness, in so far as it creates a thing out of nothing. As soon as a
thing is conceived in the mind by imagining, the germ of otherwiseness or change
enters into it at its very conception.</p>
<p>So a thing is born only to become another thing, due to the otherwiseness in
nature. To grasp a thing tenaciously is to exist with it, and birth, decay and
death are the inexorable vicissitudes that go with it.</p>
<p>The second verse says that Nibbāna is known as the truth, because it is of an
unfalsifying nature. Those who have understood it are free from the hunger of
craving. The word <em>parinibbuta</em> in this context does not mean that those who
have realized the truth have passed away. It only conveys the idea of full
appeasement or a quenching of that hunger.</p>
<p>Why is Nibbāna regarded as unfalsifying? Because there is no ‘thing’ in it. It
is so long as there is a thing that all the distress and misery follow. Nibbāna
is called <em>animitta</em>, or the signless, precisely because there is no-thing in
it.</p>
<p>Because it is signless, it is unestablished, <em>appaṇihita</em>. Only where there is
an establishment can there be a dislodgement. Since it is not liable to
dislodgement or disintegration, it is unshakeable. It is called <em>akuppā
cetovimutti</em>, unshakeable deliverance of the mind,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn468-1"><a href="#fn-fn468">31</a></sup> because of its
unshaken and stable nature. Due to the absence of craving there is no
directional apsiration, or <em>paṇidhi</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly <em>suññata</em>, or voidness, is a term implying that there is no essence in
Nibbāna in the substantial sense in which the worldlings use that term. As
mentioned in the <em>Mahāsāropamasutta</em>, deliverance itself is the essence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn469-1"><a href="#fn-fn469">32</a></sup>
Apart from that, there is nothing essential or substantial in Nibbāna. In short,
there is no thing to become otherwise in Nibbāna.</p>
<p>On an earlier occasion, too, we had to mention the fact that there is quite a
lot of confusion in this concern.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn470-1"><a href="#fn-fn470">33</a></sup> <em>Saṅkhata</em>, the compounded, is
supposed to be a thing. And <em>asaṅkhata</em>, or the uncompounded, is also a thing.
The compounded is an impermanent thing, while the uncompounded is a permanent
thing. The compounded is fraught with suffering, and the uncompounded is
blissful. The compounded is not self, but the uncompounded is … At this point
the line of argument breaks off.</p>
<p>Some of those who attempt this kind of explanation find themselves in a quandary
due to their lack of understanding of the issues involved. The two verses quoted
above are therefore highly significant.</p>
<p>Because of <em>maññanā</em>, worldlings tend to grasp, hold on and adhere to
mind-objects. The Buddha has presented these concepts just for the purpose of
crossing over the flood,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>desitā nissāya nissāya oghassa nittharaṇā,</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn471-1"><a href="#fn-fn471">34</a></sup></p>
<p>the process of crossing over the flood with relative dependence has been
preached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the <em>dhammas</em> that have been preached are for a practical purpose, based on
an understanding of their relative value, and not for grasping tenaciously, as
illustrated by such discourses like the <em>Rathavinītasutta</em> and the
<em>Alagaddūpamasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn472-1"><a href="#fn-fn472">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Let alone other concepts, not even Nibbāna as a concept is to be grasped. To
grasp the concept of Nibbāna is to slip into an error. So from the couplet
quoted above we clearly understand how subtle this <em>maññanā</em> is and why it is
called an extremely subtle bondage of Māra.</p>
<p>It might be recalled that while discussing the significance of the
<em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em> we mentioned that the non-manifestative consciousness
described in that discourse does not partake of the earthiness of earth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn473-1"><a href="#fn-fn473">36</a></sup>
That is to say, it is not under the sway of the earth quality of earth.</p>
<p>In fact as many as thirteen out of the twenty-four concepts mentioned in the
<em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> come up again in the <em>Brahmanimantanikasutta</em>. The
implication therefore is that the non-manifestative consciousness is not subject
to the influence of any of those concepts. It does not take any of those
concepts as substantial or essential, and that is why it is beyond their power.</p>
<p>For the same reason it is called the non-manifestative consciousness.
Consciousness as a rule takes hold of some object or other. This consciousness,
however, is called non-manifestative in the sense that it is devoid of the
nature of grasping any such object. It finds no object worthy of grasping.</p>
<p>What we have discussed so far could perhaps be better appreciated in the light
of another important sutta in the <em>Majjhima Nikāya</em>, namely the
<em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em>. A key to the moral behind this discourse is to be
found in the following dictum occurring in it:
<em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ abhinivesāya,</em>
“nothing is worth entering into dogmatically”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn474-1"><a href="#fn-fn474">37</a></sup></p>
<p>The word <em>abhinivesa</em>, suggestive of dogmatic adherence, literally means
‘entering into’. Now based on this idea we can bring in a relevant metaphor.</p>
<p>We happened to mention earlier that as far as concepts are concerned, the
<em>arahants</em> have no dogmatic adherence. Let us take, for instance, the concept of
‘a house’. <em>Arahants</em> also enter a house, but they do not enter into the concept
of ‘a house’. This statement might appear rather odd, but what we mean is that
one can enter a house without entering into the concept of ‘a house’.</p>
<p>Now leaving this as something of a riddle, let us try to analyse a certain fairy
tale-like episode in the <em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em>, somewhat as an interlude.</p>
<p>The main theme of the <em>Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta</em> is as follows: Once Sakka, the
king of the gods, came to see the Buddha when he was staying at Pubbārāma and
asked the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How does a monk attain deliverance by the complete destruction of craving?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quintessence of the Buddha’s brief reply to that question is the above
mentioned dictum,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ abhinivesāya,</em></p>
<p>“nothing is worth entering into dogmatically.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka rejoiced in this sermon approvingly and left. Venerable Mahā Moggallāna,
who was seated near the Buddha at that time, had the inquisitive thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did Sakka rejoice in this sermon having understood it, or did he rejoice
without understanding it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being curious to find this out he vanished from Pubbārāma and appeared in the
Tāvatiṁsa heaven as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm and
bend back his outstretched arm.</p>
<p>At that time Sakka was enjoying heavenly music. On seeing Venerable Mahā
Moggallāna coming at a distance he stopped the music and welcomed the latter,
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Come good sir Moggallāna, welcome good sir Moggallāna! It is a long time,
good sir Moggallāna, since you found an opportunity to come here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered a high seat to Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and took a low seat at one
side. Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked Sakka what sort of a sermon the
Buddha had preached to him on his recent visit, saying that he himself is
curious on listening to it.</p>
<p>Sakka’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good sir Moggallāna, we are so busy, we have so much to do, not only with our
own business, but also with the business of other gods of Tāvatiṁsa. So it is
not easy for us to remember such Dhamma discussions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Sakka goes on to relate some other episode, which to him seems more
important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After winning the war against the <em>asuras</em>, I had the Vejayanti palace built.
Would you like to see it, good sir Moggallāna?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably as a part of etiquette, binding on a visitor, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna
agreed and Sakka conducted him around the Vejayanti palace in the company of his
friend, king Vessavaṇa. It was a wonderful palace with hundreds of towers.
Sakka’s maids, seeing Venerable Mahā Moggallāna coming in the distance, were
embarrassed out of modest respect and went into their rooms. Sakka was taking
Venerable Mahā Moggallāna around, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See, good sir, how lovely this palace is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Mahā Moggallāna also courteously responded, saying that it is a
fitting gift for his past merit. But then he thought of arousing a sense of
urgency in Sakka, seeing how negligent he has become now. And what did he do? He
shook the Vejayanti palace with the point of his toe, using his supernormal
power.</p>
<p>Since Sakka had ‘entered into’ the Vejayanti palace with his craving, conceit
and views, he also was thoroughly shaken, along with the palace. That is to say,
a sense of urgency was aroused in him, so much so that he remembered the sermon
the Buddha had preached to him.</p>
<p>It was then that Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked Sakka pointedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How did the Exalted One state to you in brief the deliverance through the
destruction of craving?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka came out with the full account, creditably.</p>
<p>So after all it seems that the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna took all this trouble
to drive home into Sakka the moral of the sermon <em>sabbe dhammā nālaṁ
abhinivesāya</em>, “nothing is worth clinging onto”.</p>
<p>If one goes through this discourse ignoring the deeper aspects of it, it appears
merely as a fairy tale. Even as those heavenly maidens entered their rooms,
Sakka also had entered into this Vejayanti palace of his own creation, while
showing his distinguished visitor around, like a rich man these days after
building his mansion.</p>
<p>So from this we can see the nature of these worldly concepts. For instance, in
the case of the concept of ‘a house’, entering the house physically does not
necessarily mean that one is ‘in it’. Only if one has entered into the concept
of a house is he ‘in it’.</p>
<p>Let us take a simply analogy. Little children sometimes build a little hut, out
of fun, with a few sticks and shady leaves. They might even invite their mother
for the house-warming. When the mother creeps into the improvised hut, she does
not seriously entertain the concept of ‘a house’ in it, as the children
would do.</p>
<p>It is the same in the case of Buddhas and <em>arahants.</em> To the Emancipated Ones,
who have fully understood and comprehended the true meaning of concepts like
‘house’, ‘mansion’ and ‘palace’, the sandcastles of adults appear no better than
the playthings of little children. We have to grant it, therefore, that
<em>tathāgatas</em>, or Such-like Ones, cannot help making use of concepts in worldly
usage.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, once a certain deity even raised the question whether the
emancipated <em>arahant</em> monks, when they use such expressions as ‘I speak’ and
‘they speak to me’, do so out of conceit. The Buddha’s reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo hoti bhikkhu arahaṁ katāvī,</em> <br />
<em>khīṇāsavo antimadehadhārī,</em> <br />
<em>’ahaṁ vadāmī’ti pi so vadeyya,</em> <br />
<em>’mamaṁ vadantī’ti pi so vadeyya</em> <br />
<em>loke samaññaṁ kusalo viditvā,</em> <br />
<em>vohāramattena so vohareyyā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn475-1"><a href="#fn-fn475">38</a></sup></p>
<p>That monk, who is an <em>arahant,</em> who has finished his task, <br />
Whose influxes are extinct and who bears his final body, <br />
Might still say ‘I speak’, <br />
He might also say ‘they speak to me’, <br />
Being skilful, knowing the world’s parlance, <br />
He uses such terms merely as a convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of an <em>arahant</em>, who has accomplished his task and is influx-free, a
concept like ‘house’, ‘mansion’, or ‘palace’ has no influence by way of craving,
conceit and views. He might say ‘I speak’ or ‘I preach’, he might even say ‘they
speak to me’, but since he has understood the nature of worldly parlance, he
uses such expressions as mere turns of speech. Therefore the Buddhas and
<em>arahants</em>, though they may enter a house, do not entertain the concept of ‘a
house’ in it.</p>
<p>Some might think that in order to destroy the concept of ‘a house’, one has to
break up the tiles and bricks into atoms. But that is not the way to
deliverance. One has to understand according to the law of dependent arising
that not only is a house dependent on tiles and bricks, but the tiles and bricks
are themselves dependent on a house. Very often philosophers forget about the
principle of relativity involved here.</p>
<p>Tiles and bricks are dependent on a house. This is a point worth considering.
One might think that a house is made up of tiles and bricks, but tiles and
bricks themselves come to be because of a house. There is a mutual relationship
between them.</p>
<p>If one raises the question: “What is a tile?”, the answer will be: “It is an
item used for building the roof of a house”. Likewise a brick is an item used in
building a wall. This shows the relativity between a house and a tile as well as
between a house and a brick. So there is no need to get down to an atomistic
analysis like nuclear physicists. Wisdom is something that enables one to see
this relativity penetratively, then and there.</p>
<p>Today we happened to discuss some deep sections of the Dhamma, particularly on
the subject of <em>maññanā</em>. A reappraisal of some of the deep suttas preached by
the Buddha, now relegated into the background as those dealing with conventional
truth, will be greatly helpful in dispelling the obsessions created by
<em>maññanā</em>. What the <em>Mūlapariyāyasutta</em> offers in this respect is of utmost
importance.</p>
<p>In fact, the Buddha never used a language totally different from the language of
the worldlings. Now, for instance, chemists make use of a certain system of
symbolic formulas in their laboratories, but back at home they revert to another
set of symbols. However, both are symbols. There is no need to discriminate
between them as higher or lower, so long as they serve the purpose at hand.</p>
<p>Therefore it is not proper to relegate some sermons as discursive or
conventional in style. Always it is a case of using concepts in worldly
parlance. In the laboratory one uses a particular set of symbols, but on
returning home he uses another. In the same way, it is not possible to earmark a
particular bundle of concepts as absolute and unchangeable.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>Poṭṭhapādasutta</em>, already discussed, all these concepts are
worldly appellations, worldly expressions, worldly usages, worldly designations,
which the Tathāgata makes use of without tenacious grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn476-1"><a href="#fn-fn476">39</a></sup> However
philosophical or technical the terminology may be, the <em>arahants</em> make use of it
without grasping it tenaciously.</p>
<p>What is of importance is the function it fulfils. We should make use of the
conceptual scaffolding only for the purpose of putting up the building. As the
building comes up, the scaffolding has to leave. It has to be dismantled. If one
simply clings onto the scaffolding, the building would never come up.</p>
