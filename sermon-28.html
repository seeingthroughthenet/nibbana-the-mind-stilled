</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the twenty-eighth sermon in the series
of sermons on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Right view, the first factor of the noble eightfold path, is defined as the
knowledge of all the four noble truths, namely that of suffering, its arising,
its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. This is a pointer to the
fact that some understanding of cessation, or Nibbāna, is essential for the
practice of the path.</p>
<p>According to a discourse among the Twos of the <em>Aṅguttara-nikāya</em>, there are two
conditions for the arising of this right view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dve ’me, bhikkhave, paccayā sammādiṭṭhiyā uppādāya. Katame dve? Parato ca
ghoso yoniso ca manasikāro.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn900-1"><a href="#fn-fn900">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, there are these two conditions for the arising of right view. Which
two? Hearing from another and radical reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, <em>yoniso manasikāra</em>, or ‘radical reflection’, is attention by
way of source or matrix. The deeper dimensions of its meaning would have come to
light in our discussion of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> with reference to a quotation
from the <em>Mahāpadānasutta</em>, in one of our earlier sermons. There we saw how the
bodhisatta Vipassī went on reflecting from the very end of the formula of
<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, of dependent arising, in reverse order and gradually
arrived at the true source.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn901-1"><a href="#fn-fn901">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kimhi nu kho sati jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, kiṁ paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ? Jātiyā kho sati
jarāmaraṇaṁ hoti, jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ.</em></p>
<p>What being there, does decay and death come to be? Conditioned by what, is
decay-and-death? Birth being there does decay-and-death come to be,
conditioned by birth is decay-and-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, he directed his radical reflection gradually upwards, beginning
from decay-and-death, and at last came to the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex between
consciousness and name-and-form, which we discussed at length. This is an
illustration of the deepest sense of <em>yoniso manasikāra</em> as an attitude
essential for seeing the law of dependent arising within one’s own experience.</p>
<p>By now we have already laid bare some first principles for the arising of this
radical reflection in the form of similes like the magic show and the chess
game. Those similes have illustrated for us the first principle that a thing
originates from, and its ‘thingness’ depends on, the psychological responses and
mental traits of the person concerned.</p>
<p>The magic show and the chess game have exposed the fact that the signs and
symbols which we conceive to be out there owe their significance and symbolic
nature to the deep-rooted psychological mainsprings of lust, hate and delusion.</p>
<p>It was while discussing how the <em>Sūcilomasutta</em> presents the question of radical
reflection that we were forced to stop our last sermon. To the question of
Yakkha Sūciloma as to the source of lust, hate, delight and terror, the Buddha
replied that they arise ‘hence’, from ‘hence’ itself. In the Pāli verses the
Yakkha’s questions <em>kutonidānā, kutojā, kuto samuṭṭhāya</em> met with the replies
<em>itonidānā, itojā, ito samuṭṭhāya</em> from the Buddha’s side.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn902-1"><a href="#fn-fn902">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This <em>ito</em>, ‘hence’, means from within one’s self. This is clear from the term
<em>attasambhūta</em>, ‘self-begotten’, in the reply given by the Buddha. It is to
illustrate this self-begotten nature that the Buddha brings in the similes of
the banyan tree and the <em>māluvā</em> creeper. When the runners coming down from the
branches of a banyan tree reach the ground and get rooted, after a time, it will
be difficult to distinguish the original trunk of the tree from its offsprings.
So also is the case with the parasitic <em>māluvā</em> creeper. When the seed of a
<em>māluvā</em> creeper takes root in the fork of a tree and grows up, it not only
kills the tree, but also overspreads it in such a way as to obscure its origin.</p>
<p>From these similes we can infer that the self-begotten nature of those
psychological states are also generally overlooked or ignored. They are revealed
only to radical reflection, to attention by way of source or matrix. That is why
the Buddha emphasizes the need for discerning the true source. That it is an
injunction directly relevant to the practice is clearly expressed in the last
verse in the <em>Sūcilomasutta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ye naṁ pajānanti yatonidānaṁ,</em> <br />
<em>te naṁ vinodenti, suṇohi yakkha,</em> <br />
<em>te duttaram ogham imaṁ taranti,</em> <br />
<em>atiṇṇapubbaṁ apunabbhavāya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn903-1"><a href="#fn-fn903">5</a></sup></p>
<p>And they that know wherefrom it springs, <br />
They dispel it, listen, O! Yakkha. <br />
They cross this flood so hard to cross, <br />
Never crossed before, to become no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary takes the term <em>yatonidānaṁ</em> in this verse as a reference to the
second noble truth of craving. The term <em>attasambhūta</em> is explained as ‘arisen
within oneself’, <em>attani sambhūtā</em>, but not much attention is given to
it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn904-1"><a href="#fn-fn904">6</a></sup> However, if we are to elicit the deeper meaning of these lines, we
have to take up for comment this term, occurring in the preceding verse.</p>
<p>We came across this term earlier, too, in our discussion of a verse in the
<em>Kosala Saṁyutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn905-1"><a href="#fn-fn905">7</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lobho, doso ca moho ca</em> <br />
<em>purisaṁ pāpacetasaṁ</em> <br />
<em>hiṁsanti attasambhūtā</em> <br />
<em>tacasāraṁ va samphalaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn906-1"><a href="#fn-fn906">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Greed and hate and delusion too, <br />
Sprung from within work harm on him <br />
Of evil wit, as does its fruit <br />
On the reed for which the bark is pith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, too, the term <em>attasambhūta</em> is mentioned. When we reflect
deeply on the significance of this term, we are first of all reminded of the
vortex simile we employed to explain the reciprocal relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form in our discussion of the law of dependent
arising as stated in the <em>Mahānidānasutta</em> at the very outset of this series of
sermons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn907-1"><a href="#fn-fn907">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Attasambhūta</em>, literally rendered, would mean ‘originating from oneself’. But
this so-called oneself conceived as a unit or centre of activity, is actually
based on a duality. The notion of a self is to be traced to an interrelation
between two conditions, that is, the reciprocal relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form, which we discussed earlier too.</p>
<p><em>Viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā viññāṇaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn908-1"><a href="#fn-fn908">10</a></sup> “dependent on
consciousness is name-and-form, dependent on name-and-form is consciousness”. As
the <em>bodhisatta</em> Vipassī understood through radical reflection, consciousness
turns back from name-and-form, it does not go beyond, <em>paccudāvattati kho idaṁ
viññāṇaṁ nāmarūpamhā, nāparaṁ gacchati</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a vortex, a turning round. The delusion or ignorance is the
non-understanding of the reciprocal relationship between these two. The
understanding of it is the insight into the true source of all defilements.</p>
<p>To hark back to our simile of the chess game, this non-understanding is like the
split into two sides. The two friends quite amicably prepared the chess board
and the pieces. But for them to play the game, there should be two sides. It is
after this bifurcation and confrontation as two sides that the actual game
starts, with its vicissitudes of winning and losing.</p>
<p>Preparations grow yielding the consequences of wish fulfilments and
disappointments to the competitors. This is the norm underlying this
bifurcation. So ignorance is the non-understanding of the fact that the basis of
this <em>attasambhava</em> or springing up from within, namely, the dichotomy, is in
fact a mutual interrelation between two conditions.</p>
<p>In other words, the ignorance which gives rise to those preparations that go to
create the vortex between consciousness and name-and-form is the
non-understanding of the mutual interrelation implicit in this vortical
interplay. That is why one is instructed in insight meditation to reflect on
preparations relating to name-and-form. An insight into those preparations
reveals this mutual interrelation. There is such a dichotomy implicit in the
term <em>attasambhava.</em></p>
<p>The commentary explains the correlative <em>yathonidānaṁ</em>, ‘whence arising’, as a
reference to <em>taṇhā</em> or craving. But it is actually an allusion to ignorance.
The true source is non-understanding. That is why the Buddha, in presenting the
formula of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>, went beyond craving and placed ignorance at the
head of the series of twelve links.</p>
<p>Very often, the commentators mention this as a possible point of controversy.
But the real reason for its precedence is the fact that ignorance is more
primary than craving as a condition. It is more basic than craving. When one
probes into the conditions for craving, one discovers ignorance as its root.</p>
<p>That is why, in stating the law of <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> in the reverse order, the
Buddha used the expression <em>avijjāya tv’eva asesavirāganirodhā</em>, etc., “with the
remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance” etc.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn909-1"><a href="#fn-fn909">11</a></sup> It is with
the cessation of ignorance that the entire series of conditions move in the
opposite direction. So ignorance is primary as a condition.</p>
<p>We can explain this primacy in another way. Now <em>upādāna</em> is that grasping of
the object of craving. Actually it signifies a holding onto something. What
gives the impression that the object of craving is something that can be grasped
is a lack of a deep understanding of the principle of duality.</p>
<p>Craving finds something to hold onto precisely because one presumes that there
actually exists a thing to be grasped. That is how it gets object status. This
way, we can explain the basic reason for the recurrent birth in <em>saṁsāra</em> as the
non-understanding of the mutual interrelation between conditions. This sustains
the notion of a duality.</p>
<p>There is a verse in the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em> which throws more light on the
meaning of the term <em>attasambhava</em>. The verse, which is found also in the
section on the Eights in the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, as well as in the <em>Udāna</em>, runs
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em> <br />
<em>bhavasaṅkhāram avassajī munī</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattarato samhāhito</em> <br />
<em>abhindi kavacam iv’attasambhavaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn910-1"><a href="#fn-fn910">12</a></sup></p>
<p>That preparation for becoming, <br />
The Sage gave up, <br />
Whence arise an ‘equal’ and an ‘unequal’, <br />
Inwardly rapt and concentrated, <br />
He split like an armour <br />
The origin of self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the spot called <em>cāpāla cetiya</em> the Buddha renounced the preparations
pertaining to the life span and declared that he will attain <em>parinibbāna</em> three
months hence. There was an earth tremor immediately afterwards and the Buddha
uttered this paean of joy to explain its significance.</p>
<p>However, this verse has puzzled many scholars, both eastern and western. The
commentators themselves are in a quandary. They advance alternative
interpretations, particularly in connection with the riddle-like terms <em>tulam
atulaṁ</em> as evidenced by the commentaries to the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em> and <em>Aṅguttara
Nikāya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn911-1"><a href="#fn-fn911">13</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the first interpretation given, <em>tulaṁ</em> stands for whatever
pertains to the sense-sphere, and <em>atulaṁ</em> refers to the fine-material and
immaterial spheres. The second interpretation, prefixed by an ‘or else’,
<em>athavā</em>, takes <em>tulaṁ</em> to mean both the sense-sphere and the fine-material
sphere and <em>atulaṁ</em> to refer only to the immaterial sphere. In a third
interpretation, <em>tulaṁ</em> is taken to mean ‘of little karmic result’, and <em>atulaṁ</em>
to mean ‘of great result’.</p>
<p>A fourth interpretation tries to tackle the difficult term in a different way
altogether: <em>’tulan’ti tulento tīrento, ’atulañ ca sambhavan’ti nibbānañ ceva
sambhavañ ca.</em> “<em>Tulaṁ</em> means comparing, determining, <em>atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em>
means Nibbāna and becoming.” Here the word <em>tulaṁ</em> is presumed to be a present
participle.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, <em>Nettippakaraṇa</em> advances yet another
interpretation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn912-1"><a href="#fn-fn912">14</a></sup> <em>’Tulan’ti saṅkhāradhātu, ’atulan’ti nibbānadhātu</em>,
“<em>tulaṁ</em> means <em>saṅkhāra</em>-element, <em>atulaṁ</em> means Nibbāna-element.”</p>
<p>It seems, however, that we have to approach the whole problem from a different
angle altogether. The twin term <em>tulam atulaṁ</em> most probably represents the
principle of duality we have discussed at length in this series of sermons.
<em>Tulaṁ</em> and <em>atulaṁ</em> in a pair-wise combination convey the idea of equality and
inequality as antonyms.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ</em> is suggestive of that dichotomy which
forms the basis of the self idea. <em>Attasambhava</em> or the origin of the
self-notion is traceable to this dichotomy, which is like the two friends
confronting each other in a game of chess. The two sides of the game may be
taken as two halves of the same thing, standing opposite to each other. This is
the ‘tragi-comedy’ of the situation. It is on these two halves or this dichotomy
that the origin of the notion of self is based.</p>
<p>A clear enunciation of this truth is found in the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>. For instance,
the following verse of the <em>Māgandiyasutta</em> brings out the principle of
dichotomy rather rhetorically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Saccan’ti so brāhmaṇo kiṁ vadeyya</em> <br />
<em>’musā’ti vā so vivadetha kena</em> <br />
<em>yasmiṁ samaṁ visamañ cāpi natthi</em> <br />
<em>sa kena vādaṁ paṭisamyujeyya.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn913-1"><a href="#fn-fn913">15</a></sup></p>
<p>What could that Brahmin speak of as ‘truth’, <br />
How could he debate calling something ‘false’, <br />
By what criterion could he, in whom there is no distinction <br />
Between equal and unequal, join issue in a debate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come across a similar verse in the <em>Attadaṇḍasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Na samesu na omesu,</em> <br />
<em>na ussesu vadate muni</em> <br />
<em>santo so vītamaccharo</em> <br />
<em>nādeti na nirassati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn914-1"><a href="#fn-fn914">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The sage does not grade himself, <br />
Among equals, inferiors or superiors, <br />
Being at peace and with selfishness gone, <br />
He neither takes up nor throws away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again the issue is the triple conceit. It is by dispelling conceit that the
sage entertains no inclinations to grade himself among equals, inferiors or
superiors. Peaceful and unselfish as he is, he neither acquires nor rejects.
Here we see a reference to that dichotomy.</p>
<p>The same idea comes up in another guise in the following verse of the
<em>Tuvaṭakasutta</em> of the <em>Sutta Nipāta</em>, which can be an incentive to the
recollection of peace, <em>upasamānussati</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ajjhattaṁ eva upasame,</em> <br />
<em>nāññato bhikkhu santiṁ eseyya</em> <br />
<em>ajjhattaṁ upasantassa</em> <br />
<em>natthi attaṁ, kuto nirattaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn915-1"><a href="#fn-fn915">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Let the monk inwardly calm himself, <br />
Let him not seek peace from outside, <br />
To one who is inwardly calm, <br />
There is nothing taken up or rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We came across the two terms <em>attaṁ nirattaṁ</em> earlier too, in our discussion of
a verse in the <em>Duṭṭhaṭṭhakasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn916-1"><a href="#fn-fn916">18</a></sup> There, the line <em>attaṁ nirattaṁ na
hi tassa atthi</em> meant the absence of the idea of taking up and rejecting in an
<em>arahant</em>.</p>
<p>Very often scholars interpret the term <em>attaṁ</em> in this context as ‘self’, which
in our opinion is incorrect. The phrase <em>nādeti na nirassati</em> gives a clear hint
as to the etymology of this term. It is derived from <em>dā</em> prefixed by <em>ā</em>,
giving <em>ādatta</em>, which by syncopation becomes <em>ātta</em>, which again by shortening
of the vowel comes as <em>atta</em>. <em>Niratta</em> is derived from <em>nirassati</em>.</p>
<p>These two terms, suggestive of a duality, remind us of the water pump we
mentioned in our discussion of the vortex.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn917-1"><a href="#fn-fn917">19</a></sup> There is nothing really
automatic even in a water pump, which takes in and throws out. Due to these two
aspects in the mechanism of a water pump, we call it a unit. From the point of
view of a water pump, it is capable of performing both functions. It is from
this point of view that we attribute a unitary significance to it. In this very
concept of a unit, one can discern the delusion involved.</p>
<p>Delusion is the apex of the vicious triangle greed, hate and delusion. Greed and
hate are the two feelers directed from the apex delusion. Though we regard them
as two functions, the taking in and throwing out are simply two aspects of the
same function. All this points to the depth of the idea of duality and to the
vortex simile, which our commentarial tradition seems to have ignored.</p>
<p>It is the same theme of duality that comes up in the first two lines of that
cryptic verse of the <em>Brāhmaṇa Vagga</em> in the <em>Dhammapada</em>, we had occasion to
quote earlier. <em>Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā, pārāpāraṁ na vijjati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn918-1"><a href="#fn-fn918">20</a></sup> To that
Brahmin, that is the <em>arahant</em>, there is neither a farther shore nor a hither
shore nor both. There is something extraordinary about this statement.</p>
<p>Against this background, we can now advance a plausible interpretation to the
puzzling verse we had quoted earlier in this discussion. The first two lines
could be understood as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>tulam atulañ ca sambhavaṁ, bhavasaṅkhāram avassajī munī</em></p>
<p>The Sage renounced the preparations for becoming, which give rise to a
distinction between equal and unequal,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is to say, the Supreme Sage gave up those preparations productive of the
dichotomy between the concepts of equal and unequal.</p>
<p>Now the next two lines could be explained as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ajjhattarato samhāhito abhindi kavacam iv’attasambhavaṁ</em></p>
<p>Inwardly content and concentrated he broke up the point of origin of self like
an armour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This breaking up of the armour happened not at the moment he uttered this verse,
but at the moment he attained perfect enlightenment. Then what is the
provocation for making such a declaration at this juncture?</p>
<p>The Buddha renounced the preparations pertaining to the life span,
<em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, after several requests to that effect by Māra. It may seem that
the Buddha bowed down to Māra’s request and that he came under Māra’s sway when
he declared that the Tathāgata’s Parinibbāna will take place three months hence.
But the true implication of the verse in question is that the armour of Māra,
the armour of self-origin, <em>attasambhava</em>, has been broken down already and as
such he is not within the clutches of Māra.</p>
<p>Some scholars seem to identify this giving up of preparations for becoming,
<em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em>, with the renouncing of preparations pertaining to the lifespan,
<em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>. But there is a distinction between these two.</p>
<p>The former, that is <em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em>, are preparations productive of existence,
which go to build up a <em>bhava</em>. These the Buddha had already done away with by
breaching the <em>saṁsāric</em> vortex between <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>nāmarūpa</em>. <em>Chinnaṁ
vaṭṭaṁ na vattati,</em> “the whirlpool cut off whirls no more”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn919-1"><a href="#fn-fn919">21</a></sup> Those eddies
are no longer active in that consciousness.</p>
<p>Preparations pertaining to the life span, <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, have to be explained
differently. The term <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em>, mentioned in the <em>Mahāparinibbānasutta</em>,
refers to the ability the Buddha possessed by virtue of developing the four
bases of success, <em>iddhipāda</em>, of lengthening his life span.</p>
<p>Because Venerable Ānanda did not invite him at the correct moment to make use of
that ability, he renounced it at <em>cāpāla cetiya</em>. That renouncing is compared in
that sutta itself to a vomiting. The Buddha tells Ānanda that it is not in the
nature of a Tathāgata to take in what he has already vomited, even for the sake
of life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn920-1"><a href="#fn-fn920">22</a></sup></p>
<p>So then, <em>āyusaṅkhārā</em> and <em>bhavasaṅkhārā</em> have to be distinguished between.
Preparations pertaining to the life span are not the same as preparations
productive of existence or becoming.</p>
<p>Understood in this way, it becomes clear that all the attachments, aversions and
delusions in the world stem from a non-understanding of the fact that the
duality we have discussed so far is actually an interrelation. It is as if the
two friends, who amicably prepared the chess board, forgot their friendship when
they confronted each other as two sides.</p>
<p>This duality is a very subtle problem. The Buddha has pointed out how to resolve
it through understanding by means of various meditation techniques. Perhaps the
best illustration is the meditative attention by way of elements as stated in
the suttas. We have already mentioned about this to some extent in a previous
sermon while discussing the <em>Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn921-1"><a href="#fn-fn921">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If we are to analyse this technique of meditative attention by way of elements
from a practical point of view, we may cite the relevant section from the
<em>Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</em> preached by Venerable Sāriputta. Addressing his fellow
monks, Venerable Sāriputta says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Katamā c’āvuso paṭhavīdhātu? Paṭhavīdhātu siyā ajjhattikā siyā bāhirā. Katamā
c’āvuso ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu? Yaṁ ajjhattaṁ paccattaṁ kakkhaḷaṁ kharigataṁ
upādiṇṇaṁ, seyyathīdaṁ kesā lomā nakhā dantā taco maṁsaṁ nahāru aṭṭhī

kharigataṁ upādiṇṇaṁ, ayaṁ vuccat’āvuso ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu.</em></p>
<p><em>Yā c’eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu
paṭhavīdhāturev’esā. Taṁ netaṁ mama neso ’ham asmi, na meso attā’ti evam
etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ. Evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
disvā paṭhavīdhatuyā nibbindati, paṭhavīdhatuyā cittaṁ virājeti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn922-1"><a href="#fn-fn922">24</a></sup></p>
<p>What, Friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be either internal
or external. What, Friends, is the internal earth element? Whatever is
internal, belonging to oneself, hard, solid and clung to, that is, head hairs,
body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney,
heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines,
contents of the stomach, faeces, or whatever else is internal, belonging to
oneself, hard, solid and clung to, this is called, Friends, the internal earth
element.</p>
<p>Now whatever is the internal earth element and whatever is the external earth
element, both are simply the earth element; and that should be seen as it
actually is with right wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self.’ Having seen it as it actually is with right wisdom, one becomes
disenchanted with the earth element, becomes dispassionate towards the earth
element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta has not given here instances of the external earth element,
because it is obvious enough, that is: whatever is external to the body.</p>
<p>A statement that is of paramount importance here is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yā c’eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu
paṭhavīdhāturev’esā</em>,</p>
<p>now whatever is the internal element and whatever is the external earth
element, both are simply the earth element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When regarded as earth element, both are the same. This is the premise from
which insight takes off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That should be seen as it actually is with right wisdom thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this insight into the earth element with right wisdom one gets disenchanted
with it and becomes dispassionate.</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier too, the term <em>virāga</em>, usually rendered by
‘detachment’ or ‘dispassion’, has a nuance suggestive of a ‘fading
away’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn923-1"><a href="#fn-fn923">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Here the verb <em>virājeti</em> clearly brings out that nuance. Thus <em>paṭhavīdhatuyā
cittaṁ virājeti</em> seems to imply something like “he makes the earth element fade
away from his mind”.</p>
<p>We have already quoted such instances as <em>pītiyā ca virāgā</em>, “with the fading
away of joy”, and <em>avijjāvirāgā</em>, “with the fading away of ignorance”, to
highlight this nuance of the term <em>virāga</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, too, it seems the function of disenchantment, <em>nibbidā</em>, is to
see that whatever colour the earth element had infused in the mind is made to
fade away. It is a detachment as well as a decolouration.</p>
<p>What, then, is the true purpose of resolving the distinction between internal
and external with regard to the earth element? The purpose is the breaking up of
the foundation for cravings, conceits and views.</p>
<p>For ‘me’ to acquire some object out of craving that object has to exist apart
from ‘me’ and ‘I’ have to stand apart from it. The statement ‘this is mine’
presupposes a duality between ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Similarly, the statement ‘this am
I’, expressive of conceit, smacks of duality.</p>
<p>For instance, one gazing at a mirror is imperceptibly involved in this duality
when he tries to compare his face with its reflection on the mirror. This is the
irony of the situation in ordinary life. But what we have here, in this sutta,
is the opposite viewpoint. Not: ‘this is mine’, not: ‘this am I’, not: ‘this is
my self’.</p>
<p>What fosters this opposite point of view is the very absence of the distinction
between the internal and the external. The fundamental basis for acquisition or
measuring is gone. It is as if the unending game of chess with all its
vicissitudes has ended in a peaceful draw.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, our entire <em>saṁsāric</em> existence is a chess game between the
organic, <em>upādiṇṇa</em>, and the inorganic, <em>anupādiṇṇa</em>. For instance, the four
elements within this body, the grasped par excellence, or the clung to, and the
four elements as nutrition and atmosphere are always in conflict in their game
of chess. This chess game has as its vicissitudes the disturbances of the three
humours wind, bile and phlegm, on the physical side, and greed, hate and
delusion on the mental side.</p>
<p>These disturbances are to a great extent the outcome of this false dichotomy.
The task before a meditator, therefore, is the resolving of this conflict by a
penetrative understanding of the mutual interrelation between the two sides,
internal and external. When the gap between the two is removed, the mind becomes
equanimous.</p>
<p>We are told that the contemplation of the four elements is an effective means of
developing equanimity. Among the parts of our body, there are some we pride on
and cherish, some others, like excreta and urine, we abhor and detest. When
regarded as mere elements, attachment and revulsion give place to equanimity.
The description of the contemplation on elements, as found in the
<em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em>, clearly illustrates this fact. The relevant section runs as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Puna ca paraṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ
dhātuso paccavekkhati: Atthi imasmiṁ kāye paṭhavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu
vāyodhātū’ti.</em></p>
<p><em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, dakkho goghātako vā goghātakantevāsī vā gāviṁ vadhitvā
cātummahāpathe bilaso paṭivibhajitvā nisinno assa; evaṁ eva kho, bhikkhave,
bhikkhu imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ dhātuso paccavekkhati: Atthi
imasmiṁ kāye paṭhavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū’ti.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn924-1"><a href="#fn-fn924">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, monks, a monk reflects on this same body as it stands and as it is
disposed as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are the earth
element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element’.</p>
<p>Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow were seated
at the crossroads with it cut up into small pieces, so, too, a monk reflects
on this same body as it stands and as it is disposed as consisting of elements
thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the monk is instructed to reflect on this same body as it
stands and as it is disposed, <em>imam eva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ</em>. These
words are particularly significant, in that they do not imply an atomistic or
microscopic analysis. The four elements are already there in the body, and
though it is mentioned in brief here, in other discourses the organic instances
for each of them are described at length.</p>
<p>The simile used in connection with this analysis is highly significant. When a
butcher or his apprentice kills a cow, cuts it into small pieces and sits at the
crossroads ready to sell the meat, he is no longer particular about the cow from
which it came. He is conscious of it merely as a heap of meat. Similarly, the
contemplation by way of elements inculcates an equanimous attitude.</p>
<p>Just as the distinction between the <em>upādiṇṇa</em> and the <em>anupādiṇṇa</em> is
suggestive of the duality between the organic and the inorganic, the distinction
between <em>ajjhatta</em> and <em>bahiddhā</em> has relevance to the duality between one’s own
and another’s. This aspect of the reflection on elements emerges in the summary
like section that follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti ajjhattaṁ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati, bahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī
viharati, ajjhattabahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati</em>,</p>
<p>in this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he
abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating
the body as a body both internally and externally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, too, the aim is to break down the dichotomy between one’s own and
another’s. This contemplation is of a purpose to the extent that by it one
realizes the fact that, whether internal or external, it is just the four
elements. This norm is succinctly expressed as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yathā idaṁ tathā etaṁ, yathā etaṁ tathā idaṁ</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn925-1"><a href="#fn-fn925">27</a></sup></p>
<p>just as this, so is that; just as that, so is this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our minds are obsessed by the perception of diversity, <em>nānattasaññā</em>. According
to colour and form, we distinguish objects in the outside world and give them
names. It is a burden or a strain to the mind. The reflection by way of elements
as given in the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasutta</em> could even be appreciated as a step towards
the perception of unity, <em>ekattasaññā</em>, from this grosser perception of
diversity. It tends to relaxation and unification of the mind.</p>
<p>So the purpose of this reflection by way of the elements, peculiar to the
discourses, is to look upon the elements as void, in accordance with the
Buddha’s advice, <em>dhātuyo suññato passa</em>, “look upon the elements as
void”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn926-1"><a href="#fn-fn926">28</a></sup></p>
<p>However, for some reason or other, perhaps due to the influence of some Indian
schools of philosophy with a slant towards materialism, some Buddhist sects
indulged in academic subtleties which seem to obsess the mind with the four
elements with concepts about them, instead of the simpler reflection on elements
characteristic of the suttas. Originally the purpose was to erase the four
elements from the mind.</p>
<p>The original purpose was to make the four elements, the amorphous primaries
which masquerade as form in the minds of beings for incalculable aeons, to fade
away from the mind. But what happened later was to revel in atomistic analyses,
which more or less followed the way of thinking peculiar to materialism. It
ended up in hair-splitting analyses even literally, painting for instance the
earth element all the more vividly in the mind. We have to assess this academic
trend against the original purpose, unbiased by the traditional predilection for
it. It is no exaggeration to say that all this tended to obscure the path to
Nibbāna in the course of time.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s ‘research’ was something entirely different. His ‘research’ into
the four elements took a completely different course. In the <em>Nidānasaṁyutta</em> of
the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> the Buddha proclaims the results of his research into the
four elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, assādapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yo paṭhavīdhatuyā
assādo tad ajjhagamaṁ, yāvatā paṭhavīdhātuyā assādo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho.</em></p>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, ādīnavapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yo paṭhavīdhatuyā
ādīnavo tad ajjhagamaṁ, yavatā paṭhavīdhātuyā ādīnavo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho.</em></p>
<p><em>Paṭhavīdhātuyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, nissaraṇapariyesanaṁ acariṁ. Yaṁ paṭhavīdhatuyā
nissaraṇaṁ tad ajjhagamaṁ, yavatā paṭhavīdhātuyā nissaraṇaṁ paññāya me taṁ
sudiṭṭhaṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn927-1"><a href="#fn-fn927">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the gratification in the earth element. Whatever
gratification there is in the earth element, that have I found out; whatever
is the range of the gratification of the earth element, that have I well
discerned with wisdom.</p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the danger in the earth element. Whatever danger
there is in the earth element, that have I found out; whatever is the range of
the danger of the earth element, that have I well discerned with wisdom.</p>
<p>Monks, I went in search of the stepping out from the earth element. Whatever
stepping out there is from the earth element, that have I found out; whatever
is the range of the stepping out from the earth element, that have I well
discerned with wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is the Buddha’s research into the earth element. The discourse goes on
to state the same fact with regard to the other three elements.</p>
<p>The term <em>assāda</em>, mentioned in this sutta, is defined as the bodily pleasure
and mental happiness, <em>sukhaṁ somanassaṁ</em>, arising due to the earth element. The
danger in the earth element is its impermanent, suffering and changing nature,
<em>aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā</em>. The stepping out from it is the disciplining
and abandonment of desire for it, <em>chandarāgavinayo chandarāgappahānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>It is on the strength of this research that the Buddha even enjoined the
reflection on the four requisites. The <em>Ariyavaṁsasutta</em> makes this sufficiently
clear. In connection with the modes of reflection on the use of the four
requisites, a thematic phrase occurs which is highly significant in this
concern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Laddhā ca piṇḍapātaṁ agathito amucchito anajjhāpanno ādīnavadassāvī
nissaraṇapañño paribhuñjati.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn928-1"><a href="#fn-fn928">30</a></sup></p>
<p>On getting alms food he partakes of it without greed, uninfatuated,
unenslaved, being aware of the danger in it, with the wisdom in stepping out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terms <em>agathito amucchito anajjhāpanno</em>, “without greed, uninfatuated,
unenslaved”, are suggestive of the gratification which one has to withstand.</p>
<p>The term <em>ādīnavadassāvī</em>, “being aware of the danger”, is suggestive of
overeating and other possible risks in taking food.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression <em>nissaraṇapañño</em>, “with the wisdom in stepping
out”, in the highest sense is taking food with the deeper idea of abandoning
food in accordance with the cryptic dictum <em>āhāraṁ nissāya āhāraṁ pajahati</em>,
“gives up food depending on food”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn929-1"><a href="#fn-fn929">31</a></sup></p>
<p>It should be clear from the foregoing what the original idea behind the
contemplation on the elements was and what happened later. The later trends seem
to have ignored the fact that perception is a mirage. Research into these four
elements is a matter for the physicist, though it is like chasing a mirage with
thoughts and concepts. What is needed is the liberation of the mind from the
perception of form that is ingrained in the minds of beings due to the four
elements in this long <em>saṁsāra</em>.</p>
<p>All the meditation techniques the Buddha has taught are directed towards the
fading away of this perception of form. Because of these four primaries we have
a perception of form, which enables us to take signs. All the four are actually
impermanent, but the perceptual data we have gathered dependent on them are
indelibly imprinted on our minds.</p>
<p>Signs taken up in the far distant past in one’s <em>saṁsāra</em> can come up again and
again as attachments and aversions to perpetuate one’s <em>saṁsāric</em> existence. The
thoughts and prolific concepts arise out of this perception of form.</p>
<p>In other words, we distinguish between one thing and another according to colour
and shape. By evaluating them through attachments and aversions, we allow them
to get deeply rooted in our mind. These are the latencies to perception, which
in the <em>Madhupiṇḍikasutta</em> find mention in the expression <em>saññā nānusenti</em>,
“perceptions do not lie latent”.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn930-1"><a href="#fn-fn930">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Whereas the <em>arahant</em> does away with these latencies, the <em>non-arahant</em>
entertains them to some extent or other. These latencies account for the
prolific concepts with which beings heap up <em>saṁsāric</em> suffering. In order to
loosen the hold of these signs on our minds, the perilous aspect of the four
elements has to be emphasized.</p>
<p>That is why the Buddha in a number of discourses described to the monks the
impermanence of the four elements. It was not his intention to encourage any
atomistic analysis. He preached about the impermanence of the four elements to
expose the hollowness and vanity of this drama of existence – to erase the
perception of form, productive of this drama, from the minds of beings.</p>
<p>Now <em>saṅkhāra</em> is a term we often come across in the Dhamma. We happened to
suggest a possible nuance of the term, when we brought up similes relating to
the cinema and the theatre. <em>Saṅkhāra</em> is a term capable of comprehending the
entire range of preparations that go to make up a theatrical performance.</p>
<p>Now the Buddha has related the story of this great earth in some discourses. But
it is not an account of a scientific experiment, as our modern day scientists
would offer. The Buddha describes how this great earth came up and how it gets
destroyed in order to drive home into our minds the impermanence of the very
stage on which we enact our <em>saṁsāric</em> drama, thereby inculcating an attitude of
disenchantment and dispassion, <em>nibbidā</em> and <em>virāga</em>.</p>
<p>These <em>saṅkhāras</em>, pertaining to our drama of existence on this gigantic stage,
the earth, get deeply imprinted in our minds. They sink deep as latencies to
perception, productive of existence. It is to eradicate them that the Buddha has
placed before us the story of this great earth in some discourses. By far the
best illustration comes in the <em>Aggaññasutta</em> of the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>.</p>
<p>According to it, at the beginning of this aeon the earth was immersed in a
darkness and covered with water. The inhabitants were those who had come down
from the Ābhassara Brahma World. They were sex-less, mind-made, feeding on joy,
self-luminous and capable of moving through the air, <em>manomayā, pītibhakkhā
sayampabhā antalikkhacarā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn931-1"><a href="#fn-fn931">33</a></sup></p>
<p>After billions and billions of years, a savoury earth spread itself over the
waters, like the tissue that forms over hot milk as it cools. It was very sweet
and tempting. Some being of a greedy nature, exclaiming: “Ah! What can this
be?”, tasted this savoury earth with his finger. Craving arose in him as a
result of it. Others who saw him doing it did the same.</p>
<p>Then they all began digging into the savoury earth with their hands and eating
it, with the result that their subtle bodies became gross, hard and solid.
Craving also increased, and their minds became rougher and coarser. The
environment changed in unison, becoming grosser and grosser. So we have here the
perilous aspect. As the perils became manifest, the watery earth grew in
solidity and the simple life grew in complexity.</p>
<p>Billions and billions of years passed until the earth assumed its present shape
and appearance with all its gigantic mountains, rocks and buildings. But then,
in the <em>Sattasuriyasutta</em> of the <em>Aṅguttara Nikāya</em>, the Buddha describes what
happens to this great earth at the end of the aeon.</p>
<p>As the holocaust draws near, a second orb of the sun appears, and then a third,
a fourth, a fifth, a sixth and a seventh. The great earth in its entirety,
together with its mountains and rocks, goes ablaze, becoming just one huge flame
of fire, consuming all before it without leaving any ash or soot, like in a spot
where oil or ghee had burnt. So here we have no room for any atomism. In
conclusion the Buddha brings out the true aim and purpose of this discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaṁ aniccā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā, evaṁ addhuvā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā, evaṁ
anassāsikā, bhikkhave, saṅkhārā. Yāvañcidaṁ, bhikkhave, alam eva
sabbasaṅkhāresu nibbindituṁ alaṁ virajjituṁ alaṁ vimuccituṁ.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn932-1"><a href="#fn-fn932">34</a></sup></p>
<p>So impermanent, monks, are preparations, so unstable, monks, are preparations,
so unsatisfying, monks, are preparations. So much so, monks, this is enough to
get disenchanted with preparations, this is enough to get dispassionate with
them, this is enough to get released from them.</p>
