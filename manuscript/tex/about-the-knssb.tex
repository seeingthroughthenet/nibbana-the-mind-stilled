\chapter{About the K.N.S.S.B.}

Accordingly, K.N.S.S.B. has taken upon itself the duties of publication and distribution of books written by the venerable author as well as the recording and distribution of his sermons on CDs, in addition to maintaining the website \href{https://seeingthroughthenet.net/}{www.seeingthroughthenet.net} and the social networking site \href{https://www.facebook.com/seeingthrough}{www.facebook.com/seeingthrough}.
