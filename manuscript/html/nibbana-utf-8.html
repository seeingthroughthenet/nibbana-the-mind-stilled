<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Recently we have had an occasion
to listen to a series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
and there have been differences of opinion regarding the interpretation of some
deep <i>suttas</i> on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> in those
sermons. And so the venerable Great Preceptor suggested to me that it would be
useful to this group if I would give a set of sermons on <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, touching on those controversial points. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At first, for many reasons, I
hesitated to accept this invitation for a serious task, but then, as the
venerable Great Preceptor repeatedly encouraged me on this, I gave some thought
as to how best I could set about doing it. And it occurred to me that it would
be best if I could address these sermons directly to the task before us in this
Nissarana Vanaya, and that is meditative attention, rather than dealing with
those deep controversial <i>suttas</i> in academic isolation. And that is why I
have selected the above quotation as the theme for the entire set of sermons,
hoping that it would help create the correct atmosphere of meditative
attention. </span></p>

if we can successfully make use of this as both the heading and the theme of
these sermons, we would be in a position to understand those six qualities of
the <i>Dhamma</i>. We are told that the <i>Dhamma </i>is <i>sv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>kkh<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now at the very outset I would
like to say a few things by way of preparing the background and I do hope that
this assembly would bear with me for saying certain things that I will be
compelled to say in this concern. By way of background something has to be said
as to why there are so many complications with regard to the meaning of some of
the deep <i>suttas </i>on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a popular belief that the
commentaries are finally traceable to a miscellany of the Buddha word scattered
here and there, as <i>paki<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>akadesan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. But the true state of affairs seems to be rather
different. Very often the commentaries are unable to say something conclusive
regarding the meaning of deep <i>suttas</i>. So they simply give some possible
interpretations and the reader finds himself at a loss to choose the correct
one. Sometimes the commentaries go at a tangent and miss the correct
interpretation. Why the commentaries are silent on some deep <i>suttas</i> is also
a problem to modern day scholars. There are some historical reasons leading to
this state of affairs in the commentaries. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;&#7751;</span>isutta</i>

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> we find
the Buddha making certain prophetic utterances regarding the dangers that will
befall the <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sana </i>in the future. It is said
that in times to come, monks will lose interest in those deep <i>suttas</i>
which deal with matters transcendental, that they would not listen to those <i>suttas</i>
that have to do with the idea of emptiness, <i>suÃ±Ã±at<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is also another historical
reason that can be adduced. An idea got deeply rooted at a certain stage in the
<i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sana</i> history that what is contained in
the <i>Sutta Pi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>aka </i>is simply the
conventional teaching and so it came to imply that there is nothing so deep in
these <i>suttas</i>. This notion also had its share in the present lack of
interest in these <i>suttas</i>. According to <i>Manorathap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ra<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#299;</span></i>, the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara
</i>commentary, already at an early stage in the <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sana
</i>history of Sri Lanka, there had been a debate between those who upheld the
precept and those who stood for realization.<a name="_ednref4"></a><a
href="#_edn4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:
8.0pt'>[4]</span></span></a> And it is said that those who upheld the precept
won the day. The final conclusion was that, for the continuity of the <i>S<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sana</i>, precept itself is enough, not so much the
realization. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Of course the efforts of the
reciter monks of old for the preservation of the precept in the midst of
droughts and famines and other calamitous situations are certainly
praiseworthy. But the unfortunate thing about it was this: the basket of the
Buddha word came to be passed on from hand to hand in the dark, so much so that
there was the risk of some valuable things slipping out in the process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Also there have been certain
semantic developments in the commentarial period, and this will be obvious to
anyone searching for the genuine <i>Dhamma</i>. It seems that there had been a
tendency in the commentarial period to elaborate even on some lucid words in
the <i>suttas</i>, simply as a commentarial requirement, and this led to the
inclusion of many complicated ideas. By too much overdrawing in the
commentaries, the deeper meanings of the <i>Dhamma </i>got obscured. As a
matter of fact, the depth of the <i>Dhamma </i>has to be seen through lucidity,
just as much as one sees the bottom of a tank only when the water is lucid. </span></p>

also, <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i>, when used by itself, means
'name'. However when we come to the commentaries we find some kind of
hesitation to recognize this obvious meaning. Even in the present context, the
commentary, <i>Paramatthajotik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, explains the
word 'name' so as to mean 'bending'. It says that all immaterial states are
called <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i>, in the sense that they bend
towards their respective objects and also because the mind has the nature of
inclination: <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>ramma<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span>bhimukha<span

definition of <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i> in <i>Abhidhamma</i>

in to explain the word <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i>. It may be that
they thought it too simple an interpretation to explain <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma
</i>with reference to 'name', particularly because it is a term that has to do
with deep insight. However as far as the teachings in the <i>suttas </i>are

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Well, this seems lucid enough as a
definition but let us see, whether there is any justification for regarding
feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention as 'name'. Suppose there
is a little child, a toddler, who is still unable to speak or understand
language. Someone gives him a rubber ball and the child has seen it for the
first time. If the child is told that it is a rubber ball, he might not understand
it. How does he get to know that object? He smells it, feels it, and tries to
eat it, and finally rolls it on the floor. At last he understands that it is a
plaything. Now the child has recognised the rubber ball not by the name that
the world has given it, but by those factors included under 'name' in <i>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, namely
feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This shows that the definition of <i>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i>&nbsp;in <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>&nbsp;takes us back to the most fundamental notion
of 'name', to something like its prototype. The world gives a name to an object
for purposes of easy communication. When it gets the sanction of others, it
becomes a convention. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While commenting on the verse just
quoted, the commentator also brings in a bright idea. As an illustration of the
sweeping power of name, he points out that if any tree happens to have no name
attached to it by the world, it would at least be known as the 'nameless tree'.<a
name="_ednref10"></a><a href="#_edn10" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[10]</span></span></a>
Now as for the child, even such a usage is not possible. So it gets to know an
object by the aforesaid method. And the factors involved there, are the most
elementary constituents of name. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now it is this elementary
name-and-form world that a meditator also has to understand, however much he
may be conversant with the conventional world. But if a meditator wants to
understand this name-and-form world, he has to come back to the state of a
child, at least from one point of view. Of course in this case the equanimity
should be accompanied by knowledge and not by ignorance. And that is why a
meditator makes use of mindfulness and full awareness, <i>satisampajaÃ±Ã±a</i>,<i>
</i>in his attempt to understand name-and-form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Even though he is able to
recognize objects by their conventional names, for the purpose of comprehending
name-and-form, a meditator makes use of those factors that are included under
'name': feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention. All these have a
specific value to each individual and that is why the <i>Dhamma</i> has to be
understood each one by himself - <i>paccatta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
veditabbo</i>. This <i>Dhamma</i> has to be realized by oneself. One has to
understand one's own world of name-and-form by oneself. No one else can do it
for him. Nor can it be defined or denoted by technical terms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now it is in this world of
name-and-form that suffering is found. According to the Buddha, suffering is
not out there in the conventional world of worldly philosophers. It is to be
found in this very name-and-form world. So the ultimate aim of a meditator is
to cut off the craving in this name-and-form. As it is said: <i>acchecchi ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> idha n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pe</i>.<a
name="_ednref11"></a><a href="#_edn11" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if we are to bring in a simile
to clarify this point, the Buddha is called the incomparable surgeon, <i>sallakatto
anuttaro</i>.<a name="_ednref12"></a><a href="#_edn12" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[12]</span></span></a>
Also he is sometimes called <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sallassa hant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, one who removes the dart of craving.<a
name="_ednref13"></a><a href="#_edn13" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[13]</span></span></a>
So the Buddha is the incomparable surgeon who pulls out the poison-tipped arrow
of craving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We may say therefore that,
according to the <i>Dhamma</i>, <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, or name-and-form, is like the wound in which
the arrow is embedded. When one is wounded by a poison-tipped arrow, the
bandage has to be put, not on the archer or on his bow-string, but on the wound
itself. First of all the wound has to be well located and cleaned up.
Similarly, the comprehension of name-and-form is the preliminary step in the
treatment of the wound caused by the poison-tipped arrow of craving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And it is for that purpose that a
meditator has to pay special attention to those basic components of 'name' -
feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention - however much he may be
proficient in words found in worldly usage. It may even appear as a process of
unlearning down to childlike simplicity. But of course, the equanimity implied
there, is not based on ignorance but on knowledge. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We find ourselves in a similar
situation with regard to the significance of <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>
in <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>.
Here too we have something deep, but many take <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i> to mean 'mind and matter'. Like materialists,
they think there is a contrast between mind and matter. But according to the <i>Dhamma</i>
there is no such rigid distinction. It is a pair that is interrelated and taken
together it forms an important link in the chain of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca

relation to 'name' and that is to say that form is known with the help of
'name'. As we saw above, that child got a first-hand knowledge of the rubber
ball with the help of contact, feeling, perception, intention and attention.
Now in the definition of 'form' as <i>catt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ri ca

lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> the four great
primaries are mentioned because they constitute the most primary notion of
'form'. Just as much as feeling, perception, intention, contact and attention
represent the most primary notion of 'name', conventionally so called, even so
the four great primaries form the basis for the primary notion of 'form', as
the world understands it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is not an easy matter to
recognize these primaries. They are evasive like ghosts. But out of their
interplay we get the perception of form, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. In fact what is called <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>&nbsp;in
this context is <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
It is with reference to the behaviour of the four great elements that the world
builds up its concept of form. Its perception, recognition and designation of
form is in terms of that behaviour. And that behaviour can be known with the
help of those members representing name. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The earth element is recognized
through the qualities of hardness and softness, the water element through the
qualities of cohesiveness and dissolution, the fire element through hotness and

of form, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,

the ignorance in the world. Therefore insight is the only path of release. And
that is why a meditator practically comes down to the level of a child in order
to understand name and form. He may even have to pretend to be a patient in
slowing down his movements for the sake of developing mindfulness and full

'name' as conventionally so called, but unfortunately this connection is
ignored in the commentaries, when they bring in the idea of 'bending' to
explain the word 'name'. So we need not hesitate to render <i>n<span

on the meaning of the word <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. Here
too one can see some unusual semantic developments in the commentarial period.
It is very common these days to explain the etymology of the word <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>with the help of a phrase like: <i>V<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>t<span

</i>is so called because it is an exit from craving which is a form of weaving.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To take the element <i>v<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i> as some kind of bending. It is said that craving
is a kind of weaving in the sense that it connects up one form of existence
with another and the prefix <i>ni</i> is said to signify the exit from that
weaving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But nowhere in the <i>suttas</i>
do we get this sort of etymology and interpretation. On the other hand it is
obvious that the <i>suttas</i> use the word <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
in the sense of 'extinguishing' or 'extinction'. In fact this is the sense that
brings out the true essence of the <i>Dhamma</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance the <i>Ratanasutta</i>,

Now when a fire burns, it does so with the help of firewood. When a fire is
burning, if someone were to ask us: &quot;What is burning?&quot; - what shall
we say as a reply? Is it the wood that is burning or the fire that is burning?
The truth of the matter is that the wood burns because of the fire and the fire
burns because of the wood. So it seems we already have here a case of
relatedness of this to that, <i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>. </i>This
itself shows that there is a very deep significance in the fire simile. </span></p>

</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>as
a term for the ultimate aim of this <i>Dhamma </i>is equally significant
because of its allusion to the going out of a fire. In the <i>Asa<span

<i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>

the most widely used, probably because of its significant allusion to the fire.

goal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The wandering ascetic <i>Vacchagotta</i>,
as well as many others, accused the Buddha of teaching a doctrine of
annihilation: <i>Sato sattassa uccheda<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vin<span

Their accusation was that the Buddha proclaims the annihilation, destruction
and non-existence of a being that is existent. And the Buddha answered them
fairly and squarely with the fire simile. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Now if a fire is burning in
front of you dependent on grass and twigs as fuel, you would know that it is
burning dependently and not independently, that there is no fire in the
abstract. And when the fire goes out, with the exhaustion of that fuel, you
would know that it has gone out because the conditions for its existence are no
more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a sidelight to the depth of

word <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
used in such contexts has the sense of both 'fuel' as well as 'grasping', and
in fact, fuel is something that the fire grasps for its burning. <i>Up<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The eternalists, overcome by the
craving for existence, thought that there is some permanent essence in
existence as a reality. But what had the Buddha to say about existence? He said
that what is true for the fire is true for existence as well. That is to say
that existence is dependent on grasping. So long as there is a grasping, there
is an existence. As we saw above, the firewood is called <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> because it catches fire. The fire catches hold
of the wood, and the wood catches hold of the fire. And so we call it firewood.
This is a case of a relation of this to that, <i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.

reality. </span></p>

confusion these two words <i>sat</i> and <i>asat</i>, being and non-being, had
created for the philosophers. It was only the Buddha who presented a perfect
solution, after a complete reappraisal of the whole problem of existence. He
pointed out that existence is a fire kept up by the fuel of grasping, so much
so that, when grasping ceases, existence ceases as well. </span></p>

exist, both or neither. The presumption of the questioner is that one or the

That man is simply trying to assuage his pains by the heat of the fire. It is
an attempt to warm up, not to cool down. Similarly what the lustful beings in

Venerable <i>Nanda</i>, who earnestly took up the holy life encouraged by the
Buddha's promise of heavenly nymphs, attained <i>Arahant</i>-hood almost in
spite of himself. At last he approached the Buddha and begged to relieve him of
the onus of his promise. This shows that when one completes the training in the
Holy Life, one is already in <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. Only

glimpse of a distant object is necessary. At whatever moment the Noble
Eightfold Path is perfected, one attains <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>

go on asking: what is the purpose of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>?
And it is to answer this type of question that many scholars go on hair
splitting. Normally in the world, whatever one does has some purpose or other.
All occupations, all trades and businesses, are for gain and profit. Thieves
and burglars also have some purpose in mind. But what is the purpose of trying
to attain <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>? What is the purpose of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>? Why should one attain <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>?
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is to give an answer to this
question that scholars brought in such phrases as <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pana <span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gamma</i>, 'on reaching
<i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>'. They would say that 'on reaching <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>', craving would be destroyed. On closer analysis
it would appear that there is some fallacy in this question. For if there is
any aim or purpose in attaining <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;would not be the ultimate aim. In other
words, if <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is the ultimate aim,
there should be no aim in attaining <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
Though it may well sound a tautology, one has to say that <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is the ultimate aim for the simple reason that
there is no aim beyond it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, this might need more
explanation. Now as far as craving is concerned, it has the nature of
projection or inclination. It is something bent forward, with a forward view,
and that is why it is called <i>bhavanetti</i>, the leader in becoming.<a
name="_ednref45"></a><a href="#_edn45" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[45]</span></span></a>
It leads one on and on in existence, like the carrot before the donkey. So that
is why all objects presented by craving have some object or purpose as a
projection. Craving is an inclination. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But what is the position if one
makes the destruction of craving itself one's object? Now craving because of
its inclining nature is always bent forward, so much so that we get an infinite
progression. This is for that, and that is for the other. As the phrase <i>ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ponobhavik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>implies, craving brings up existence again and
again.<a name="_ednref46"></a><a href="#_edn46" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But this is not the case when one
makes the destruction of craving one's aim. When that aim is attained, there is
nothing more to be done. So this brings us to the conclusion that the term <i>ta<span

full-fledged synonym of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

one may ask. There is a general belief that in the case of a <i>sot<span

is like a glimpse of a distant lamp on a road with many bends and the <i>sot<span

it may be said that the norm of immediacy is applicable even to the knowledge
of the first path. One who attains to the fruit of stream-winning may be a
beggar, an illiterate person, or a seven year old child. It may be that he has
heard the <i>Dhamma</i> for the first time. All the same, a long line of
epithets is used with reference to him in the <i>suttas</i> as his
qualifications: <i>Di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammo pattadhammo

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>, he is
one who has seen the <i>Dhamma</i>, the truth of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
It is said in the <i>Ratanasutta</i> that along with the vision of the first path,
three fetters are abandoned, namely <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, the self-hood view, <i>vicikicch<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa</i>, attachment to
holy vows and ascetic practices.<a name="_ednref55"></a><a href="#_edn55"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[55]</span></span></a>
Some might argue that only these fetters are abandoned at this stage, because
it is a glimpse of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> from a distance.
But then there is this second epithet, <i>pattadhammo</i>, which means that he
has reached the <i>Dhamma</i>, that he has arrived at <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
Not only that, he is <i>viditadhammo</i>, he is one who has understood the <i>Dhamma</i>,
which is <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. He is <i>pariyog<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7735;</span>hadhammo</i>, he has plunged into the <i>Dhamma</i>,
he has dived into the <i>Dhamma</i>, which is <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
He is <i>ti<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>avicikiccho</i>, he has
crossed over doubts. <i>Vigatakatha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>katho</i>,
his waverings are gone. <i>Ves<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rajjappatto</i>, he
has attained to proficiency. <i>Aparappaccayo satthus<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sane</i>,
in regard to the dispensation of the teacher he is not dependent on others. And
that is to say that he could attain to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;even
without another's help, though of course with the teacher's help he would
attain it sooner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So this string of epithets
testifies to the efficacy of the realization by the first path. It is not a
mere glimpse of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> from a distance. It
is a reaching, an arrival or a plunge into <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
For purposes of illustration we may bring in a legend connected with the
history of Sri Lanka. It is said that when King <i>Gajab<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hu</i>
invaded India, one of his soldiers, <i>N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>la</i>,
who had Herculean strength, parted the seawater with a huge iron bar in order
to make way for the king and the army. Now when the supramundane path arises in
the mind the power of thought is as mighty as the blow of <i>N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>la</i>
with his iron bar. Even with the first blow the sea-water parted, so that one
could see the bottom. Similarly the sweeping influxes are parted for a moment
when the transcendental path arises in a mind, enabling one to see the very
bottom - <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. In other words, all
preparations (<i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>)
are stilled for a moment, enabling one to see the cessation of preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have just given a simile by way
of illustration, but incidentally there is a <i>Dhammapada</i> verse which
comes closer to it:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So
this verse clearly indicates what the knowledge of the path does when it arises.
Just as one leaps forward and cuts off a stream of water, so it cuts off, even
for a moment, the preparations connected with craving. Thereby one realizes the
destruction of preparations - <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Like the sea water parted by the
blow of the iron bar, preparations part for a moment to reveal the very bottom
which is 'unprepared', the <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. <i>Akata</i>,
or the un-made, is the same as <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>,
the unprepared. So one has had a momentary vision of the sea bottom, which is
free from preparations. Of course, after that experience, influxes flow in
again. But one kind of influxes, namely <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, influxes of
views, are gone for good and will never flow in again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now how was it that some with keen
wisdom like <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i> attained <i>Arahant</i>-ship
even while listening to a short sermon from the Buddha? They had dealt four
powerful blows in quick succession with the iron bar of the path-knowledge to
clear away all possible influxes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is called <i>akata</i> or <i>asa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>, the un-made or the un-prepared, is not
something out there in a distance, as an object of thought. It is not a sign to
be grasped by one who wants to attain <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Language encourages us to think in
terms of signs. Very often we find it difficult to get rid of this habit. The
worldlings with their defilements have to communicate with each other and the
structure of the language has to answer their needs. So the subject-object
relationship has become a very significant feature in a language. It always
carries the implication that there is a thing to be grasped and that there is
someone who grasps, that there is a doer and a thing done. So it is almost
impossible to avoid such usages as: 'I want to see <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,<i>
</i>I want to attain<i> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>'. We are made to
think in terms of getting and attaining. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However sometimes the Buddha
reminds us that this is only a conventional usage and that these worldly usages
are not to be taken too seriously. We come across such an instance in the <i>Sag<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>thavagga</i> of the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta
Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> where the Buddha retorts to some
questions put by a certain deity.<a name="_ednref57"></a><a href="#_edn57"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[57]</span></span></a>
The deity named <i>Kakudha</i> asks the Buddha: &quot;Do you rejoice, oh
recluse?&quot; And the Buddha retorts: &quot;On getting what, friend?&quot;
Then the deity asks: &quot;Then, recluse, do you grieve?&quot; And the Buddha
quips back: &quot;On losing what, friend?&quot; So the deity concludes:
&quot;Well then, recluse, you neither rejoice nor grieve!&quot; And the Buddha
replies: &quot;That is so, friend.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It seems, then, that though we say
we 'attain' <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> there is nothing to
gain and nothing to lose. If anything - <b>what is lost is an ignorance that
there is something, and a craving that there is not enough</b> - and that is
all one loses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now there are quite a number of
synonyms for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, such as <i>akata</i>
and <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. As already mentioned, there
is even a list of thirty-three such epithets, out of which one is <i>d<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[58]</span></span></a>
Now <i>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>pa</i> means an island. When we are told
that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is an island, we tend to
imagine some sort of existence in a beautiful island. But in the <i>P<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yanavagga </i>of the <i>Sutta
Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i> the Buddha gives a good corrective to
that kind of imagining in his reply to a question put by the Brahmin youth <i>Kappa</i>,
a pupil of <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>var<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>.

just one of the last links, he declares: &quot;decay-and-death, monks, is
impermanent, prepared, dependently arisen, of a nature to get destroyed, to
pass away, fade away and cease.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By the way, the word <i>vir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>&nbsp;usually means detachment or dispassion. But
in such contexts as <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>g<span

one has to render it by words like 'fading away'. So that <i>avijj<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

decay-and-death themselves are impermanent, that they are prepared or made up,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

preceding link <i>j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>, or birth. And that too
is given the same qualifications. In the same manner he takes up each of the
preceding links up to and including ignorance, <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
and applies to them the above qualifications. It is significant that every one
of the twelve links, even ignorance, is said to be dependently arisen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us try to understand how, for
instance, decay-and-death themselves can get destroyed or pass away. Taking the
<i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> formula as a paradigm, we can
illustrate the relationship between the two links birth and decay-and-death.
Instead of saying: this being, that comes to be (and so forth), now we have to
say: birth being, decay-and-death comes to be. With the arising of birth, decay-and-death
arises. Birth not being, decay-and-death does not come to be. With the
cessation of birth, decay-and-death ceases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now birth itself is an arising.
But here we can't help saying that birth 'arises'. It is like saying that birth
is born. How can birth get born? Similarly death is a passing away. But here we
have to say that death itself 'passes away'. How can death pass away? Perhaps,
as we proceed, we might get the answers to these questions.</span></p>

only is the range of wisdom, in so far only is the round kept going for there
to be a designation as the this-ness, that is to say: name-and-form together
with consciousness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have rendered the term <i>itthatta</i>
by 'this-ness', and what it means will become clear as we go on. In the above
quotation the word <i>ett<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i>
</i>which means 'in so far only', has as its point of reference the concluding
phrase <i>yadida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mar<span

complete idea. But some editions have an additional phrase: <i>aÃ±Ã±amaÃ±Ã±apaccayat<span

relationship&quot;. This phrase is obviously superfluous and is probably a
commentarial addition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is meant by the Buddha's
statement is that name-and-form together with consciousness is the rallying
point for all concepts of birth, decay, death and rebirth. All pathways for
verbal expression, terminology and designation converge on name-and-form
together with consciousness. The range of wisdom extends only up to the
relationship between these two. And it is between these two that there is a
whirling round so that one may point out a this-ness. In short, the secret of
the entire <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
existence is to be found in this whirlpool. </span></p>

<i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a</i>
are words used for a whirlpool. We shall be bringing up quotations in support
of that meaning. It seems, however, that this meaning has got obscured in the
course of time. In the commentaries and in some modern translations there is
quite a lot of confusion with regard to the meaning of the phrase <i>va<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vattati</i>.
In fact one Sinhala translation renders it as '<i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i> rain'. What rain has to do with <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> is a matter for
conjecture. What is actually meant by <i>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vattati </i>is a whirling round, and <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, even literally,
is that. Here we are told that there is a whirling round between name-and-form
and consciousness, and this is the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i> whirlpool to which all the aforesaid things are
traceable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

Now from this context it becomes clear that all pathways for verbal expression,
terminology and designation converge on this whirlpool between name-and-form
and consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now that we have attached so much
significance to a whirlpool, let us try to understand how a whirlpool is
formed. Let us try to get at the natural laws underlying its formation. How
does a whirlpool come to be? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Suppose a river is flowing
downward. To flow downward is in the nature of a river. But a certain current
of water thinks: &quot;I can and must move upstream.&quot; And so it pushes on
against the main stream. But at a certain point its progress is checked by the
main stream and is thrust aside, only to come round and make a fresh attempt,
again and again. All these obstinate and unsuccessful attempts gradually lead
to a whirling round. As time goes on, the run-away current understands, as it
were, that it cannot move forward. But it does not give up. It finds an
alternative aim in moving towards the bottom. So it spirals downward,
funnel-like, digging deeper and deeper towards the bottom, until an abyss is
formed. Here then we have a whirlpool. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While all this is going on, there
is a crying need to fill up the chasm, and the whirlpool develops the necessary
force of attraction to cater to it. It attracts and grasps everything that
comes within its reach and sends it whirling down, funnel like, into the chasm.
The whirling goes on at a tremendous speed, while the circumference grows
larger and larger. At last the whirlpool becomes a centre of a tremendous
amount of activity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While this kind of activity is
going on in a river or a sea, there is a possibility for us to point it out as
'that place' or 'this place'. Why? Because there is an activity going on.
Usually, in the world, the place where an activity is going on is known as a
'unit', a 'centre', or an 'institution'. Since the whirlpool is also a centre
of activity, we may designate it as a 'here' or 'there'. We may even personify
it. With reference to it, we can open up pathways for verbal expression,
terminology and designation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But if we are to consider the form
of activity that is going on here, what is it after all? It is only a
perversion. That obstinate current thought to itself, out of delusion and
ignorance: I can and must move upstream. And so it tried and failed, but turned
round only to make the same vain attempt again and again. Ironically enough,
even its <b>progress</b> towards the bottom is a <b>stagnation</b>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So here we have ignorance on one
side and craving on the other, as a result of the abyss formed by the
whirlpool. In order to satisfy this craving there is that power of attraction:
grasping. Where there is <b>grasping</b>, there is <b>existence</b>, or <b><i>bhava</i></b>.
The entire whirlpool now appears as a centre of activity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now the basic principle underlying
this whirlpool is to be found in our bodies. What we call 'breathing' is a
continuous process of emptying and filling up. So even the so-called
'life-principle' is not much different from the activity of a whirlpool. The
functioning of the lungs and the heart is based on the same principle and the
blood circulation is in fact a whirling round. This kind of activity is very
often known as 'automatic', a word which has connotations of <b>self</b>-sufficiency.
But at the root of it there is a perversion, as we saw in the case of the
whirlpool. All these activities are based on a conflict between two opposite
forces. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact existence in its entirety
is not much different from the conflict of that obstinate current of water with
the main stream. This characteristic of conflict is so pervasive that it can be
seen even in the basic laws governing the existence of a society. In our social
life, rights and responsibilities go hand in hand. We can enjoy certain
privileges, provided we fulfil our duties. So here too we have a tangle within
and a tangle without.<a name="_ednref66"></a><a href="#_edn66" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[66]</span></span></a> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this is about the existence of
the society as such. And what about the field of economics? There too the basic
principles show the same weakness. Production is governed by laws of supply and
demand. There will be a supply so long as there is a demand. Between them there
is a conflict. It leads to many complications. The price mechanism is on a
precarious balance and that is why some wealthy countries are forced to the
ridiculous position of dumping their surplus into the sea. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this shows that existence is
basically in a precarious position. To illustrate this, let us take the case of
two snakes of the same size, trying to swallow up each other. Each of them tries
to swallow up the other from the tail upwards and when they are half way
through the meal, what do we find? A <b>snake cycle</b>. This snake cycle goes
round and round, trying to swallow up each other. But will it ever be
successful? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The precarious position
illustrated by the snake cycle, we find in our own bodies in the form of
respiration, blood circulation and so forth. What appears as the stability in
the society and in the economy, is similarly precarious. It is because of this
conflict, this unsatisfactoriness, that the Buddha concluded that the whole of
existence is suffering. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When the arising aspect is taken
too seriously, to the neglect of the cessation aspect, instead of a conflict or
an unsatisfactoriness one tends to see something automatic everywhere. This
body as well as machines such as water pumps and electrical appliances seem to
work on an automatic principle. But in truth there is only a conflict between
two opposing forces. When one comes to think of it, there is no '<b>auto</b>'-ness
even in the automatic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All that is there, is a bearing up
with difficulty. And this in fact is the meaning of the word <i>dukkha</i>. <i>Du<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7717;</span></i> stands for 'difficulty' and <i>kha</i> for
'bearing up'. <b>Even with difficulty one bears it up, and though one bears it
up, it is difficult</b>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now regarding the question of
existence we happened to mention that because of a whirlpool's activity, one
can point out a '<b>here</b>' with reference to it. We can now come back to the
word <i>itthatta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, which we left out without
comment in the quotation <i>ett<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vat<span

far only does the whirlpool whirl for the designation of an <i>itthatta.</i>&quot;
Now what is this <i>itthatta</i>? <i>Ittha</i>&nbsp;means 'this', so <i>itthatta<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We saw above how the concept of a

time the birth of a 'here' or 'this place'. And that is what is meant by <i>itthabh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i> in the two verses quoted above. <i>Itthabh<span

both verses this 'this-ness' is coupled with an otherwise-ness,<i> aÃ±Ã±ath<span

a conflict between two things, this-ness and otherwise-ness. The cycle of <i>sa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though we have given so much
significance to the two terms <i>itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va </i>and
<i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>,
the commentary to the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i> treats
them lightly. It explains <i>itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va<span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[69]</span></span></a>
This explanation misses the deeper significance of the word <i>itthatta</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In support of this we may refer to
the <i>P<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7789;</span>ikasutta </i>of the <i>D<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>gha Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. There we
are told that when the world system gets destroyed at the end of an aeon, some
being or other gets reborn in an empty Brahma mansion, and after being there
for a long time, thinks, out of a feeling of loneliness: <i>Aho vata aÃ±Ã±epi
satt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> itthatta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>gaccheyyu<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>.</i><a name="_ednref70"></a><a href="#_edn70" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[70]</span></span></a>
&quot;How nice it would be if other beings also come to this state&quot;. In
this context the word <i>itthatta</i> refers to the Brahma world and not the
human world. From the point of view of the Brahmas, <i>itthatta</i> refers to
the Brahma world and only for us here, it means the human world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However this is just a narrow
meaning of the word <i>itthatta</i>. When the reference is to the entire round
of existence or <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
<i>itthatta</i> does not necessarily mean 'this human world'. The two terms
have a generic sense, because they represent some basic principle. As in the
case of a whirlpool, this-ness is to be seen together with an otherwise-ness.
This illustrates the conflict characteristic of existence. Wherever a this-ness
arises, a possibility for an otherwise-ness comes in. <i>Itthabh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va </i>and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i> go together. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Aniccat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>, or
impermanence, is very often explained with the help of the phrase <i>vipari<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span>maÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>.<a name="_ednref71"></a><a href="#_edn71"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[71]</span></span></a>
Now here too we have the word <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>. Here the word preceding it, gives a clue to its
true significance. <i>Vipari<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span>ma </i>is
quite suggestive of a process of evolution. Strictly speaking, <i>pari<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span>ma</i> is evolution, and <i>pari<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ata</i> is the fully evolved or mature stage. The
prefix <i>vi</i> stands for the anti-climax. The evolution is over, now it is
becoming other. Ironically enough, this state of 'becoming-other' is known as
otherwise-ness, <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>.
And so this twin, <i>itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va </i>and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>, tell us the
nature of the world. Between them, they explain for us the law of impermanence.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the Section-of-the-Threes in
the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>
the three characteristics of a <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>
are explained in this order: <i>Upp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>do paÃ±Ã±<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This implies that the persistence
is only apparent and that is why it is mentioned last. There is an

&quot;arising, persistence and breaking up&quot;. However the law of
impermanence could be sufficiently understood even with the help of two words, <i>itthabh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va </i>and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>, this-ness and otherwise-ness. Very often we
find the Buddha summing up the law of impermanence in the two words <i>samudaya
</i>and <i>vaya</i>, &quot;arising&quot; and &quot;passing away&quot;.<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is an apparent contradiction
in the phrase <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>hitassa aÃ±Ã±athatta</i>, but it
reminds us of the fact that what the world takes as static or persisting is
actually not so. The so-called 'static' is from beginning to end an
otherwise-ness. Now if we are to relate this to the two links <i>j<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i> and <i>jar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mara<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> in <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, we
may say that as soon as one is born the process of otherwise-ness sets in.
Wherever there is birth, there is death. One of the traditional <i>P<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>li</i> verses on the reflections on death has the
following meaningful lines: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Uppattiy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[75]</span></span></a>
&quot;always death has come, even with the birth itself.&quot; Just as in a
conjoined pair, when one is drawn the other follows, even so when birth is
drawn in, decay-and-death follow as a matter of course. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Before the advent of the Buddha,
the world believed in the possibility of a birth devoid of decay-and-death. It
believed in a form of existence devoid of grasping. Because of its ignorance of
the pair-wise relatedness of this-to-that, <i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
it went on with its deluded search. And that was the reason for all the
conflict in the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the teaching of the
Buddha, the concept of birth is equivalent to the concept of a 'here'. As a
matter of fact, this birth of a 'here' is like the first peg driven for the
measurement of a world. Because of the pair-wise relationship, the very first '<b>birthday-present</b>'
that one gets as soon as one is born, is - <b>death</b>. The inevitable death
that he is entitled to. This way we can understand the deeper significance of
the two words <i>itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va </i>and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>, this-ness and
otherwise-ness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have to say the same thing with
regard to the whirlpool. Apparently it has the power to control, to hold sway.
Seen from a distance, the whirlpool is a centre of activity with some
controlling power. Now, one of the basic meanings of the concept of self is the
ability to control, to hold sway. And a whirlpool too, as seen from a distance,
seems to have this ability. Just as it appears automatic, so also it seems to
have some power to control. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But on deeper analysis it reveals
its <b>not-self</b> nature. What we have here is simply the conflict between
the main stream and a run-away current. It is the outcome of the conflict
between two forces and not the work of just one force. It is a case of
relatedness of this-to-that, <i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
As one verse in the <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lavagga</i> of the <i>Dhammapada</i>

nothing really automatic about it. This then is the <i>dukkha</i>, the
suffering, the conflict, the unsatisfactoriness. What the world holds on to as

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As regards this whirlpool, to show
a parallel development with the links of the law of dependent arising, by way
of a sustained simile, we may say that the ignorance in presuming that it is
possible to go against the main stream of the three signata - impermanence,
suffering and not-self - is the place of its origin. That heap of preparations
impelled by ignorance, which takes the current forward, may be regarded as <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>. And where the
current in its progress clashes with the main stream to become a whirlpool,
that pushing forward against the main stream is <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>
or consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The outcome of the clash is <i>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, or
name-and-form, with its formal name and nominal form. That link in the formula
of dependent arising called <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>yatana</i>,
or six sense-bases, could be regarded as the outgrowth of this name-and-form.We
can understand that link, too, in relation to the simile of the whirlpool. As
the whirlpool goes on for a long time, an abyss is formed, the functioning of
which could be compared to the six sense-bases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When one comes to think about that
statement, it would appear that the thirst of craving arises in beings in
various forms of existence because of painful feeling. The <i>Sallattenasutta</i>
adds to this by stating that the uninstructed worldling, on being touched by
painful feeling, delights in sense pleasures, because he knows no way out of
painful feeling other than the sense pleasures.<a name="_ednref87"></a><a
href="#_edn87" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the light of that statement it
seems that the abyss is the endless barrage of painful feelings. The force of
attraction that arises from the abyss is like the thirst to quell those painful
feelings. The grasping that follows is the functioning of the same force of
attraction. It attracts all the flotsam and jetsam around it, as things
organically appropriated, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dinna</i>, to put
up a show of existence, or <i>bhava</i>. That is, a spot that can be pointed
out with the help of things thus grasped by the whirlpool. So this whirlpool or
vortex simile gives us some idea of the law of dependent arising. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The insight into the basic
principle of dependent arising, is in fact regarded as the arising of the 'eye

sums up the significance of that <i>Dhamma</i>-eye, comes up quite often in the

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sometimes it is briefly alluded to
with the couple of terms <i>samudaya</i> and <i>nirodha</i>, as <i>samudayo

href="#_edn89" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:

found expression as an exclamation: &quot;Arising, arising! Ceasing,
ceasing!&quot; The above phrase only connects up the two aspects of that
experience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It seems then that what is called
the '<i>Dhamma-</i>eye', is the ability to see the <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic</i>
solution in the very vortex of the <i>sams<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
problem. That way of analysis which puts <i>sams<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>
and <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> far apart, into two watertight
compartments, as it were, gives rise to interminable problems. But here we see
that, just as much as one could realize <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
by discovering the cause of suffering and following the path to its cessation,
which in effect is the understanding of the four noble truths, one could also
put an end to this vortex by understanding its cause and applying the correct
means for its cessation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the previous sermon we happened
to quote some Canonical verses, which declared that the vortex does not exist
for an <i>arahant</i>.<a name="_ednref90"></a><a href="#_edn90" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[90]</span></span></a>
Now as regards the condition after the cessation of the vortex, if someone asks
where the vortex or the whirlpool has gone, what sort of answer can we give? It
is the same difficulty that comes up in answering the question: &quot;Where has
the fire gone after it has gone out?&quot; Because here too, what we call the
whirlpool is that current of water which went against the main stream. It also
consists of water, like the body of water outside it. So we cannot say that
they united, nor can we say that it went and hid somewhere. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we find ourselves in a queer
situation. All we can say in fairness to truth is that there had been a certain
form of activity, a certain state of unrest, due to certain causes and
conditions. Because of that activity that was going on there, it was possible
to designate it, to give it a name. By worldly convention one could refer to it
as &quot;that place&quot; or &quot;this place&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The entire field of activity was
called a whirlpool by worldly convention. But now, the so-called whirlpool is
no more. The worldly convention is no more applicable as in the case of an
extinguished fire. The word &quot;fire&quot; was introduced, the concept of
&quot;fire&quot; was created, to designate a certain state of affairs that
arose due to causes and conditions, due to graspings. So from this also we can
see that it is in concepts that ignorance finds a camouflage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Being unaware of it the world goes
on amassing concepts and even expects to see them in <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na.
</i>There are some who fondly hope to get a vision of their lists of concepts
when they realize <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. But that wisdom penetrates
through even the concepts and that is why it is called <i>udayatthag<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

implicit in the phrase<i> ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> kiÃ±ci

&quot;whatever is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease&quot;.
If anything has the nature to arise, by that very nature it is bound to come to
its end. And that is why the wandering ascetic <i>Upatissa</i>, who was to
become Venerable <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta</i> later, attained
the fruit of a stream-winner even on hearing the first two lines of the verse

of radical reflection, or <i>yoniso manasik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
literally: &quot;attention by way of the matrix&quot;. One might as well say
that it is an attention by way of the vortex. It is as if a man with keen
vision, sitting under a tree by a river, were to watch how a fallen leaf gets
carried away by the water current, only to get whirled up and disappear in a

and passing away of the five grasping groups and that before long his mind was
fully emancipated from the influxes and that he attained to full enlightenment.
It is also said in the <i>sutta</i>&nbsp;in this connection that the <i>bodhisatta</i>
followed this mode of reflection, because he understood that it is the way of
insight leading to awakening: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

important point, the pivotal point, in this path of insight, is the relationship
between name-and-form and consciousness. The commentary raises the question,
why the <i>bodhisatta</i> <i>Vipass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>makes no
mention of the first two links, <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>and <i>sa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

very ignorance regarding the relationship between name-and-form and
consciousness - is <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. And what
accounts for the continuity of this relationship - is <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. It is because of
these preparations that the vortical interplay between consciousness and
name-and-form is kept going. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Simply because the first two links
are not mentioned in the <i>sutta</i>, the commentators give the explanation
that they belong to the past. But it should be clear that the <i>bodhisatta
Vipass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>could not have aroused the <i>Dhamma</i>-eye
without those two links. Why they are not specially mentioned here is because
they are in the background. It is true that there is a mode of exposition, in
which <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or ignorance, takes
precedence. But what we have here is a different mode of exposition, according
to which one has to stop short at the interrelation between consciousness and
name-and-form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As to the cause of this mutual
relationship, we have to go back to the vortex simile. Usually, the progress of
a current of water is visible at some distance away from the vortex. In this
case, the current of water forgets its own impermanent, suffering and not-self
nature, and goes ahead in search of a permanent, pleasurable and self nature.
And this itself - is <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or ignorance.
This very tendency of the narrow water current to push on against the main body
of water, is itself what is called consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, in the context of the <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>individual,
what forms the background for the interplay between consciousness and
name-and-form, is the non-understanding that the net result of the interplay is
suffering, that it only leads to suffering. In other words, it is the tendency
to go ahead in search of a state of permanence, pleasure and self, ignoring the
three characteristics of impermanence, suffering and not-self. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The heap of preparations or
efforts arising out of that tendency are the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>s</i>. It is on these
very preparations or efforts that consciousness depends, and then we have
name-and-form existing in relation to it. On the side of name-and-form, or
beyond it, we have all the other links of the <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca
samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>. So in this way we can form a mental
picture of the formula of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i> by some sort of a pictorial explanation. It
seems, then, that this discourse is further proof of the statements found in
the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Nid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>.

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is yet another discourse,
one preached by Venerable <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta</i>, which
supports our conclusions. It is found in the <i>Nid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta </i>of the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta
Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. There Venerable <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta
</i>brings out a simile that is even simpler than the vortex simile. He
compares consciousness and name-and-form to two bundles of reeds. When two
bundles of reeds stand, one supporting the other, if one of those is drawn out,
the other would fall down. And if the latter is drawn out, the former will fall
down: <i>Eka<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>ka<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7693;&#7693;</span>heyya,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The mutual interrelation between
consciousness and name-and-form is like that of two bundles of reeds, mutually
supporting each other. Having given this simile, Venerable <i>S<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta </i>goes on to mention the other links of the <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da </i>formula,
as in the case of the <i>bodhisatta Vipass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>'s </i>insight.
It runs: &quot;Dependent on name-and-form, the six sense-bases; dependent on
the six sense-bases, contact; dependent on contact, feelings&quot; (and so on).
And then the cessation aspect of these links is also given. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of illustration, let us
suppose that the consciousness bundle of reeds is standing on the left side,
and the name-and-form bundle is on the right. Then we have a number of other
bundles, such as the six sense-bases, contact and feeling, all leaning on to
the name-and-form bundle of reeds. These are all dependent on the name-and-form
bundle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, as soon as the consciousness
bundle is drawn out, all the others on the right side fall down immediately.
There is no interval. True to the qualities of the <i>Dhamma</i>, summed up in the
terms<i> sandi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hika</i>,<i> ak<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lika </i>and <i>ehipassika</i>, that is, to be seen
here and now, not involving time, and inviting to come and see, the entire mass
of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>suffering
ceases immediately. So, this discourse is further proof of the fact that we
have here quite a different state of affairs, than what is commonly believed to
be the significance of the <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i> formula. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That is why we have pointed out
that the concepts of birth, decay-and-death are of the nature of fading away.
That is also why decay-and-death have been described as impermanent, made up,
dependently arisen, of a nature to wither away, pass away, fade away and cease:

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When one comes to think of it, one
may find it difficult to understand why decay-and-death are called impermanent
and withering or decaying. But the reason is that all concepts, in so far as
they are leaning on to the name-and-form bundle, have to fall down when the
opposite bundle of reeds is drawn out. That is to say that the entire mass of <i>sa<span

ceases immediately, and the whirlpool of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span

of the <i>Dhamma</i> is in fact the law of dependent arising itself. Now there

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though we all have faith in these
qualities of the <i>Dhamma</i>, let us see whether the traditionally accepted
interpretation of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i> is faithful to these qualities, particularly to
the two qualities <i>sandi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hiko</i> and <i>ak<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to that accepted
interpretation, presented by the venerable author of the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>,
the first two links of the formula belong to the past, and the last two links
belong to the future. The remaining eight links in the middle are taken to
represent the present.<a name="_ednref102"></a><a href="#_edn102" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And that is why they explained
that the <i>bodhisatta Vipass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>did not see the
first two links. Perhaps, the presumption is, that since these two links belong
to the past, they can be seen only by the knowledge of the recollection of past
lives. But on the other hand, the <i>suttas</i> tell us that even the
stream-winner has a clear understanding of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The 'noble norm' is none other
than the law of dependent arising, and the stream-winner has seen it well, penetrated
into it well with wisdom. The prefix <i>su-</i> implies the clarity of that
vision. The question, then, is how a stream-winner, who has no knowledge of the
recollection of past lives, can get this insight. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Whatever it may be, the accepted
interpretation, as already mentioned, puts the first two links into the past.
That is to say, ignorance and preparations are referred to the past. Birth,
decay-and-death are referred to the future. The eight links in between are
explained with reference to the present. Thus the formula is divided into three
periods. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Not only that, in the attempt to
interpret the formula as referring to three stages in the <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>journey of an
individual, additional links had to be interposed to prop up the
interpretation.<a name="_ednref104"></a><a href="#_edn104" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[104]</span></span></a>
Ignorance, preparations, craving, grasping and becoming are regarded as the
past causes. Depending on these past causes, consciousness, name-and-form, six
sense-bases, contact and feeling are said to arise as results in the present.
And again, with ignorance, preparations, craving, grasping and becoming as
present causes, consciousness, name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact and
feeling arise as results in the future. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This kind of interpretation is
also advanced. But this interpretation in terms of pentads violates the
interrelatedness between the twelve links in the formula. We have already drawn
attention to the fact of interrelation between the two links in each pair. In
fact, that itself has to be taken as the law of dependent arising. That is the
basic principle itself: Because of one, the other arises. With its cessation,
the other ceases. There is this mode of analysis, but then it is disrupted by
the attempt to smuggle in additional links into the formula. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Furthermore, according to this
accepted commentarial exegesis, even the term <i>bhava</i>, or becoming, is
given a twofold interpretation. As <i>kamma</i>-process-becoming and
rebirth-process-becoming. In the context <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napaccaya bhavo</i>, dependent on grasping is becoming,
it is explained as rebirth-process-becoming, while in the case of the other
context, <i>bhavapaccaya j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>, dependent on
becoming is birth, it is taken to mean <i>kamma</i>-process-becoming. So the
same term is explained in two ways. Similarly, the term <i>j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>,
which generally means birth, is said to imply rebirth in the context of the
formula of dependent arising. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There are many such weak points in
the accepted interpretation. Quite a number of authoritative modern scholars
have pointed this out. Now all these short-comings could be side-tracked, if we
grant the fact, as already mentioned, that the secret of the entire <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>vortex is
traceable to the two links consciousness and name-and-form. As a matter of
fact, the purpose of the formula of dependent arising is to show the way of
arising and cessation of the entire mass of suffering, and not to illustrate
three stages in the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>saric</i> journey of an
individual. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The distinctive feature of this
law of dependent arising is its demonstrability in the present, as suggested by
the terms 'to be seen here and now' and 'timeless', even as the <i>bodhisatta
Vipass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>discovered it, through radical
reflection itself. The salient characteristic of the teaching of the Buddha is
its visibility here and now and timelessness. This fact is well revealed by the
<i>Hemakasutta</i> of the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>. The
<i>brahmin </i>youth <i>Hemaka</i> sings praise of the Buddha&nbsp;in the

of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. &quot;Was I in the

craving in the world.&quot; <i>Hemaka's </i>praise of the Buddha<i> </i>was
inspired by this most distinctive feature in the <i>Dhamma</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have already stated that by '<i>Dhamma</i>'
is meant the law of dependent arising. This is further proof that the basic
principle underlying the formula of dependent arising could be traced to the
constant relationship between consciousness and name-and-form, already present
in one's mental continuum, without running into the past or leaping towards the
future. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We know that, in order to ascertain
whether a banana trunk is pith-less, it is not necessary to go on removing its
bark, layer after layer, from top to bottom. We only have to take a sharp sword
and cut the trunk in the middle, so that the cross-section will reveal to us
its pith-less nature. Similarly, if we cut in the middle the banana trunk of
preparations with the sharp sword of wisdom, <i>paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>maya<span

involving time. It is with such a conviction that the noble disciple utters the
words: &quot;Arising, arising! Cessation, cessation!&quot; That is how he
arrives at the realization summed up in the phrase: </span></p>

&quot;Whatever is of the nature to arise, all that is of the nature to

short-comings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To take up another simile, we have
already alluded to the fact that the Buddha has been compared to a physician.<a

Though this might well sound a modernism, we may say that a specialist doctor today
needs only a drop of blood or blood tissue for a full diagnosis of a patient's
disease. When seen under the microscope, that blood tissue reveals the
pathological condition of the patient. Even the patient himself could be
invited to see for himself the result of the blood test. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But once the disease has been
cured, the doctor could invite the patient again to undergo a blood test, if he
likes to assure himself of the fact that that disease has been effectively
treated. The Buddha's teaching has a similar 'here and now' and timeless
quality. What is noteworthy is that this quality is found in the law of
dependent arising. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then there is another question
that crops up out of this traditional interpretation of the formula of
dependent arising. That is, the reason why the two links, ignorance and
preparations, are referred to the past. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In some discourses, like the <i>Mah<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Nid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>, there is
a discussion about a descent of consciousness into a mother's womb.<a
name="_ednref110"></a><a href="#_edn110" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[110]</span></span></a>
Simply because there is such a discussion, one might think that the law of
dependent arising has reference to a period beyond one's conception in a
mother's womb. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But if we carefully examine the
trend of this discussion and analyse its purpose, such a conclusion will appear
to be groundless. The point which the Buddha was trying to drive home into
Venerable <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda </i>by his catechism, is that
the constant interrelation that exists between consciousness and name-and-form
is present even during one's life in the mother's womb. This catechism can be
analysed into four parts. The first question is: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>? And Venerable <i><span

bhante</i>. &quot;If, <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>, consciousness
were not to descend into a mother's womb, would name-and-form remain
there?&quot; &quot;It would not, Lord.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha is asking whether
name-and-form can persist in remaining inside the mother's womb, if
consciousness refuses to descend into it, so to say. The word <i>samuccissatha</i>&nbsp;presents
a difficulty as regards etymology. But it is quite likely that it has to do
with the idea of remaining, as it has an affinity to the word <i>ucci<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha</i>, left over, remnant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the point raised here is that,
in the event of a non-descent of consciousness into the mother's womb,
name-and-form will not be left remaining there. Name-and-form has to have the
support of consciousness. However, in this interrelation, it is consciousness
that decides the issue. If consciousness does not descend, name-and-form will
not remain there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So even if, at the moment of
death, one has a thought of some mother's womb, if consciousness does not
descend in the proper manner, name-and-form cannot stay there. Name-and-form
has always to be understood in relation to consciousness. It is not something
that is to be found in trees and rocks. It always goes hand in hand with
consciousness. So, the upshot of the above discussion is that name-and-form
will not remain there without the support of consciousness. </span></p>

both consciousness and name-and-form must be there. We can understand, then,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is emphasized here, is the
importance of consciousness. Out of the two, namely consciousness and
name-and-form, what carries more weight with it, is consciousness, even if
there be a trace of name-and-form. What the above questionnaire makes clear, is
that name-and-form arises in a mother's womb because of consciousness. But that
name-and-form will not remain there, if consciousness does not properly descend
into the womb. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Also, if consciousness, after its
descent, were to slip out, name-and-form will not reach the state of a
this-ness. So much so that, even after one's birth as a boy or girl, if
consciousness gets cut off in some way or other, name-and-form will not reach
growth and maturity. So from all this, it is clear that consciousness is an
essential condition for there to be name-and-form. Then the Buddha introduces
the fourth step: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this fourth point is extremely
important. What it implies is that, though the aforesaid is the normal state of

if for some reason or other consciousness does not get established on name-and-form,

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So from this discussion, too, it
is obvious that, simply because there is a reference to a mother's womb in it,
we cannot conclude that ignorance and preparations are past causes. It only
highlights the mutual relationship between consciousness and name-and-form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now the question that comes up
next is: &quot;How does consciousness not get established on name-and-form? In
what respects does it not get established, and how?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The consciousness of a <i>sa<span

always an established consciousness. It is in the nature of this consciousness
to find a footing on name-and-form. These two go together. That is why in the <i>Sampas<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>yasutta </i>of the <i>D<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>gha Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya </i>it is
mentioned in the discussion on the attainments to vision, <i>dassanasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>patti</i>, that a person with such an attainment sees a
man's stream of consciousness that is not cut off on either side, established
in this world and in the next: <i>Purisassa ca viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>asota<span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[112]</span></span></a>
What is implied here is the established nature of consciousness. The
consciousness of a <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric
</i>individual is established both in this world and in the next. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Another attainment of vision,
mentioned in the <i>sutta</i>, concerns the seeing of a man's stream of
consciousness not cut off on either side, and not established in this world or
in the next. And that is a reference to the consciousness of an <i>arahant</i>.
So an <i>arahant's</i> consciousness is an unestablished consciousness, whereas
the consciousness of the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric
</i>individual is an established consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That is precisely why in the <i>Sag<span

Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> and in the <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ratthapak<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sin<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>, where the
episode of Venerable <i>Godhika's</i> suicide is mentioned, it is said that,
though he cut his own neck intending to commit suicide, he was able to attain <i>parinibb<span

But <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> took him to be an ordinary person
and hovered around in search of his consciousness - in vain. The Buddha, on the

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>&nbsp;individual
is always established. The above mentioned relationship is always there.
Because of this we can say that there is always a knot in the consciousness of
the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
individual. For him, this world and the next world are tied together in a knot.
In this case, what is needed, is only the untying of the knot. There is no need
of a fresh tying up, as the knot is already there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

or rebirth-linking-consciousness, is now so widely used that we cannot help
making use of it, even in relating a <i>J<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taka</i>
story. The idea is that, after the death-consciousness, there occurs a
rebirth-linking-consciousness. However, some scholars even raise the question,
why a term considered so important is not to be found in the discourses. On
many an occasion the Buddha speaks about the descent into a womb. But apart
from using such terms as <i>okkanti</i>,<a name="_ednref115"></a><a

have used the term <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isandhi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is meant by this term <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isandhi</i>? It seems to imply a tying up of two existences.
After death there is a 'relinking'. We have mentioned above, in connection with
the simile of the bundles of reeds that, when the consciousness bundle of reeds
is drawn, the name-and-form bundle of reeds falls. And when the name-and-form
bundle of reeds is drawn, the consciousness bundle of reeds falls. And that
there is a relationship of mutuality condition between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The question, then, is why a tying
up is brought in, while granting the relationship by mutuality condition.
Because, going by the same simile, it would be tantamount to saying that
rebirth-linking-consciousness straightens up when death-consciousness falls, as
if, when one bundle of reeds is drawn, the other straightens up. This
contradicts the nature of mutuality condition. There is no timelessness here.
Therefore <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isandhi</i> is a term that needs
critical scrutiny. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The mental continuum of a <i>sa<span

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[118]</span></span></a> And it is already implicit in
the relationship between consciousness and name-and-form. What happens at the
dying moment is usually posed as a deep problem. But if we carefully examine
the situation in the light of Canonical discourses, we could see here an
illustration of the law of dependent arising itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now as far as this established
consciousness and the unestablished consciousness are concerned, we have
already drawn attention to the relationship between a 'here' and a 'there'. We
came across the term <i>itthatta</i>, otherwise called <i>itthabh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>. As a rendering for it, we have used the term
'this-ness'. And then we have already pointed out that this <i>itthabh<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>, or
otherwise-ness. That is to say, wherever a this-ness arises, wherever a concept

transformation or change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This-ness and other-wiseness are
therefore to be found in a pair-wise combination. Wherever there is a
this-ness, there itself is an otherwise-ness. So in this way, because of the
fact that, due to this this-ness itself, wherever this-ness arises,
otherwise-ness arises, together with it, wherever there is a 'there', there is
always a 'here'. This, then, is how the consciousness of the <i>sa<span

is a certain whirling round going on between consciousness and name-and-form.
It is because of that whirling motion, which could either be circular or oval
shaped, that consciousness and name-and-form could either get drawn apart, or
drawn in, as they go round and round in a kind of vortical interplay. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So in a situation like the one
mentioned above, for that person, the distant has become near. At the start,
when he fell to thinking, it was a 'there' for him. Then it became a 'here'.
And the here became a 'there'. This brings out, in a subtle way, the relevance
of these concepts to the question of understanding such teachings as the law of
dependent arising. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Concepts of a here and a there are
in a way relative. They presuppose each other. <i>Itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>,
this-ness, and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>,
otherwise-ness, referred to above, mean the same thing. <i>Itthabh<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>. They are bound in
a pair-wise combination. When you drag in one, the other follows of necessity.
It is the same in the case of the relationship between birth on the one hand,
and decay-and-death on the other, as already mentioned. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Also, consciousness and
name-and-form always move in an orbit. It is not something like the journey of
the body. Thought goes, but it rests on consciousness, it gravitates towards
consciousness. It is because consciousness also has gone there that we say
someone is 'immersed' or 'engrossed' in some thought. It is consciousness that
carries more weight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is sufficiently clear even
from the <i>Dhamma</i> discussion of the Buddha, quoted above. If consciousness
does not descend into a mother's womb, name-and-form will not remain there. If
consciousness does not join in to provide the opportunity, it will not grow.
This is the nature of the relationship between them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though not well authenticated,
cases have been reported of persons, on the verge of death, going through such
unusual experiences as visualizing their own body from some outside standpoint.
Taking into consideration the above mentioned relationship, this is quite
understandable. That external standpoint might not be a place which has the
ability to sustain that consciousness, or which is capable of creating a new
body out of the four primary elements. All the same, it temporarily escapes and
goes there and is now wavering to decide, whether or not to come back to the
body, as it were. It is on such occasions that one visualizes one's own body
from outside. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So here we have the norm of the
mind's behaviour. Seen in this way, there is no need for a fresh tying up, or
relinking, because it is the same vortex that is going on all the time. In the
context of this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
vortex, the 'there' becomes a 'here', and a 'here' becomes a 'there'. The
distant becomes a near, and a near becomes a distant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is owing to this state of
affairs that the consciousness of the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i> individual is said to be always established.
There is a certain twin character about it. Whenever consciousness leaves this
body for good, it goes and rests on a name-and-form object which it had already
taken up. In other words, this is why the Buddha did not find it necessary to
coin a new term to express the idea of conception in some mother's womb. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Consciousness has as its object
name-and-form. It is precisely because of consciousness that one can speak of
it as a name-and-form. It is like the shadow that falls on consciousness.
Name-and-form is like an image. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in taking a photograph, there
is a similar turn of events. Even if one does not pose for the photograph with
so much make-up, even if one turns one's back to the camera, at least a shade
of his shape will be photographed as an image, if not his form. Similarly, in the
case of the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
individual, even if he does not entertain an intention or thought construct, if
he has at least the latency, <i>anusaya</i>, that is enough for him to be
reborn in some form of existence or other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

does not transcend the round, which is of the nature of a this-ness and an otherwise-ness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is further proof that the two
terms imply a circuit. It is a circuit between a 'here' and a 'there', or a
'this-ness' and an 'otherwise-ness'. It is a turning round, an alternation or a
circuitous journey. It is like a rotation on the spot. It is an ambivalence
between a here and a there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the relationship between
this this-ness and otherwise-ness that we tried to illustrate with quotations
from the <i>suttas</i>. We mentioned in particular that consciousness, when it
leaves this body and gets well established on a preconceived object, which in
fact is its name-and-form object, that name-and-form attains growth and
maturity there itself.<a name="_ednref124"></a><a href="#_edn124" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[124]</span></span></a>
Obviously, therefore, name-and-form is a necessary condition for the sustenance
and growth of consciousness in a mother's womb. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It should be clearly understood
that the passage of consciousness from here to a mother's womb is not a
movement from one place to another, as in the case of the body. In reality, it
is only a difference of point of view, and not a transmigration of a soul. In
other words, when consciousness leaves this body and comes to stay in a
mother's womb, when it is fully established there, 'that' place becomes a
'this' place. From the point of view of that consciousness, the 'there' becomes
a 'here'. Consequently, from the new point of view, what was earlier a 'here',
becomes a 'there'. What was formerly 'that place' has now become 'this place'
and vice versa. That way, what actually is involved here, is a change of point
of view. So it does not mean completely leaving one place and going to another,
as is usually meant by the journey of an individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The process, then, is a sort of
going round and round. This is all the more clear by the Buddha's statement
that even consciousness is dependently arisen. There are instances in which the
view that this selfsame consciousness fares on in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> by itself, <i>tadevida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On the one hand, for the
sustenance and growth of name-and-form in a mother's womb, consciousness is
necessary. On the other hand, consciousness necessarily requires an object for
its stability. It could be some times an intention, or else a thought
construct. In the least, it needs a trace of latency, or <i>anusaya</i>. This
fact is clear enough from the <i>sutta </i>quotations we brought up towards the
end of the previous sermon. From the <i>Cetan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta</i>,<i>
</i>we happened to quote on an earlier occasion, it is obvious that at least a
trace of latency is necessary for the sustenance of consciousness.<a

established in a mother's womb, with this condition in the least, name-and-form
begins to grow. It grows, at it were, with a flush of branches, in the form of
the six sense bases, to produce a fresh tree of suffering. It is this idea that
is voiced by the following well known verse in the <i>Dhammapada</i>:</span></p>

journey of a being. In the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara Nik<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Anusaya</span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>, or
latency, is a word of special significance. What is responsible for rebirth, or
<i>punabbhava</i>, is craving, which very often has the epithet <i>ponobhavik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> attached to it. The latency to craving is
particularly instrumental in giving one yet another birth to fare on in <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. There is also a
tendency to ignorance, which forms the basis of the latency to craving. It is
the tendency to get attached to worldly concepts, without understanding them
for what they are. That tendency is a result of ignorance in the worldlings and
it is in itself a latency. In the <i>sutta</i> terminology the word <i>nissaya</i>
is often used to denote it. The cognate word <i>nissita</i> is also used
alongside. It means 'one who associates something', while <i>nissaya </i>means
'association'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, here it does
not have the same sense as the word has in its common usage. It goes deeper, to
convey the idea of 'leaning on' something. Leaning on is also a form of
association. Worldlings have a tendency to tenaciously grasp the concepts in
worldly usage, to cling to them dogmatically and lean on them. They believe
that the words they use have a reality of their own, that they are categorically
true in their own right. Their attitude towards concepts is tinctured by
craving, conceit and views. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We come across this word <i>nissita</i>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;To the one attached, there
is wavering. To the unattached one, there is no wavering. When there is no
wavering, there is calm. When there is calm, there is no inclination. When
there is no inclination, there is no coming and going. When there is no coming
and going, there is no death and birth. When there is no death and birth, there
is neither a 'here' nor a 'there' nor a 'between the two'. This itself is the
end of suffering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It looks as if the ending of
suffering is easy enough. On the face of it, the passage seems to convey this
much. To the one who leans on something, there is wavering or movement. He is
perturbable. Though the first sentence speaks about the one attached, the rest
of the passage is about the unattached one. That is to say, the one released.
So here we see the distinction between the two. The one attached is movable,
whereas the unattached one is not. When there is no wavering or perturbation,
there is calm. When there is calm, there is no inclination. The word <i>nati </i>usually
means 'bending'. So when there is calm, there is no bending or inclination.
When there is no bending or inclination, there is no coming and going. When
there is no coming and going, there is no passing away or reappearing. When
there is neither a passing away nor a reappearing, there is neither a 'here',
nor a 'there', nor any position in between. This itself is the end of
suffering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The <i>sutta </i>passage, at a
glance, appears like a jumble of words. It starts by saying something about the
one attached, <i>nissita</i>. It is limited to just one sentence: 'To one
attached, there is wavering.' But we can infer that, due to his wavering and
unsteadiness or restlessness, there is inclination, <i>nati</i>. The key word
of the passage is <i>nati</i>. Because of that inclination or bent, there is a
coming and going. Given the twin concept of coming and going, there is the
dichotomy between passing away and reappearing, <i>cuti/uppatti</i>. When these
two are there, the two concepts 'here' and 'there' also come in. And there is a
'between the two' as well. Wherever there are two ends, there is also a middle.
So it seems that in this particular context the word <i>nati</i>&nbsp;has a
special significance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The person who is attached is
quite unlike the released person. Because he is not released, he always has a
forward bent or inclination. In fact, this is the nature of craving. It bends
one forward. In some <i>suttas</i> dealing with the question of rebirth, such
as the <i>Kut<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>halas<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>l<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta</i>, craving itself is sometimes called the
grasping, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.<a
name="_ednref133"></a><a href="#_edn133" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[133]</span></span></a>
So it is due to this very inclination or bent that the two concepts of coming
and going, come in. Then, in accordance with them, the two concepts of passing
away and reappearing, fall into place. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The idea of a journey, when viewed
in the context of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
gives rise to the idea of passing away and reappearing. Going and coming are
similar to passing away and reappearing. So then, there is the implication of
two places, all this indicates an attachment. There is a certain dichotomy
about the terms here and there, and passing away and reappearing. Due to that
dichotomous nature of the concepts, which beings tenaciously hold on to, the
journeying in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>&nbsp;takes
place in accordance with craving. As we have mentioned above, an alternation or
transition occurs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As for the released person, about
whom the passage is specially concerned, his mind is free from all those conditions.
To the unattached, there is no wavering. Since he has no wavering or
unsteadiness, he has no inclination. As he has no inclination, there is no
coming and going for him. As there is no coming and going, he has no passing
away or reappearing. There being no passing away or reappearing, there is
neither a here, nor a there, nor any in between. That itself is the end of
suffering.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>version of the above passage has something significant about it. There the
entire <i>sutta </i>consists of these few sentences. But the introductory part
of it says that the Buddha was instructing, inciting and gladdening the monks
with a <i>Dhamma </i>talk connected with <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>:

points out that the worldlings mostly base themselves on a duality, the two
conflicting views of existence and non-existence, or 'is' and 'is not'. They
would either hold on to the dogmatic view of eternalism, or would cling to
nihilism. Now as to the right view of the noble disciple, it takes into account
the process of arising as well as the process of cessation, and thereby avoids
both extremes. This is the insight that illuminates the middle path. </span></p>

and grasping, that mental standpoint, namely the idea: 'This is my soul', he
knows that what arises is just suffering and what ceases is just suffering.

here to show that even the proclivity towards such a dogmatic involvement with
a soul or self, is not there in the noble disciple. But what, then, is his
point of view? What arises and ceases is nothing but suffering. There is no

depending on those very six, the world comes to grief. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though the commentators advance an
interpretation of this six, it does not seem to get the sanction of the <i>sutta
</i>as it is. According to them, the first line speaks of the six internal
sense bases, such as the eye, ear and nose.<a name="_ednref137"></a><a
href="#_edn137" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[137]</span></span></a> The world is said to arise in
these six internal sense bases. The second line is supposed to refer to the six
external sense bases. Again the third line is interpreted with reference to the
six internal sense bases, and the fourth line is said to refer to the six
external sense bases. In other words, the implication is that the world arises
in the six internal sense bases and associates with the six external sense
bases, and that it holds on to the six internal sense bases and comes to grief
in the six external sense bases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This interpretation seems to miss
the point. Even the grammar does not allow it, for if it is a case of
associating 'with' the external sense bases, the instrumental case would have
been used instead of the locative case, that is, <i>chahi </i>instead of <i>chasu</i>.
On the other hand, the locative <i>chasu</i> occurs in all the three lines in
question. This makes it implausible that the first two lines are referring to
two different groups of sixes. It is more plausible to conclude that the
reference is to the six sense bases of contact, <i>phass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i>,
which include both the internal and the external. In fact, at least two are
necessary for something to be dependently arisen. The world does not arise in
the six internal bases in isolation. It is precisely in this fact that the
depth of this <i>Dhamma</i> is to be seen.</span></p>

conditioned by becoming, birth; and conditioned by birth, decay-and-death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. Thus is the arising of this
entire mass of suffering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here the <i>sutta</i> starts with
the arising of contact and branches off towards the standard formula of <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>. Eye
consciousness arises dependent on, <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca</i>,
two things, namely eye and forms. And the concurrence of the three is contact.
This shows that two are necessary for a thing to be dependently arisen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So in fairness to the <i>sutta </i>version,
we have to conclude that the reference in all the four lines is to the bases of
contact, comprising both the internal and the external. That is to say, we
cannot discriminate between them and assert that the first line refers to one
set of six, and the second line refers to another. We are forced to such a
conclusion in fairness to the <i>sutta</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So from this verse also we can see
that according to the usage of the noble ones the world arises in the six sense
bases. This fact is quite often expressed by the phrase <i>ariyassa vinaye loko</i>,
the world in the noble one's discipline.<a name="_ednref139"></a><a
href="#_edn139" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[139]</span></span></a> According to this noble usage,
the world is always defined in terms of the six sense bases, as if the world
arises because of these six sense bases. This is a very deep idea. All other
teachings in this <i>Dhamma</i> will get obscured, if one fails to understand
this basic fact, namely how the concept of the world is defined in this mode of
noble usage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This noble usage reveals to us the
implications of the expression <i>udayatthag<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>min<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, the wisdom
that sees the rise and fall. About the noble disciple it is said that he is
endowed with the noble penetrative wisdom of seeing the rise and fall, <i>udayatthag<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>miniy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> paÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya samman<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gato ariy<span

name="_ednref140"></a><a href="#_edn140" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[140]</span></span></a>
The implication is that this noble wisdom has a penetrative quality about it.
This penetration is through the rigidly grasped almost impenetrable
encrustation of the two dogmatic views in the world, existence and
non-existence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, how does that penetration
come about? As already stated in the above quoted <i>Kacc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yanasutta</i>,
when one sees the arising aspect of the world, one finds it impossible to hold
the view that nothing exists in the world. His mind does not incline towards a
dogmatic involvement with that view. Similarly, when he sees the cessation of
the world through his own six sense bases, he sees no possibility to go to the
other extreme view in the world: 'Everything exists'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The most basic feature of this
principle of dependent arising, with its penetrative quality, is the breaking
down of the power of the above concepts. It is the very inability to grasp
these views dogmatically that is spoken of as the abandonment of the
personality view, <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>.
The ordinary worldling is under the impression that things exist in truth and
fact, but the noble disciple, because of his insight into the norm of arising
and cessation, understands the arising and ceasing nature of concepts and their
essencelessness or insubstantiality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Another aspect of the same thing, in
addition to what has already been said about <i>nissaya</i>, is the
understanding of the relatedness of this to that, <i>idappaccayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i> </i>implicit in the law of dependent arising.
In fact, we began our discussion by highlighting the significance of the term <i>idappaccayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.<a name="_ednref141"></a><a href="#_edn141"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[141]</span></span></a>
The basic principle involved, is itself often called <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca
samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>. &quot;This being, this comes to be,
with the arising of this, this arises. This not being, this does not come to
be. With the cessation of this, this ceases.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This insight penetrates through
those extreme views. It resolves the conflict between them. But how? By
removing the very premise on which it rested, and that is that there are two
things. Though logicians might come out with the law of identity and the like,
according to right view, the very bifurcation itself is the outcome of a wrong
view. That is to say, this is only a conjoined pair. In other words, it
resolves that conflict by accepting the worldly norm. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this is a point well worth
considering. In the case of the twelve links of the formula of dependent
arising, discovered by the Buddha, there is a relatedness of this to that, <i>idappaccayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. As for instance already illustrated above by the
two links birth and decay-and-death.<a name="_ednref142"></a><a href="#_edn142"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[142]</span></span></a>
When birth is there, decay-and-death come to be, with the arising of birth,
decay-and-death arise (and so on). The fact that this relatedness itself is the
eternal law, is clearly revealed by the following statement of the Buddha in
the <i>Nid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>&nbsp;of
the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>:

taken up to illustrate the principle governing their direct relation. Now let
us examine the meaning of the terms used to express that relation. <i>Tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>means 'such' or 'thus', and is suggestive of the
term <i>yath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>taÃ±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>adassana</i>, the knowledge and vision of things
as they are. The correlatives <i>yath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>and <i>tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>express between them the idea of faithfulness to
the nature of the world. So <i>tathat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> asserts
the validity of the law of dependent arising, as a norm in accordance with
nature. <i>Avitathat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i> </i>with its double
negative, reaffirms that validity to the degree of invariability. <i>AnaÃ±Ã±athat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i> </i>or not-otherwiseness, makes it
unchallengeable, as it were. It is a norm beyond contradiction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When a conjoined pair is accepted
as such, there is no conflict between the two. But since this idea can well
appear as some sort of a puzzle, we shall try to illustrate it with a simile.
Suppose two bulls, a black one and a white one, are bound together at the neck
and allowed to graze in the field as a pair. This is sometimes done to prevent
them from straying far afield. Now out of the pair, if the white bull pulls
towards the stream, while the black one is pulling towards the field, there is
a conflict. The conflict is not due to the bondage, at least not necessarily
due to the bondage. It is because the two are pulling in two directions.
Supposing the two bulls, somehow, accept the fact that they are in bondage and
behave amicably. When then the white bull pulls towards the stream, the black
one keeps him company with equanimity, though he is not in need of a drink. And
when the black bull is grazing, the white bull follows him along with
equanimity, though he is not inclined to eat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, in this case too, the
conflict is resolved by accepting the pair-wise combination as a conjoined
pair. That is how the Buddha solved this problem. But still the point of this
simile might not be clear enough. So let us come back to the two links, birth
and decay-and-death, which we so often dragged in for purposes of
clarification. So long as one does not accept the fact that these two links,
birth and decay-and-death, are a conjoined pair, one would see between them a
conflict. Why? Because one grasps birth as one end, and tries to remove the
other end, which one does not like, namely decay-and-death. One is trying to
separate birth from decay-and-death. But this happens to be a conjoined pair.
&quot;Conditioned by birth, monks, is decay-and-death.&quot; This is the word
of the Buddha. Birth and decay-and-death are related to each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The word <i>jar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
or decay, on analysis would make this clear. Usually by <i>jar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>
we mean old age. The word has connotations of senility and decrepitude, but the
word implies both growth and decay, as it sets in from the moment of one's
birth itself. Only, there is a possible distinction according to the standpoint
taken. This question of a standpoint or a point of view is very important at
this juncture. This is something one should assimilate with a meditative
attention. Let us bring up a simile to make this clear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, there could be
a person who makes his living by selling the leaves of a particular kind of
tree. Suppose another man sells the flowers of the same tree, to make his
living. And yet another sells the fruits, while a fourth sells the timber. If
we line them up and put to them the question, pointing to that tree: 'Is this
tree mature enough?', we might sometimes get different answers. Why? Each would
voice his own commercial point of view regarding the degree of maturity of the
tree. For instance, one who sells flowers would say that the tree is too old,
if the flowering stage of the tree is past. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, the concept of decay or
old age can change according to the standpoint taken up. From beginning to end,
it is a process of decay. But we create an artificial boundary between youth
and old age. This again shows that the two are a pair mutually conjoined.
Generally, the worldlings are engaged in an attempt to separate the two in this
conjoined pair. Before the Buddha came into the scene, all religious teachers
were trying to hold on to birth, while rejecting decay-and-death. But it was a
vain struggle. It is like the attempt of the miserly millionaire <i>Kosiya</i>
to eat rice-cakes alone, to cite another simile. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to that instructive
story, the millionaire <i>Kosiya</i>, an extreme miser, once developed a strong
desire to eat rice-cakes.<a name="_ednref144"></a><a href="#_edn144" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[144]</span></span></a>
As he did not wish to share them with anyone else, he climbed up to the topmost
storey of his mansion with his wife and got her to cook rice-cakes for him. To
teach him a lesson, Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, who excelled in psychic powers, went through
the air and appeared at the window as if he is on his alms round. <i>Kosiya</i>,
wishing to dismiss this intruder with a tiny rice-cake, asked his wife to put a
little bit of cake dough into the pan. She did so, but it became a big
rice-cake through the venerable <i>thera's</i> psychic power. Further attempts
to make tinier rice-cakes ended up in producing ever bigger and bigger ones. In
the end, <i>Kosiya </i>thought of dismissing the monk with just one cake, but
to his utter dismay, all the cakes got joined to each other to form a string of
cakes. The couple then started pulling this string of cakes in either direction
with all their might, to separate just one from it. But without success. At
last they decided to let go and give up, and offered the entire string of cakes
to the venerable <i>Thera. </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha's solution to the above
problem is a similar let go-ism and giving up. It is a case of giving up all assets,
<i>sabb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>padhipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>inissagga</i>.
You cannot separate these links from one another. Birth and decay-and-death are
intertwined. This is a conjoined pair. So the solution here, is to let go. All
those problems are due to taking up a standpoint. Therefore the kind of view
sanctioned in this case, is one that leads to detachment and dispassion, one
that goes against the tendency to grasp and hold on. It is by grasping and
holding on that one comes into conflict with <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now going by the story of the
millionaire <i>Kosiya</i>, one might think that the Buddha was defeated by <i>M<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. But the truth of the matter is that it is <i>M<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> who suffered defeat by this sort of giving up.
It is a very subtle point. <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra's</i> forte
lies in seizing and grabbing. He is always out to challenge. Sometimes he takes
delight in hiding himself to take one by surprise, to drive terror and cause
horripilation. So when <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> comes round to
grab, if we can find some means of foiling his attempt, or make it impossible
for him to grab, then <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> will have to
accept defeat. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us examine the Buddha's
solution to this question. There are in the world various means of preventing
others from grabbing something we possess. We can either hide our property in
an inaccessible place, or adopt security measures, or else we can come to terms
and sign a treaty with the enemy. But all these measures can sometimes fail.
However, there is one unfailing method, which in principle is bound to succeed.
A method that prevents all possibilities of grabbing. And that is - letting go,
giving up. When one lets go, there is nothing to grab. In a tug-of-war, when
someone is pulling at one end with all his might, if the other suddenly lets go
of its hold, one can well imagine the extent of the former's discomfiture, let
alone victory. It was such a discomfiture that fell to <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra's
</i>lot, when the Buddha applied this extraordinary solution. All this goes to
show the importance of such terms as <i>nissaya</i> and <i>idappaccayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> in understanding this <i>Dhamma</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have already taken up the word <i>nissaya</i>

find a set of conjoined or twin terms: </span></p>

development of knowledge and mindfulness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;&quot;And he abides

word used is <i>anissita</i>, independent, or not leaning towards anything. He
does not cling to anything in the world. The word <i>nissaya</i> says something
more than grasping. It means 'leaning on' or 'associating'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This particular thematic paragraph
in the <i>Satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>
is of paramount importance for insight meditation. Here, too, there is the
mention of internal, <i>ajjhatta</i>, and external, <i>bahiddh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
When one directs one's attention to one's own body and another's body
separately, one might sometimes take these two concepts, internal and external,
too seriously with a dogmatic attitude. One might think that there is actually
something that could be called one's own or another's. But then the mode of
attention next mentioned unifies the two, as internal-external, <i>ajjhattabahiddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, and presents them like the conjoined pair of
bulls. And what does it signify? These two are not to be viewed as two
extremes, they are related to each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us go a little deeper into
this interrelation. The farthest limit of the internal is the nearest limit of
the external. The farthest limit of the external is the nearest limit of the
internal. More strictly rendered, <i>ajjhatta </i>means inward and <i>bahiddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> means outward. So here we have the duality of an
inside and an outside. One might think that the word <i>ajjhattika </i>refers
to whatever is organic. Nowadays many people take in artificial parts into
their bodies. But once acquired, they too become internal. That is why, in this
context <i>ajjhattika</i> has a deeper significance than its usual rendering as
'one's own'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Whatever it may be, the farthest
limit of the <i>ajjhatta</i> remains the nearest limit of the <i>bahiddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. Whatever portion one demarcates as one's own,
just adjoining it and at its very gate is <i>bahiddh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
And from the point of view of <i>bahiddh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, its
farthest limit and at its periphery is <i>ajjhatta</i>. This is a conjoined
pair. These two are interrelated. So the implication is that these two are not
opposed to each other. That is why, by attending to them both together, as <i>ajjhattabahiddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, that dogmatic involvement with a view is
abandoned. Here we have an element of reconciliation, which prevents adherence
to a view. This is what fosters the attitude of <i>anissita</i>, unattached. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the two, <i>ajjhatta </i>and <i>bahiddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, are neighbours. Inside and outside as concepts
are neighbours to each other. It is the same as in the case of arising and
ceasing, mentioned above. This fact has already been revealed to some extent by
the <i>Kacc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yanagottasutta</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if we go for an illustration,
we have the word <i>udaya </i>at hand in <i>samudaya</i>. Quite often this word
is contrasted with <i>atthagama</i>, going down, in the expression <i>udayatthagamin<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, the wisdom
that sees the rise and fall. We can regard these two as words borrowed from
everyday life. <i>Udaya</i>&nbsp;means sunrise, and <i>atthagama</i> is sunset.
If we take this itself as an illustration, the farthest limit of the forenoon
is the nearest limit of the afternoon. The farthest limit of the afternoon is
the nearest limit of the forenoon. And here again we see a case of
neighbourhood. When one understands the neighbourly nature of the terms <i>udaya</i>
and <i>atthagama</i>, or <i>samudaya </i>and<i> vaya</i>, and regards them as
interrelated by the principle of <i>idappaccayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
one penetrates them both by that mode of contemplating the rise and fall of the
body together, <i>samudayavayadhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nupass<span

is a body' is established in him only to the extent necessary for pure
knowledge and further mindfulness&quot;, <i>'atthi k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yo'ti

that moment one does not take even the concept of body seriously. Even the
mindfulness that 'there is a body' is established in that meditator only for
the sake of,&nbsp;<i>yavadeva</i>, clarity of knowledge and accomplishment of
mindfulness. The last sentence brings out the net result of that way of
developing insight: &quot;He abides independent and does not cling to anything
in the world.&quot; </span></p>

None of the objects, taken up for the foundation of&nbsp; mindfulness, is to be
grasped tenaciously. Only their rise and fall is discerned. So it seems that,
what is found in the <i>Satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span

concepts serve only as a scaffolding for the systematic development of

many sects of Buddhism took up these concepts in a spirit of dogmatic

Buddha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We drew attention to a thematic
paragraph, occurring throughout the <i>Satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>, which outlines a method of using objects
and concepts for <i>satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>meditation without dogmatic involvement. This
leads the meditator to a particular kind of attitude, summed up by the
concluding phrase: &quot;He abides independent and does not cling to anything
in the world&quot;, <i>anissito ca viharati, na ca kiÃ±ci loke up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>diyati</i>.<a name="_ednref150"></a><a href="#_edn150"

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of clarification, we
brought in the simile of a scaffolding for a building, that here the concepts
only serve as a scaffolding for building up mindfulness and knowledge.<a
name="_ednref151"></a><a href="#_edn151" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[151]</span></span></a>
Talking about the scaffolding, we are reminded of two different attitudes,
namely, the attitude of leaning on to and dwelling in the scaffolding itself,
and the enlightened attitude of merely utilizing it for the purpose of erecting
a building. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For further explanation of this
technique, we may take up the two terms <i>par<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masana
</i>and <i>sammasana</i>. It might be better to distinguish the meanings of
these two terms also with the help of a simile. As for a simile, let us take up
the razor, which is such a useful requisite in our meditative life. There is a
certain special way in sharpening a razor. With the idea of sharpening the
razor, if one grabs it tightly and rubs it on the sharpening stone, it will
only become blunt. <i>Par<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masana</i>, grasping,
grabbing, is something like that. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What then is the alternative? A
more refined and softer approach is required as meant by the term <i>sammasana</i>.
There is a proper mode of doing it. One has to hold the razor in a relaxed way,
as if one is going to throw it away. One holds it lightly, ready to let go of
it at any time. But, of course, with mindfulness. The wrist, also, is not
rigid, but relaxed. Hand is supple at the joints and easy to swing. Then with
that readiness, one sharpens the razor, sliding it smoothly on the stone.
First: up, up, up, then: down, down, down, and then: up down, up down, up down.
The third combined movement ensures that those parts of the blade still
untouched by the stone will also get duly sharpened. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in the same manner that the
razor of insight wisdom has to be whetted on the sharpening stone of the <i>Satipa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>.
Inward, inward, inward - outward, outward, outward - inward outward, inward
outward. Or else: arising, arising, arising - ceasing, ceasing, ceasing -
arising ceasing, arising ceasing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is an illustration for the
method of reflection, or <i>sammasana</i>, introduced by the Buddha in the <i>Satipa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>.
Words and concepts have to be made use of, for attaining <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. But here the aim is only the up-building of
mindfulness and knowledge. Once their purpose is served, they can be dismantled
without being a bother to the mind. This is the significance of the concluding
phrase &quot;He abides independent and does not cling to anything in the

which the Buddha has touched upon this same point in particular. It is the <i>Samudayasutta</i>

Buddha has proclaimed the arising and the going down of the four foundations of
mindfulness. He begins by saying: &quot;Monks, I shall teach you the arising
and the going down of the four foundations of mindfulness&quot;. <i>Catunna<span

&quot;With the arising of attention is the arising of mind-objects, and with
the ceasing of attention is the going down of mind-objects&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This, too, is an important
discourse, well worth remembering, because here the Buddha is dealing with the
arising and cessation, or arising and going down, of the four objects used for
establishing mindfulness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we know, the concept of
nutriment in this <i>Dhamma</i> is much broader than the worldly concept of
food. It does not imply merely the ordinary food, for which the term used is <i>kabali<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, or material food. Taken in a deeper sense, it
includes the other three kinds of nutriment as well, namely <i>phassa</i>, or
contact, <i>manosaÃ±cetan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or volition, and <i>viÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>, or consciousness. These four together
account for the concept of body as such. Therefore, due to these four there
comes to be a body, and with their cessation the body ends. So also in the case
of feeling. We all know that the arising of feeling is due to contact. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The reference to name-and-form in
this context might not be clear enough at once, due to various definitions of
name-and-form, or <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>.
Here, the reason for the arising of the mind is said to be name-and-form. Mind
is said to arise because of name-and-form, and it is supposed to go down with
the cessation of name-and-form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The fact that the mind-objects
arise due to attention is noteworthy. All the mind-objects mentioned in the
fourth section of contemplation arise when there is attention. And they go down
when attention is not there. In other words, attending makes objects out of
them. This way, we are reminded that, apart from making use of these words and
concepts for the purpose of attaining <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
there is nothing worth holding on to or clinging to dogmatically. So if a
meditator works with this aim in mind, he will be assured of a state of mind
that is independent and clinging-free, <i>anissita</i>,<i> anup<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>One marvellous quality of the
Buddha's teaching emerges from this discussion. A mind-object is something that
the mind hangs on to as the connotations of the word <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i> (cp. <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lambhana</i>)
suggest. But because of the mode of insight wisdom outlined here, because of
the middle path approach, even the tendency to 'hang-on' is finally done away
with and the object is penetrated through. Despite the above connotations of
'hanging on' (<i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>),
the object is transcended. Transcendence in its highest sense is not a case of
surpassing, as is ordinarily understood. Instead of leaving behind, it
penetrates through. Here then, we have a transcendence that is in itself a
penetration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the terms <i>anissita</i> and <i>anup<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> seem to have a
significance of their own. More of it comes to light in quite a number of other
<i>suttas</i>. Particularly in the <i>Dvayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nupassan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta</i> of the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>

he has sloughed off. Sometimes we see a snake moving about with a remnant of

though he has attained release and realized <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
so long as he is living in the world, has to relate to the external objects in
the world somehow through his five senses, making use of them. Seeing it, some
might conclude that it is because of some residual clinging. But we have to
understand this in the light of the simile of the worn-out skin. In the case of

If there is even a dreg of ferment in a vessel, it is enough to cause
fermentation for any suitable raw material put into it. So also are the <i><span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sava</i> in this context is usually rendered as
'influxes'. We may understand them as certain intoxicating influences, which
create a world of sense-desires, a stupor that gives a notion of existence and
leads to ignorance. These influxes are often said to have the nature of
infiltrating into the mind. Sometimes a fourth type of influxes, <i>di<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The extinction of influxes becomes
a distinctive characteristic of an <i>arahant</i>, as it ensures complete
freedom. One could be said to have attained complete freedom only if one's mind
is free from these influxes. It is because these influxes are capable of
creating intoxication again and again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The immense importance of the
extinction of influxes, and how it accounts for the worthiness of an <i>arahant</i>,
is sometimes clearly brought out. The ultimate aim of the Buddha's teaching is
one that in other systems of thought is generally regarded as attainable only
after death. The Buddha, on the other hand, showed a way to its realization
here and now. </span></p>

&quot;How can one as a human being know or see or realize a supramundane state,
an extraordinary knowledge and vision befitting the noble ones?&quot; They
thought that such a realization is possible only after death. Immortality, in
other systems of thought, is always an after death experience. </span></p>

realizable things. What four? There are things, monks, that are realizable through
the body; there are things, monks, that are realizable through memory; there
are things, monks, that are realizable through the eye; there are things,
monks, that are realizable through wisdom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of explanation, the Buddha
says that the things realizable through the body are the eight deliverances,
the things realizable through memory are one's former habitations, the things
realizable through the eye are the death and rebirth of beings, and what is
realizable through wisdom, is the extinction of influxes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>One's former lives cannot be seen
with one's own eyes by running into the past. It is possible only by purifying
one's memory and directing it backwards. Similarly, the death and rebirth of
beings can be seen, as if with one's fleshly eye, by the divine eye, by those
who have developed it. So also the fact of extirpating all influxes is to be
realized by wisdom, and not by any other means. The fact that the influxes of
sensuality, existence, ignorance, and views, will not flow in again, can be
verified only by wisdom. That is why special mention is made of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> as something realizable.<a name="_ednref172"></a><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Because <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
is said to be something realizable, some are of the opinion that nothing should
be predicated about it. What is the reason for this special emphasis on its
realizability? It is to bring into sharp relief the point of divergence, since
the Buddha taught a way of realizing here and now something that in other
religions was considered impossible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What was it that they regarded
impossible to be realized? The cessation of existence, or <i>bhavanirodha</i>.
How can one be certain here and now that this existence has ceased? This might
sometimes appear as a big puzzle. But all the same, the <i>arahant</i>
experiences the cessation of existence as a realization. That is why he even
gives expression to it as: <i>Bhavanirodho Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,<a name="_ednref173"></a><a href="#_edn173"

&quot;cessation of existence is <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&quot;.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It comes about by this extinction
of influxes. The very existence of 'existence' is especially due to the flowing
in of influxes of existence. What is called 'existence' is not the apparent
process of existing visible to others. It is something that pertains to one's
own mental continuum. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, when it is said that
some person is in the world of sense desires, one might sometimes imagine it as
living surrounded by objects of sense pleasure. But that is not always the
case. It is the existence in a world of sense desires, built up by sensuous thoughts.
It is the same with the realms of form and formless realms. Even those realms
can be experienced and attained while living in this world itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, it is possible for one
to realize the complete cessation of this existence while living in this very
world. It is accomplished by winning to the realization that the influxes of
sense desires, existence, and ignorance, no longer influence one's mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So all this goes to show the high
degree of importance attached to the word <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sava</i>.
The <i>Samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hisutta
</i>of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> seems to pose a
problem regarding the significance of this term. At one place in the <i>sutta</i>&nbsp;it
is said that the arising of ignorance is due to the arising of influxes and
that the cessation of ignorance is due to the cessation of influxes: <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>savasamuday<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> avijj<span

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If the <i>sutta</i> says only this
much, it will not be such a problem, because it appears as a puzzle to many
nowadays, why ignorance is placed first. Various reasons are adduced and
arguments put forward as to why it is stated first out of the twelve factors.
The fact that there is still something to precede it could therefore be some
consolation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But then, a little way off, in the
selfsame <i>sutta</i>, we read:<i> Avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>samuday<span

&quot;with the arising of ignorance is the arising of influxes, with the
cessation of ignorance is the cessation of influxes&quot;. Apparently this contradicts
the previous statement. The preacher of this discourse, Venerable <i>S<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta</i>, is not one who contradicts himself. So
most probably there is some deep reason behind this. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Another problem crops up, since
ignorance is also counted among the different kinds of influxes. This makes our
puzzle all the more deep. But this state of affairs could best be understood
with the help of an illustration. It is in order to explain a certain
fascinating behaviour of the mind that even <i>arahants</i> of great wisdom had
to make seemingly contradictory statements. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have to draw in at this
juncture a very important discourse in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta

in the section on the aggregates, <i>Khandhasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>,

picture called a movie (<i>cara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>)?' 'Yes,
Lord.' 'Monks, even that picture called a movie is something thought out by the
mind. But this mind, monks, is more picturesque than that picture called a
movie. Therefore, monks, you should reflect moment to moment on your own mind
with the thought: For a long time has this mind been defiled by lust, hate, and
delusion. By the defilement of the mind, monks, are beings defiled. By the
purification of the mind, are beings purified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Monks, I do not see any other
class of beings as picturesque as beings in the animal realm. But those beings
in the animal realm, monks, are also thought out by the mind. And the mind,
monks, is far more picturesque than those beings in the animal realm.
Therefore, monks, should a monk reflect moment to moment on one's own mind with
the thought: For a long time has this mind been defiled by lust, hate, and
delusion. By the defilement of the mind, monks, are beings defiled. By the
purification of the mind, are beings purified.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here the Buddha gives two
illustrations to show how marvellous this mind is. First he asks the monks
whether they have seen a picture called <i>cara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>.
Though the word may be rendered by movie, it is not a motion picture of the
sort we have today. According to the commentary, it is some kind of variegated
painting done on a mobile canvas-chamber, illustrative of the results of good
and evil karma.<a name="_ednref177"></a><a href="#_edn177" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[177]</span></span></a>
Whatever it may be, it seems to have been something marvellous. But far more
marvellous, according to the Buddha, is this mind. The reason given is that
even such a picture is something thought out by the mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then, by way of an advice to the
monks, says the Buddha: 'Therefore, monks, you should reflect on your mind moment
to moment with the thought: For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust,
hate, and delusion.' The moral drawn is that beings are defiled by the
defilement of their minds and that they are purified by the purification of
their minds. This is the illustration by the simile of the picture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And then the Buddha goes on to
make another significant declaration: 'Monks, I do not see any other class of
beings as picturesque as beings in the animal realm.' But since those beings
also are thought out by the mind, he declares that the mind is far more
picturesque than them. Based on this conclusion, he repeats the same advice as
before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At first sight the <i>sutta</i>,&nbsp;when
it refers to a picture, seems to be speaking about the man who drew it. But
there is something deeper than that. When the Buddha says that the picture
called <i>cara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i> is also something thought
out by the mind, he is not simply stating the fact that the artist drew it
after thinking it out with his mind. The reference is rather to the mind of the
one who sees it. He, who sees it, regards it as something marvellous. He
creates a picture out of it. He imagines something picturesque in it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact, the allusion is not to
the artist's mind, but to the spectator's mind. It is on account of the three defilements
lust, hate, and delusion, nurtured in his mind for a long time, that he is able
to appreciate and enjoy that picture. Such is the nature of those influxes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That is why the Buddha declared
that this mind is far more picturesque than the picture in question. So if one
turns back to look at one's own mind, in accordance with the Buddha's advice,
it will be a wonderful experience, like watching a movie. Why? Because
reflection reveals the most marvellous sight in the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But usually one does not like to
reflect, because one has to turn back to do so. One is generally inclined to
look at the thing in front. However, the Buddha advises us to turn back and
look at one's own mind every moment. Why? Because the mind is more marvellous
than that picture called <i>cara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>, or movie.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the same declaration that he
makes with reference to the beings in the animal realm. When one comes to think
about it, there is even less room for doubt here, than in the case of the
picture. First of all, the Buddha declares that there is no class of beings
more picturesque than those in the animal realm. But he follows it up with the
statement that even those beings are thought out by the mind, to draw the
conclusion that as such the mind is more picturesque than those beings of the
animal realm. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us try to sort out the point
of this declaration. Generally, we may agree that beings in the animal realm
are the most picturesque. We sometimes say that the butterfly is beautiful. But
we might hesitate to call a blue fly beautiful. The tiger is fierce, but the
cat is not. Here one's personal attitude accounts much for the concepts of
beauty, ugliness, fierceness, and innocence of animals. It is because of the
defiling influence of influxes, such as ignorance, that the world around us
appears so picturesque. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Based on this particular <i>sutta</i>,
with its reference to the <i>cara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i> picture
as a prototype, we may take a peep at the modern day's movie film, by way of an
analogy. It might facilitate the understanding of the teachings on <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i> and <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> in a way that is closer to our everyday life.
The principles governing the film and the drama are part and parcel of the life
outside cinema and the theatre. But since it is generally difficult to grasp
them in the context of the life outside, we shall now try to elucidate them
with reference to the cinema and the theatre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Usually a film or a drama is shown
at night. The reason for it is the presence of darkness. This darkness helps to
bring out the darkness of ignorance that dwells in the minds of beings. So the
film as well as the drama is presented to the public within a framework of
darkness. If a film is shown at day time, as a matinee show, it necessitates
closed windows and dark curtains. In this way, films and dramas are shown
within a curtained enclosure. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is another strange thing
about these films and dramas. One goes to the cinema or the theatre saying:
&quot;I am going to see a film show, I am going to see a drama&quot;. And one
returns saying: &quot;I have seen a film show, I have seen a drama&quot;. But
while the film show or the drama is going on, one forgets that one is seeing a
show or a drama. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such a strange spell of delusion
takes over. This is due to the intoxicating influence of influxes. If one wishes
to enjoy a film show or a drama, one should be prepared to get intoxicated by
it. Otherwise it will cease to be a film show or a drama for him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What do the film producers and
dramatists do? They prepare the background for eliciting the influxes of ignorance,
latent in the minds of the audience. That is why such shows and performances
are held at night, or else dark curtains are employed. They have an intricate
job to do. Within the framework of darkness, they have to create a delusion in
the minds of their audience, so as to enact some story in a realistic manner. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To be successful, a film or a
drama has to be given a touch of realism. Though fictitious, it should be
apparently real for the audience. There is an element of deception involved, a
hoodwink. For this touch of realism, quite a lot of make-up on the part of
actors and actresses is necessary. As a matter of fact, in the ancient Indian
society, one of the primary senses of the word <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> was the make-up done by actors and actresses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in the present context, <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> can include not
only this make-up in personal appearance, but also the acting itself, the
delineation of character, stage-craft etc.. In this way, the film producers and
dramatists create a suitable environment, making use of the darkness and the
make-up contrivances. These are the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, or the 'preparations'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, to be more precise, it is
the audience that make preparations, in the last analysis. Here too, as before,
we are compelled to make a statement that might appear strange: So far not a
single cinema has held a film show and not a single theatre has staged a drama.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And yet, those who had gone to the
cinema and the theatre had seen film shows and dramas. Now, how can that be?
Usually, we think that it is the film producer who produced the film and that
it is the dramatist who made the drama. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But if we are to understand the
deeper implications of what the Buddha declared, with reference to the picture <i>cara<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>, a film show or drama is produced, in the last
analysis, by the spectator himself. When he goes to the cinema and the theatre,
he takes with him the spices needed to concoct a film or a drama, and that is:
the influxes, or <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>savas</i>. Whatever technical
defects and shortcomings there are in them, he makes good with his influxes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we know, in a drama there is a
certain interval between two scenes. But the average audience is able to
appreciate even such a drama, because they are influenced by the influxes of
sense desire, existence, and ignorance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With the progress in science and
technology, scenes are made to fall on the screen with extreme rapidity. All
the same, the element of delusion is still there. The purpose is to create the
necessary environment for arousing delusion in the minds of the audience. Whatever
preparations others may make, if the audience does not respond with their own
preparations along the same lines, the drama will not be a success. But in
general, the worldlings have a tendency to prepare and concoct, so they would
make up for any short comings in the film or the drama with their own
preparations and enjoy them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, let us think of
an occasion when a film show is going on within the framework of darkness. In
the case of a matinee show, doors and windows will have to be closed. Supposing
the doors are suddenly flung open, while a vivid technicolour scene is flashing
on the screen, what happens then? The spectators will find themselves suddenly
thrown out of the cinema world they had created for themselves. Why? Because the
scene in technicolour has now lost its colour. It has faded away. The result is
dejection, disenchantment. The film show loses its significance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That film show owed its existence
to the dark framework of ignorance and the force of preparations. But now that
the framework has broken down, such a vast change has come over, resulting in a
disenchantment. Now the word <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i> has a
nuance suggestive of colour, so <i>vir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>,
dispassion, can also literally mean a fading away or a decolouration. Here we
have a possible instance of <i>nibbid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> vir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>, disenchantment, dispassion, at least in a
limited sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A door suddenly flung open can
push aside the delusion, at least temporarily. Let us consider the implications
of this little event. The film show, in this case, ceases to be a film show
because of a flash of light coming from outside. Now, what would have happened
if this flash of light had come from within - from within one's mind? Then also
something similar would have happened. If the light of wisdom dawns on one's mind
while watching a film show or a drama, one would even wonder whether it is
actually a film or a drama, while others are enjoying it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Speaking about the film show, we
mentioned above that the spectator has entered into a world of his own
creation. If we are to analyse this situation according to the law of dependent
origination, we may add that in fact he has a consciousness and a name-and-form
in line with the events of the story, based on the preparations in the midst of
the darkness of ignorance. With all his experiences in seeing the film show, he
is building up his five aggregates. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Therefore, when the light of
wisdom comes and dispels the darkness of ignorance, a similar event can occur.
One will come out of that plane of existence. One will step out of the world of
sense desires, at least temporarily. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, with regard to the <i>arahants</i>,<i>
</i>too, the same trend of events holds good. When their ignorance ceases,
leaving no residue, <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya tveva asesavir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ganirodh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, exhausting
the influxes as well, preparations also cease. Why? Because the preparations
owe their existence to ignorance. They have the ability to prepare so long as
there is ignorance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'> generally means preparations. It is the make-up
and the make-believe which accounted for the delusion. The darkness of
ignorance provided the setting for it. If somehow or other, the light of wisdom
enters the scene, those preparations, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, became no-preparations, <i>visa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, and the prepared,
<i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>, becomes a non-prepared, <i>asa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So what was true with regard to
the film show, is also true, in a deeper sense, with regard to the events
leading up to the attainment of <i>arahant</i>-hood. With the dawn of that
light of wisdom, the preparations, or <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, lose their significance and become <i>visa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though for the world outside they
appear as preparations, for the <i>arahant</i> they are not preparations,
because they do not prepare a <i>bhava</i>, or existence, for him. They are
made ineffective. Similarly, the prepared or the made-up, when it is understood
as something prepared or made-up, becomes an un-prepared or an un-made. There
is a subtle principle of un-doing involved in this. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It says that the Buddha, the
kinsman of the sun, has compared form to a mass of foam, feeling to a water
bubble, perception to a mirage, preparations to a banana trunk, and
consciousness to a magic show. These five similes bring out the
insubstantiality of the five grasping groups. Their simulating and deceptive
nature is indicated by the similes. Not only the magic show, but even the other
similes, like the mass of foam, are suggestive of simulation, in giving a false
notion of compactness. They all convey the idea of insubstantiality and
deceptiveness. Consciousness in particular, is described in that context as a
conjurer's trick. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the course of our discussion we
happened to touch upon the significance of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, or preparations. As far as their relevance to
films and dramas is concerned, they impart an appearance of reality to 'parts'
and 'acts' which make up a film or a drama. Realism, in the context of art and
drama, amounts to an apparent reality. It connotes the skill in deceiving the
audience. It is, in fact, only a show of reality. The successful drama is one
that effectively hoodwinks an audience. So realism, in that context, means
appearing as real. It therefore has a nuance of deception. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now what supports this deceptive
and delusive quality of preparations is ignorance. All this 'acting' that is
going on in the world is kept up by ignorance, which provides the background
for it. Just as, in a drama, such preparations as change of dress, make-up
contrivances, character portrayal, and stage-craft, create an atmosphere of
delusion, so also are the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, or preparations, instrumental in building up
these five grasping groups. So all this goes to show that the term <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> has the sense
of preparing or producing. The realistic appearance of a film or a drama is
capable of creating a delusion in an audience. Similarly, the apparent reality
of the animate and inanimate objects in the world, creates delusion in the
worldlings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now to hark back to two lines of a
verse we had quoted earlier, <i>mohasambandhano loko, bhabbar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>po

&quot;the world appears as real to one who is fettered to delusion&quot;. This means
that the world has an apparent reality, that it merely gives the impression of
something real to one who is deluded. It is clear, therefore, that <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>&nbsp;are
responsible for some sort of preparation or concoction. What serves as the
background for it, is the darkness of ignorance. This preparation, this

Intention and imagination play their part in this matter of preparation. So in
the last analysis, it is something constructed by imagination. All of these

These terms have to do with merit and demerit. They are cited in connection
with <i>kamma</i>, implying that beings accumulate <i>kamma </i>by means of
body, word and mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What supports this heaping up of
preparations is ignorance. Ignorance provides the background, as in the case of
the drama and the movie. This relationship between ignorance and preparations
is clearly brought out in the <i>Cetan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta</i>
of the <i>SaÃ±cetaniyavagga</i> of the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara

href="#_edn199" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[199]</span></span></a> According to that <i>sutta</i>,
the world attributes an activity to something by regarding it as a unit - by
perceiving it as a compact unit. In other words, it is the way of the world to
superimpose the concept of a unit or self-agency to wherever there appears to
be some sort of activity. As we mentioned in connection with the simile of the
whirlpool, viewed from a distance, the whirlpool appears as a centre or a base.<a
name="_ednref200"></a><a href="#_edn200" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[200]</span></span></a>
In the same way, wherever there appears to be some form of activity, we tend to
bring in the concept of a unit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now it is this very ignorance,
this 'ignoring', that becomes the seed-bed for preparations. The basic
presumption of this ignorance is that preparations must originate from a
unitary centre. And the Buddha also points out, in the <i>Cetan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta </i>of the <i>SaÃ±cetaniyavagga</i>, that the root
cause of bodily, verbal, and mental preparations, is ignorance.<a

there, due to bodily intention, there arises inward pleasure and pain. Monks,
when speech is there, due to verbal intention, there arises inward pleasure and

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us take this as the first
section and try to get at its meaning. Given the concept of a body, due to
intentions based on that concept of a body, there arises inwardly pleasure and
pain. That is, when one imagines that there is a body, due to thoughts which
take body as their object, one experiences pleasure and pain. What is called
'the body', is a huge mass of activity, something like a big workshop or a
factory. But because of ignorance, if one takes it as one thing, that is as a
unit, then there is room for bodily intention to come in. One can objectify the
body and arouse thoughts of the body. Thereby one experiences pleasure and
pain. This is the implication of the above statement. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, in the case of speech,
it may be said that language is a conglomeration of letters and words. But when
speech is taken as a real unit, one can form intentions about speech and
inwardly experience pleasure and pain. So also in the case of the mind. It is
not an entity by itself, like a soul, as postulated by other religions. It is
again only a heap of thoughts. But if one grants that there is a mind, due to
that very presumption, one experiences inwardly pleasure and pain with mind as
its object. The concluding phrase of that paragraph is particularly
significant. It says that all this is conditioned by ignorance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Monks, in all these cases,
ignorance hangs on. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of
ignorance, that body is not there, owing to which there can arise for him
inward pleasure or pain, that speech is not there, owing to which there can arise
for him inward pleasure and pain, that mind is not there, owing to which there
can arise for him inward pleasure and pain. That field is not there, that site
is not there, that base is not there, that reason is not there, owing to which
there can arise for him inward pleasure or pain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Since all the instances mentioned
earlier are accompanied by ignorance, the utter fading away and cessation of
that very ignorance prevents, as it were, the crystallization of that body,
speech, and mind, due to which inward pleasure and pain can arise. In other
words, it removes the field, the ground, the base and the provenance for the
arising of inward pleasure and pain. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This shows that, once the
existence of a body is granted, with that concept of a body as its object,
bodily preparations come to be built up. Or, in other words, given the concept
of a body, and due to bodily intention, that is by treating it as a real unit,
one experiences inwardly pleasure and pain because of thoughts concerning the
body. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So also in regard to speech and
mind. It is emphatically stated that all this occurs because of ignorance. What
confers on them all the status of a unit, through the perception of the
compact, is this very ignorance. As for the second paragraph, what it says is
simply that those bodily preparations and the like can be made by oneself as
well as by others, and that too either being aware or unaware. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

ignorance. Therefore, at whatever point of time this ignorance ceases
completely in someone, then for him there is no consciousness of a body, though
from an outside point of view he appears to have a body. He may use words, he
may speak, but for him there is nothing substantial in linguistic usage. He
seems to be making use of a mind, mind-objects also come up, but he does not
regard it as a unit. Therefore, inwardly, no pleasures and pains come up. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

comes the cessation of preparations. Thereby all pleasures and pains cease.
This, in other words, is the state of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
It appears, then, that this discourse gives us a clue to the state of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. It says something about bodily, verbal, and
mental preparations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If we try to understand its
message in relation to the analogy of the film show and the drama, mentioned
earlier, we may offer the following explanation: Now in the case of a film show
or a drama, the preparations remain as preparations so long as there is that
darkness of ignorance. The realism or the realistic appearance of the acting of
actors and actresses, or the roles and guises they assume in dress and speech,
depends on the veil of ignorance that conceals their true nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, here too, the
implication is that it is ignorance which invests these preparations with the
realistic appearance. If at any point of time that ignorance happens to cease,
then there will be no pleasure or displeasure for the audience, however much
make-up and pretension there is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is such a situation of
non-enjoyment that we happened to mention in the previous sermon with reference
to the witnessing of a hill-top festival by <i>Upatissa </i>and <i>Kolita</i>.<a

They had a flash of insight due to the light of wisdom that came from within,
not due to any illumination from outside. Because of it, those preparations
ceased to be preparations. From this we can understand that the term <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> becomes
meaningful only against the background of ignorance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To move a step further, it is
against the background of both ignorance and preparations that all the
subsequent links in the formula become meaningful. As far as the interrelation
between consciousness and name-and-form is concerned, all what we have said
above regarding the reflection of name-and-form on consciousness,<a
name="_ednref203"></a><a href="#_edn203" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[203]</span></span></a>
becomes meaningful only so long as the reality of preparations is granted, that
is, only so far as their deceptive nature is maintained. But that deceptive
nature owes its existence to ignorance. This way we can unravel one aspect of
the essential significance of the term <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

first having thought and pondered one breaks into speech, that is why thinking

lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>is defined as
thinking and pondering, not in terms of karma such as abusive speech and the
like. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then, as the third, <i>cittasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ro </i>is given the
following definition: <i>SaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ca vedan<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ro</i>.
&quot;Perception and feeling are mental, they are bound up with the mind, that
is why perception and feeling are a mind-preparation.&quot; Perception and
feeling are called a mind-preparation because they are mental and have to do
with the mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to this definition it
appears, then, that what the Buddha had indicated as the second link of the
formula of dependent arising, is in-breathing and out-breathing, thinking and
pondering, and perception and feeling. The mode of interpretation, we have
adopted, shows us that the word <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, in the context of a drama, for instance, can
mean preparations or some sort of preliminary arrangement or fashioning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this sense of preparation is
applicable to in-breaths and out-breaths too. As we know, in all our bodily
activities, particularly in lifting some weight and the like, or when exerting
ourselves, we sometimes take a deep breath, almost impulsively. That is to say,
the most basic activity of this body is in-breathing and out-breathing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Moreover, in the definition of <i>vac<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ro</i>
it is clearly stated that one speaks out having first thought out and pondered.
This is a clear instance of the role of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> as a 'preparation' or a preliminary activity.
Now the word 'rehearsal' is in common use in the society. Sometimes, the day
before a drama is staged for the society, a sort of trial performance is held.
Similarly, before breaking out into speech, one thinks and ponders. That is why
sometimes we find words issuing out before we can be aware of it. Thinking and
pondering is called <i>vac<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ro</i>, because they 'prepare' speech. The sense of
'preparation' is therefore quite apt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then there is perception and
feeling, for which the term <i>cittasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ro</i> is used here, instead of <i>manosa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. The reason for
it is that what we reckon as <i>manosa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> is actually the more prominent level represented
by intentions and the like. The background for those intentions, the subliminal
preparatory stage, is to be found in perception and feeling. It is perception
and feeling that give the impetus for the arising of the more prominent stage
of intention. They provide the necessary mental condition for doing evil or
good deeds. This way, we can get at the subtle nuances of the term <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. Just as in the
case of an iceberg floating in the ocean, the greater part is submerged and
only a fraction of it shows above the surface, so also the deeper nuances of
this term are rather imperceptible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Beneath our heap of body actions,
verbal actions, and mental acts of willing or intentions lies a huge mountain
of activities. Breathing in and breathing out is the most basic activity in
one's life. It is, in fact, the criterion for judging whether one is alive or
dead. For instance, when someone falls in a swoon, we examine him to see
whether he is still breathing, whether this basic activity is still there in
him. Also, in such a case, we try to see whether he can speak and feel, whether
perception and feeling are still there in him. So in this </span></p>

clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>way
we can understand how these basic forms of activity decide the criterion for
judging whether life is present or extinct in a person. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That activity is something
internal. But even at that level, defilements lie dormant, because ignorance is
hiding there too. In fact, that is precisely why they are reckoned as <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. Usually, one
thinks in terms of 'I' and 'mine', as: &quot;I breathe&quot;, &quot;I
speak&quot;, &quot;I see&quot;, and &quot;I feel&quot;. So, like the submerged
portion of an iceberg, these subtler layers of preparations also have ignorance
hidden within them. That is why the attempt of pre-Buddhistic ascetics to solve
this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
riddle by tranquillity alone met with failure. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Pre-Buddhistic ascetics, and even <i><span

thought that they can get out of this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> by tranquillizing the bodily activities, the
verbal activities, and the mental activities. But they did not understand that
all these are <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>,
or preparations, therefore they were confronted with a certain dilemma. They
went on calming down the bodily activities to subtler and subtler levels. They
calmed down the in-breaths and out-breaths, they managed to suppress thinking
and pondering by concentration exercises, but without proper understanding. It
was only a temporary calming down. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, once they reached the
level of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, they had to face a certain
problem. In fact, the very designation of that level of attainment betrays the
dilemma they were in. It means that one is at a loss to say definitely whether
there is some perception or not. The <i>PaÃ±cattayasutta</i> clearly reveals this
fact. It gives expression to the problem facing those ascetics in the following
significant statement: </span></p>

&quot;Perception is a disease, perception is a boil, perception is a dart, but
not to have perception is to be deluded, this is peaceful, this is excellent,
that is, neither-perception-nor-non-perception.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>They understood to some extent
that this perception is a disease, a trouble, a tumour, or a wound, or else a
thorn, they wanted to be free from perception. But then, on the other hand,
they feared that to be totally free from perception is to be in a deluded
state. Therefore they concluded: 'This is peaceful, this is excellent, that is
neither-perception-nor-non-perception', and came to a halt there. That is why
the Buddha rejected even <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>l<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra

of all preparations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the kind of tranquillity
meditation followed by the pre-Buddhistic ascetics, through various higher
knowledges and meditative attainments, could never bring about a stilling of
all preparations. Why? Because the ignorance underlying those preparations were
not discernible to their level of wisdom. In the least, they could not even
recognize their <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra
</i>nature. They thought that these are only states of a soul. Therefore, like
the present day Hindu Yogins following the philosophy of the <i>Upani<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#347;</span>ads</i>, they thought that breathing is just one layer
of the self, it is one of the outer rinds of the soul. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact, the 'kernel' of self was
supposed to have around it the four rinds, <i>annamaya, pr<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>amaya,
sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>jÃ±amaya, </i>and <i>vijÃ±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>amaya</i>.
That is to say, made out of food, breath, perception, and consciousness,
respectively. Apart from treating them as states of a self, they were not able
to understand that all these activities are <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i> and that ignorance is the spring-board for
them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In view of the fact that <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is called the stilling of all preparations, <i>sabbasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rasamatha</i>, one
might sometimes conclude that the attainment of the cessation of perceptions
and feeling, <i>saÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vedayitanirodha</i>, is in
itself <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. But it is on rising from that
attainment, which is like a deep freeze, that one makes contact with the three
deliverances, the signless, <i>animitta</i>, the desireless, <i>appa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ihita</i>, and the void, <i>suÃ±Ã±ata</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the Buddhist outlook,
it is wisdom that decides the issue, and not tranquillity. Therefore, in the
last analysis, preparations cease to be preparations when the tendency to grasp
the sign in the preparations is got rid of and signlessness is experienced. The
'sign' stands for the notion of permanence and it accounts for the deceptive
nature of preparations, as in the case of an actor's make-up and stage-craft.
It is the sign of permanence that leads to a desire for something, to
expectations and aspirations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So that sign has to leave together
with the desire, for the Desireless Deliverance to come about. Then one has to
see all this as essenceless and void. It is just because of desire that we
regard something as 'essence-tial'. We ask for the purpose of something, when
we have desire. Now it is through this unique vision of the Signless, the
Desireless, and the Void, that the Buddha arrived at the state of stilling of
all preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We resort to the simile of the
film show and the drama not out of disregard for the precept concerning
abstention from such diversions, but because the Buddha has called dancing a
form of mad behaviour. <i>Ummattakam ida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,
bhikkhave, ariyassa vinaye yadida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> nacca<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[207]</span></span></a>
&quot;This, monks, is a form of madness according to the noble one's
discipline, namely dancing.&quot; Now what is the nature of a madman? He is
jumpy. From the standpoint of <i>Dhamma</i>, dancing is a form of jumpiness. In
fact, all preparations are that. It shows a nervous stress as well as a nervous
release. It is an endless series of winding and unwinding. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What makes this problem of <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>such a knotty
one to solve? We go on heaping up karmic actions, but when the time comes to
experience their consequences, we do not regard them as mere results of karma,
but superimpose an 'I' on that experience. So we act with the notion of an 'I'
and react to the consequences again with the notion of an 'I'. Because of that
egoistic reaction, we heap up fresh karma. So here is a case of stress and
release, of winding and rewinding. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is like a tangled skein.
Sometimes, when an unskilled person tries to disentangle a tangled skein while
disentangling one end, the other end gets entangled. So it is, in the case of
this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>ball
of thread. While doing a karma, one is conscious of it as &quot;I am doing
it&quot;. And when it is the turn to suffer for it, one does not think it as a
result of that karma. Consequently one accumulates fresh karma through various
attachments and conflicts arising out of it. Here too we see some sort of a
drama. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if one can get the opportunity
to see either a rehearsal or the back-stage preparations for a drama, which
however is not usually accessible to the public, one would be able to see
through the drama. If one can steal a peep into the back-stage make-up
contrivances of actors and actresses, one would see how ugly persons can become
comely and the wretched can appear regal. One would then see what a 'poor show'
it is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the same way there is something
dramatic in these basic preparations, namely - in-breathing and out-breathing,
thinking and pondering, perception and feeling. If one sees these back-stage
preparations with wisdom, one would be disenchanted. What tranquillity
meditation does, is to temporarily calm them down and derive some sort of
happiness. That too is necessary from the point of view of concentration, to do
away with restlessness and the like, but it does not dispel ignorance. That is
why, in insight meditation, one tries to understand preparations for what they
are by dispelling ignorance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The more one sees preparations as preparations,
ignorance is dispelled, and the more one dispels ignorance, the preparations
lose their significance as preparations. Then one sees the nature of
preparations with wisdom as signless, desireless, and void. So much so that, in
effect, preparations cease to be preparations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is something of a marvel. If
we now hark back to the two words 'winding' and 'rewinding', the entire world,
or <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>existence
in its entirety, is a process of winding and rewinding. Where the winding ends
and the rewinding begins is a matter beyond our comprehension. But one thing is
clear - all these comes to cease when craving and grasping are abandoned. It is
towards such an objective that our minds turn by recognizing preparations for
what they are, as a result of a deeper analysis of their nature. </span></p>

is somewhat similar to the relation a drama has to its back-stage preparations.
It seems, then, that from the standpoint of <i>Dhamma </i>the entire <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> is a product of
specifically prepared intentions, even like the drama with its back-stage
preparations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us return to the simile of the
cinema again. The average man, when he says that he has seen a film show, what
he has actually seen is just one scene flashing on the screen at a time. As we
happened to mention in an earlier sermon, people go to the cinema and to the
theatre saying: &quot;We are going to see a film show, we are going to see a
drama&quot;.<a name="_ednref208"></a><a href="#_edn208" title=""><span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What really has happened? How did
they see a film show? Just as much as one creates a name-and-form on one's
screen of consciousness with the help of preparations, the film-goer has
created a story by putting together the series of scenes falling on the screen.

film-goer steps in late, half way through, he would not be able to gather that
portion of the film already gone. It is gone, gone , gone forever. Those
preparations are irrevocably past. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A film show actually becomes a
film show thanks to that glue used by the audience - the glue of craving. The

<i>Ponobhavika </i>as a characteristic of craving means, in its broader sense,
that it leads to re-becoming. One might think that by 're-becoming' only the
connecting up of one existence in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span

instance, connects up the first scene with the second, in order to understand
the latter. And that is how one 'sees' a film show and comes back and says:
&quot;I have seen a film show&quot;. All the scenes do not fall on the screen
at once, but a connecting-up goes on. That is the idea behind the term <i>ponobhavika</i>.
In this connecting up of one scene with another there is an element of
re-becoming or re-generation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then there is the term <i>nandir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gasahagata</i>. This is the other additive which should
be there for one to enjoy the film show. It means the nature of delighting and
getting attached. Craving in particular is like a glue. In fact, a synonym for
it is <i>lepa</i>, which means a 'glue'.<a name="_ednref210"></a><a
href="#_edn210" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[210]</span></span></a> Another synonym is <i>visattika</i>,
an 'adhesive' or a 'sticky substance'.<a name="_ednref211"></a><a

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[211]</span></span></a> Even the word <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>, or attachment, already conveys this sense. So
craving, or desire, glues the scenes together. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then comes the term<i> tatratatr<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhinandi</i>, the nature of delighting, in particular
now here, now there. It is, in effect, the association of one scene with
another in order to make up a story out of it. That is why we made the
statement: 'So far not a single cinema has held a film show and not a single
theatre has staged a drama'.<a name="_ednref212"></a><a href="#_edn212" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[212]</span></span></a>
But all the same, those who went to the cinema and the theatre witnessed a show
and a drama. How? They produced them, or prepared them, with their 'sticky'
defilements on their own.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is as if the Buddha is
pinpointing the illusory and deceptive nature of name-and-form. As we mentioned
before, scenes fall on the cinema screen only one at a time. Because of the
rapidity of the movie film, it is difficult for one to be aware of this fact.
Now, in the case of a drama, the curtain goes down between acts and the
audience waits for the curtain to go up. But they wait, ready with their glue
to connect the previous act with the one to come, to construct a drama. By the
time a certain scene falls on the cinema screen, the previous one is gone for
good. Scenes to follow have not yet come. Whatever scene falls on the screen,
now, will not stay there. So what we have here, is something illusory, a
deceptive phenomenon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now consider an instance like
this: Sometimes we see a dog, crossing a plank over a stream, stopping half way
through to gaze at the water below. It wags its tail, or growls, or keeps on
looking at and away from the water, again and again. Why does it do so? Seeing
its own image in the water, it imagines that to be another dog. So it either
wags its tail in a friendly way, or growls angrily, or else it keeps on
stealing glances out of curiosity - love, hate, and delusion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this case, the dogs thinks that
it is looking because it sees a dog. But what is really happening? It is just
because it is looking that it sees a dog. If the dog had not looked down, it
would not have seen a dog looking up at it from below, that is to say - its own
image. Now it is precisely this sort of illusion that is going on with regard
to this name-and-form, the preparations, and sense-perception. <b>Here lies the
secret of Dependent Arising</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a flash-back to our film show,
it may be added that if a film reel is played at a time when there is no
spectator, no film show will be registered anywhere, because there is no mind
to put together. It merely flashed on the screen. But if someone had been there
to receive it, to contact with his sense-bases, that is, to see with his eyes,
hear with his ears, and make mental contact with desire, then there comes to be
a film show. And so also in the case of a drama. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Film producers and dramatists
think that the production of the film and the drama is solely their work. But
in the last analysis, it is the audience that gives the film and the drama the
finishing touch, to make them finished products. Similarly, we tend to think
that every object in the world exists in its own right. But then this is what
is called <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>,
the 'personality view', which carries with it the self-bias. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is such a view that made the
dog imagine that there is another dog in the water. It imagined that the dog is
there, even when it is not looking. It may have thought: &quot;I am looking
because a dog appears there&quot;. But the fact is that the dog appears there
because it cares to look. Here, then, we have a case of dependent arising, or <i>pa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The word <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca</i>
has a very deep meaning. The Buddha borrowed many words from the existing
philosophical tradition in India. Sometimes he infused new meanings into them
and adopted them to his terminology. But the term <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca
samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i> is not to be found in any other
philosophical system. The special significance of the term lies in the word <i>pa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On a certain occasion, the Buddha
himself gave a definition to this term <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca
samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>. Now it is fairly well known that
the Buddha declared that all this suffering is dependently arisen. What then is
to be understood by the word <i>dukkha</i>, or 'suffering'? He defines it in
terms of the five grasping groups, or the five aggregates of clinging, as it is
said: <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khittena paÃ±cup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span

</i>&quot;<i>Upav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>, I have declared
that suffering is dependently arisen. Dependent on what? <b>Dependent on
contact</b>.&quot; So from this statement, also, it is clear that the five
groups of grasping arise because of contact, that is by contacting through the
six bases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Considered in this way, a thing is
called dependently arisen because it arises on being touched by the six
sense-bases. That is why it is called <i>anicca</i>, or impermanent. The film
show, for instance, was not something already made, or 'ready made'. It arose
due to contact. The phrase <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata<span

to that contact. What may be called <i>abhisa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata

consciousness, which is established on name-and-form, that can be called <i>abhisa<span

Being unable to give one definite meaning, it suggests several. However, since
we have developed a certain mode of interpretation so far, we propose to give
preference to it before getting down to the commentarial interpretation. Now
let us see whether our mode of interpretation can make this verse meaningful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>First of all, we have to trace the
circumstances which provide the setting for this verse in the <i>Keva<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7693;&#7693;</span>hasutta</i>. The Buddha brings out a past
episode, relating to the company of monks. A certain monk conceived the riddle:
'Where do these four great primaries, earth, water, fire, and air, cease altogether?'
He did not approach the Buddha with his problem, probably because he thought
that somewhere in this world-system those four elements could cease. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So what did he do? As he had
psychic powers he went from heaven to heaven and <i>Brahma </i>realm to <i>Brahma</i>
realm, asking the gods and <i>Brahmas </i>this question: 'Where do these four
primaries cease?' None among the gods and <i>Brahmas</i> could answer. In the
end, <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Brahma</i> himself asked him, why he
took the trouble to come all the way there, when he could have easily consulted
the Buddha. Then that monk approached the Buddha and put the riddle to him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But before answering the riddle,
the Buddha recommended a restatement of it, saying: 'Monk, that is not the way
you should put it. You should have worded it differently.' Now that means that
the question is wrongly put. It is incorrect to ask where the four great
primaries cease. There is a particular way of wording it. And this is how the
Buddha reformulated that riddle: </span></p>

phrase of special significance: <i>na g<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhati</i>,
'does not find a footing'. So the question, as restated, means: &quot;Where do
the four primaries not get a footing?&quot; The question, then, is not about a
cessation of the four primaries, it is not a question of their cessation
somewhere in the world or in the world system. The correct way to put it, is to
ask where the four great primaries do not find a footing. The Buddha adds that
it may also be asked where long and short, fine and coarse, pleasant and
unpleasant, as well as name-and-form are held in check completely. The word <i>uparujjhati</i>
means 'holding in check'. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The other day, we could give only
a general idea of the meaning of this verse in brief, because of the question
of time. Today, we propose to attempt a detailed explanation of it. To start
with, we purposely avoid rendering the first two lines, which appear as the
crux of the whole verse. Taking those two lines as they are, we could
paraphrase the verse as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in a consciousness, that is <i>anidassana,
ananta,</i> and<i> sabbato pabha</i>, that earth, water, fire, and air do not
find a footing. It is in this consciousness that long and short, fine and
coarse, and pleasant and unpleasant, as well as name-and-form, are kept in
check. It is by the cessation of consciousness that all these are held in
check. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now try to sort out the
meaning of the difficult words in the first two lines. First of all, in the
expression <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, there is the term <i>anidassana</i>.
The meaning of the word <i>nidassana</i> is fairly well known. It means
'illustration'. Something that 'throws light on' or 'makes clear' is called <i>nidassana</i>.
This is the basic sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We find an instance of the use of
this word, even in this basic sense, in the first <i>Kosalasutta</i>&nbsp;among
the Tens of the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
It is in connection with the description of <i>abhibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, bases of mastery, where there is a reference to
contemplation devices known as <i>kasi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>. It
is said that even the flax flower can be used initially as a sign for <i>kasi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i> meditation. A flax flower is described in the
following words: <i>Um<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>puppha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>la<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> n<span

name="_ednref224"></a><a href="#_edn224" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[224]</span></span></a>
which may be rendered as: &quot;The flax flower, blue, blue-coloured,
manifesting blue, shining blue&quot;. <i>N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>lanidassana<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> suggests that the flax flower is an illustration
of blue colour, or that it is a manifestation of blue. <i>Anidassana</i> could
therefore be said to refer to whatever does not manifest anything. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact, we have a very good
example in support of this suggested sense in the <i>Kakac<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pamasutta</i>
of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. There we find the
Buddha putting a certain question to the monks in order to bring out a simile:
&quot;Monks, suppose a man comes with crimson, turmeric, indigo or carmine and
says: 'I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear on the sky!' What do you
think, monks, could that man draw pictures and make pictures appear
there?&quot; Then the monks reply: <i>AyaÃ±hi, bhante, <span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>k<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>so ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>

&quot;This sky, Lord, is immaterial and non-illustrative. It is not easy to
draw a picture there or make manifest pictures there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we have the words in support
of the above suggested meaning. The sky is said to be <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>p<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> anidassano</i>, immaterial and non-illustrative. That
is why one cannot draw pictures there or make pictures appear there. There is
nothing material in the sky to make manifest pictures. That is, the sense in
which it is called <i>anidassano</i> in this context. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now see how meaningful that
word is, when used with reference to consciousness as <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>. Why
the sky is said to be non-manifestative we could easily understand by the
simile. But how can consciousness become non-manifestative? First and foremost
we can remind ourselves of the fact that our consciousness has in it the
ability to reflect. That ability is called <i>paccavekkhana</i>, 'looking
back'. Sometimes the Buddha has given the simile of the mirror with reference
to this ability, as for instance in the <i>Ambalatthik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hulov<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i> of the <i>Majjhima

href="#_edn226" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[226]</span></span></a> In the <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nandasutta</i>
of the <i>Khandhasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>,<i> </i>also, he
has used the simile of the mirror.<a name="_ednref227"></a><a href="#_edn227"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[227]</span></span></a>
In the former <i>sutta</i> preached to Venerable <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hula</i>
the Buddha uses the simile of the mirror to stress the importance of reflection
in regard to bodily, verbal, and mental action. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In our last sermon, we gave a
simile of a dog crossing a plank over a stream and looking at its own
reflection in the water.<a name="_ednref228"></a><a href="#_edn228" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[228]</span></span></a>
That, too, is a kind of reflection. But from that we can deduce a certain
principle with regard to the question of reflection, namely, that the word
stands for a mode of becoming deluded as well as a mode of getting rid of the
delusion. What creates a delusion is the way that dog is repeatedly looking
down from his own point of view on the plank to see a dog in the water. That is
unwise reflection born of non-radical attention, <i>ayoniso manasik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. Under the influence of the personality view, <i>sakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, it
goes on looking at its own image, wagging its tail and growling. But wise
reflection born of radical attention, <i>yoniso manasik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
is what is recommended in the <i>Ambalatthik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hulov<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i> with its
thematic repetitive phrase <i>paccavekkhitv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>,

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Wise reflection inculcates the <i>Dhamma
</i>point of view. Reflection based on right view, <i>samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, leads to deliverance. So this
is the twin aspect of reflection. But this we mention by the way. The point we
wish to stress is that consciousness has in it the nature of reflecting
something, like a mirror. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> is a
reference to the nature of the released consciousness of an <i>arahant</i>. It
does not reflect anything. To be more precise, it does not reflect a <i>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, or
name-and-form. An ordinary individual sees a <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, when he reflects, which he calls 'I' and
'mine'. It is like the reflection of that dog, which sees its own delusive
reflection in the water. A non-<i>arahant</i>, upon reflection, sees name-and-form,
which however he mistakes to be his self. With the notion of 'I' and 'mine' he
falls into delusion with regard to it. But the <i>arahant's</i> consciousness
is an unestablished consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

A non-<i>arahant's</i> consciousness is established on name-and-form. The
unestablished consciousness is that which is free from name-and-form and is unestablished
on name-and-form. The established consciousness, upon reflection, reflects
name-and-form, on which it is established, whereas the unestablished
consciousness does not find a name-and-form as a reality. The <i>arahant</i>
has no attachments or entanglements in regard to name-and-form. In short, it is
a sort of penetration of name-and-form, without getting entangled in it. This
is how we have to unravel the meaning of the expression <i>anidassana viÃ±Ã±<span

this sense of <i>anidassana</i>, we may remind ourselves of the fact that
manifestation requires something material. That is obvious even from that
simile picked up at random from the <i>Kakac<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pamasutta</i>.
As for the consciousness of the <i>arahant</i>, the verse in question makes it
clear that earth, water, fire, and air do not find a footing there. </span></p>

that such distinctions as long and short, fine and coarse, and pleasant and

things material. When the consciousness is freed from the four elements, it is
also free from the relative distinctions, which are but the standards of
measurements proper to those elements. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now consider the
implications of the term <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> -
'endless', 'infinite'. We have already said something about the plumbing of the
depth of waters. Since the material elements have faded away in that
consciousness, they are unable to plumb its depth. They no longer serve as an '<b>index</b>'
to that consciousness. Therefore, that consciousness is endless or infinite. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is endless also in another
sense. With regard to such distinctions as 'long' and 'short' we used the word
'<b>relative</b>'. These are relative concepts. We even refer to them as
conjoined pairs of terms. In worldly usage they are found conjoined as 'long
and short', 'fine and coarse', 'pleasant and unpleasant'. There is a dichotomy
about these concepts, there is a bifurcation. It is as if they are put within a
rigid framework.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When, for instance, we go
searching for a piece of wood for some purpose or other, we may say: &quot;This
piece of wood is too long&quot;. Why do we say so? Because we are in need of a
shorter one. Instead of saying that it is not '<b>sufficiently</b>' short, we
say it is too long. When we say it is too short, what we mean is that it is not
sufficiently long. So then, long and short are relevant within one framework.
As a matter of fact, all measurements are relative to some scale or other. They
are meaningful within some framework of a scale. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this sense, too, the
worldling's way of thinking has a tendency to go to extremes. It goes to one
extreme or the other. When it was said that the world, for the most part, rests
on a dichotomy, such as that between the two views 'Is' and 'Is not',<a

this idea of a framework is already implicit. The worldling's ways of thought '<b>end-up</b>'
in one extreme or the other within this framework. The <i>arahant </i>transcends
it, his consciousness is, therefore, endless, <i>ananta</i>. </span></p>

&quot;the truth is not easily seen&quot;, which in effect is an emphatic

truth and that it refers to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. <i>Pa<span

To show its justifiability he says that <i>nat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>
is a synonym for <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,

must be pointed out that it is <i>nati</i> and not <i>nat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>

the acceptability of the reading <i>anata<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
he goes on to say that there is a variant reading, <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
and gives an interpretation in support of it too. In fact, he interprets the
word <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>in more than one sense.
Firstly, because <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is permanent, it
has no end. And secondly it is endless because it is immeasurable, or <i>appam<span

or immeasurable, can have various nuances. But the one we have stressed is the
transcendence of relative concepts, limited by their dichotomous nature. We have
also alluded to the unplumbed depth of the <i>arahant's </i>consciousness, in
which the four elements do not find a footing. </span></p>

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>. J<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lin<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>
is a synonym for craving. It means one who has a net or one who goes netting. <i>Visattik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> refers to the agglutinative character of craving.
It keeps worldlings glued to objects of sense. The verse may be rendered as
follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;He who has no craving, with
nets in and agglutinates to lead him somewhere - by what track could that
Awakened One of infinite range be led - trackless as he is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Because the Buddha is of infinite
range, he is trackless. His path cannot be traced. Craving wields the net of
name-and-form with its glue when it goes ranging. But since the Awakened One
has the '<b>endless</b>' as his range, there is no track to trace him by. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The term <i>anantagocara<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>means one whose range has no end or limit. If,
for instance, one chases a deer, to catch it, one might succeed at least at the
end of the pasture. But the Buddha's range is endless and his 'ranging' leaves
no track. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

But this is not the sense in which we interpret the term here. The very fact
that there is '<b>no object</b>' makes the Buddha's range endless and
untraceable. Had there been an object, craving could have netted him in. In
support of this interpretation, we may allude to the following couple of verses

</i>are very often rich in imagery. The Buddha has on many occasions presented
the <i>Dhamma </i>through deep similes and metaphors. If the metaphorical sense
of a term is ignored, one can easily miss the point. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, the word <i>sannicaya</i>,
in this context, which we have rendered as 'accumulation', is suggestive of the
heaping up of the five aggregates. The word <i>upacaya</i> is sometimes used
with reference to this process of heaping up that goes on in the minds of the
worldlings.<a name="_ednref239"></a><a href="#_edn239" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[239]</span></span></a>
Now this heaping up, as well as the accumulation of <i>kamma</i>, is not there
in the case of an <i>arahant</i>. Also, they have comprehended their food. The
comprehension of food does not mean simply the usual reflection on food in
terms of elements. Nor does it imply just one kind of food, but all the four
nutriments mentioned in the <i>Dhamma</i>, namely <i>kaba<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;</span>i<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, material food, <i>phassa</i>, contact, <i>manosaÃ±cetan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, volition, and <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>,
consciousness.<a name="_ednref240"></a><a href="#_edn240" title=""><span

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The next two lines tell us what
the true range or pasture of the <i>arahants</i> is. It is an echo of the idea
of comprehension of food as well as the absence of accumulation. <i>SuÃ±Ã±ato
animitto ca, vimokkho yesa gocaro</i>, &quot;whose range is the deliverance of the
void and the signless&quot;. When the <i>arahants</i> are in their attainment
to the fruit of <i>arahant</i>-hood, their minds turn towards the void and the
signless. When they are on this feeding-ground, neither <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>
nor craving can catch them with their nets. They are trackless - hence the last
two lines <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>se va
sakunt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, gati
tesa durannay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, </i>&quot;their track is hard to
trace, like that of birds in the sky&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The word <i>gati </i>in this last
line is interpreted by the commentators as a reference to the 'whereabouts' of
the <i>arahants</i> after their <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.<a
name="_ednref241"></a><a href="#_edn241" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[241]</span></span></a>
It has dubious associations of some place as a destination. But in this
context, <i>gati</i> does not lend itself to such an interpretation. It only
refers to their mental compass, which is untraceable, because of their
deliverance trough the void and the signless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The next verse also bring out this
idea. <i>Yass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

&quot;his path is hard to trace, like that of birds in the sky&quot;. This
reminds us of the last line of the verse quoted earlier, <i>apada<span

These two verses, then, throw more light on the meaning of the expression <i>anantagocara</i>
- of infinite range - used as an epithet for the Awakened One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now get at the meaning of
the term <i>sabbato pabham</i>, in the context <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span

</i>In our discussion of the significance of the drama and the cinema we
mentioned that it is the darkness in the background which keeps the audience
entranced in a way that they identify themselves with the characters and react
accordingly.<a name="_ednref244"></a><a href="#_edn244" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[244]</span></span></a>
The darkness in the background throws a spell of delusion. That is what makes
for 'enjoyment'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Of course, there is some sort of
light in the cinema hall. But that is very limited. Some times it is only a
beam of light, directed on the screen. In a previous sermon we happened to
mention that even in the case of a matinee show, dark curtains and closed doors
and windows ensure the necessary dark background.<a name="_ednref245"></a><a
href="#_edn245" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[245]</span></span></a> Here, in this simile, we have a
clue to the meaning <i>sabbato pabha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, luminous
or lustrous on all sides. Suppose a matinee show is going on and one is
enjoying it, entranced and deluded by it. Suddenly doors and windows are flung
open and the dark curtains are removed. Then immediately one slips out of the
cinema world. The film may go on, but because of the light coming from all
sides, the limited illumination on the screen fades away, before the total
illumination. The film thereby loses its enjoyable quality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As far as consciousness, or <i>viÃ±Ã±<span

completely different from wisdom, <i>paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, as
it is defined in the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vedallasutta</i>.
However, there is also a difference between them, <i>paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then one may ask: 'We are
understanding everything with consciousness, so how can one understand
consciousness?' But the Buddha has shown us the way of doing it. Wisdom, when
it is developed, enables one to comprehend consciousness. In short,
consciousness is as narrow as that beam of light falling on the cinema screen.
That is to say, the specifically prepared consciousness, or the consciousness
crammed up in name-and-form, as in the case of the non-<i>arahant</i>. It is as
narrow as the perspective of the audience glued to the screen. The
consciousness of the ordinary worldling is likewise limited and committed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

illuminated on all sides with wisdom? It becomes <i>sabbato pabha<span

comes from all sides, the framework of ignorance fades away. It is that
released consciousness, free from the dark framework of ignorance, that is
called the consciousness which is lustrous on all sides, in that cryptic verse
in question. This lustre, associated with wisdom, has a special significance
according to the discourses. In the <i>Catukkanip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is sufficiently clear, then,
that the allusion is to the luminous mind, the consciousness of the <i>arahant</i>,
which is non-manifestative, infinite, and all lustrous. To revert to the
analogy of the cinema which, at least in a limited sense, helps us to form an
idea about it, we have spoken about the stilling of all preparations.<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[249]</span></span></a>
Now in the case of the film, too, there is a stilling of preparations. That is
to say, the preparations which go to make it a '<b>movie</b>' film are '<b>stilled</b>'.
The multicoloured dresses of actors and actresses become colourless before that
illumination, even in the case of a technicolour film. The scenes on the screen
get blurred before the light that suddenly envelops them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And what is the outcome of it? The
preparations going on in the minds of the audience, whether induced by the film
producers or aroused from within, are calmed down at least temporarily. This
symbolizes, in a limited sense, the significance of the phrase<i> sabbasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rasamatha</i>, the
stilling of all preparations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then what about the relinquishment
of all assets, <i>sabb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>padhipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>inissagga</i>?
In the context of the film show, it is the bundle of experiences coming out of
one's 'vested-interests' in the marvellous cinema world. These assets are
relinquished at least for the moment. Destruction of craving, <i>ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>hakkhayo</i>, is momentarily experienced with regard
to the blurred scenes on the screen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As to the term <i>vir<span

in two senses, that is, dispassion as well as the fading away which brings
about the dispassion.<a name="_ednref250"></a><a href="#_edn250" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[250]</span></span></a>
Now in this case, too, the fading away occurred, not by any other means, but by
the very fact that the limited narrow beam of consciousness got superseded by
the unlimited light of wisdom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Nirodha</span></i><span

cessation, and the film has now ceased to be a film, though the machines are
still active. We have already mentioned that in the last analysis a film is
produced by the audience.<a name="_ednref251"></a><a href="#_edn251" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[251]</span></span></a>
So its cessation, too, is a matter for the audience. This, then, is the
cessation of the film.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now comes <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
extinction or extinguishment. Whatever heated emotions and delirious
excitements that arose out of the film show cooled down, at least momentarily,
when the illumination takes over. This way we can form some idea, somewhat
inferentially, about the meaning and significance of the term <i>sabbato pabha<span

film show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So now we have tackled most of the
difficulties to the interpretation of this verse. In fact, it is the few words
occurring in the first two lines that has posed an insoluble problem to
scholars both eastern and western. We have not yet given the commentarial
interpretation, and that, not out of disrespect for the venerable commentators.
It is because their interpretation is rather hazy and inconclusive. However, we
shall be presenting that interpretation at the end of this discussion, so as to
give the reader an opportunity to compare it with ours. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But for the present, let us
proceed to say something about the last two lines as well. <i>ViÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>assa nirodhena, etth'eta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
uparujjhati</i>. As we saw above, for all practical purposes, name-and-form
seem to cease, even like the fading away of the scenes on the cinema screen.
Then what is meant by this phrase <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>assa
nirodhena</i>, with the cessation of consciousness? The reference here is to
that <i>abhisa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>,
or the specifically prepared consciousness. It is the cessation of that
concocted type of consciousness which was formerly there, like the one directed
on the cinema screen by the audience. With the cessation of that specifically
prepared consciousness, all constituents of name-and-form are said to be held
in check, <i>uparujjhati</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here, too, we have a little
problem. Generally, <i>nirujjhati </i>and <i>uparujjhati</i> are regarded as
synonymous. The way these two verbs are used in some <i>suttas</i> would even
suggest that they mean the same thing. As a matter of fact, even the <i>C<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;&#7735;</span>aNiddesa</i>, which is a very old commentary,
paraphrases <i>uparujjhati</i> by <i>nirujjhati</i>: <i>uparujjhat<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Nevertheless, in the context of
this particular verse, there seems to be something deep involved in the
distinction between these two verbs. Even at a glance, the two lines in
question are suggestive of some distinction between them. <i>ViÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>assa nirodhena, etth'eta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
uparujjhati</i>, the <i>nirodha </i>of consciousness is said to result in the <i>uparodha
</i>of whatever constitutes name-and-form. This is intriguing enough. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But that is not all. By way of
preparing the background for the discussion, we have already made a brief
allusion to the circumstances in which the Buddha uttered this verse.<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[253]</span></span></a>
What provided the context for its utterance was a riddle that occurred to a
certain monk in a moment of fancy. The riddle was: 'Where do these four great
primaries cease altogether?' There the verb used is <i>nirujjhanti</i>.<a
name="_ednref254"></a><a href="#_edn254" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[254]</span></span></a>
So in order to find where they cease, he whimsically went from heaven to heaven
and from <i>Brahma</i>-world to <i>Brahma-</i>world. As we mentioned earlier,
too, it was when the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Brahma</i> directed
that monk to the Buddha, saying: 'Why 'on earth' did you come all this way when
the Buddha is there to ask?', that the Buddha reworded the question. He pointed
out that the question was incorrectly worded and revised it as follows, before
venturing to answer it: </span></p>

Where do water, earth, fire, and air find no footing? Or where do they not get
established? In short, here is a word suggestive of plumbing the depth of a
reservoir. We may hark back to the simile given earlier, concerning the
plumbing of the consciousness with the perception of form. Where do the four
elements not find a footing? Also, where are such relative distinctions as long
and short, subtle and gross, pleasant and unpleasant, as well as name-and-form,
completely held in check?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the Buddha has purposely avoided the use of the verb <i>nirujjhati</i>.

'does not find a footing', 'does not plumb', and <i>uparujjhati</i>, 'is held

that the materialists of today conceive of. It is, in itself, a fallacy. To say
that the four elements <b>cease</b> somewhere in the world, or in the universe,
is a contradiction in terms. Why? Because the very question: 'Where do they
cease?', presupposes an answer in terms of those elements, by way of defining
that place. This is the kind of uncouth question an ordinary materially
inclined person would ask. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

question. You should not ask 'where' the four great primaries cease, but rather
where they, as well as the concepts of long and short, subtle and gross,
pleasant and unpleasant, and name-and-form, are held in check.' The question
proper is not where the four great primaries cease, but where they do not get
established and where all their accompaniments are held in check. </span></p>

relating the concept of matter, which the world takes for granted, to the
perception of form arising in the mind. The four great primaries haunt the
minds of the worldlings like ghosts, so they have to be exorcised from their
minds. It is not a question of expelling them from this world, or from any
heavenly realm, or the entire world-system. That exorcism should take place in
this very consciousness, so as to put an end to this haunting. </span></p>

consciousness, which was bound, glued, committed and limited, becomes fully
released, due to the light of wisdom, to become non-manifestative, endless, and

before coming to this verse in his commentary to the <i>Keva<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7693;&#7693;</span>hasutta</i>,
gives an explanation as to why the Buddha reformulated the original question of
that monk. According to him, the question: 'Where do the four great primaries
cease?', implied both the organic and the inorganic aspects of matter, and in revising
it, the Buddha limited its scope to the organic. In other words, Venerable <i>Buddhaghosa</i>
presumes that the revised version has to be interpreted with reference to this
human body. Hence he explains such words as 'long' and 'short', occurring in
the verse, in a limited sense as referring to the body's stature. How facile
this interpretation turns out to be, one can easily discern as we go on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ghaÃ±ca rassaÃ±ca</i>, long and short, as relative
distinctions of a person's height, that is tallness and shortness. Similarly,
the words <i>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>u<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
th<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>la<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, </i>subtle
and gross, are said to mean the small and big in the size of the body. Likewise
<i>subha </i>and <i>asubha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> are taken to
refer to the comely and the ugly in terms of body's appearance. </span></p>

to be the name of the person and <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>is
his form or shape. All this goes to show that the commentator has gone off at a
tangent, even in the interpretation of this verse, which is more or less the
prologue to such an intricate verse as the one in question. He has blundered at
the very outset in limiting the scope of those relative terms to the organic,
thereby obscuring the meaning of that deep verse. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

do not refer to the stature and size of some person. What they convey is the
dichotomous nature of concepts in the world. All those deeper implications are
obscured by the reference to a person's outward appearance. The confusion
becomes worse confounded, when <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>maÃ±ca r<span

the sense that it is 'to be known', <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tabba<span

since such a usage is not attested elsewhere. Moreover, we come across a long
list of epithets for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, as many as thirty-three,
in the <i>Asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khatasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>

is called <i>anidassana</i> because no illustration for it could be given. The
idea is that it has nothing to compare with. Then comes the explanation of the
word <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>. According to the commentator
<i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is called <i>ananta</i>, endless,
because it has neither the arising-end,<i> upp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>danto</i>,

persisting-end, <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>hitassa aÃ±Ã±athatta</i>.
Strangely enough, even the last mentioned middle-state is counted as an 'end'

the term <i>sabbato pabha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>is even more
confusing. The word <i>pabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> is explained as a
synonym for <i>papa</i>, meaning 'ford'. The <i>bha</i> element in the word, he
explains, is a result of consonantal interchange with the original <i>pa</i> in
<i>papa</i>. <i>Pak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rassa pana bhak<span

particular term for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is <i>sabbato
papa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>. The meaning attributed to it is 'with
fords on all sides'. <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is supposed to
be metaphorically conceived as the ocean, to get down into which there are
fords on all sides, namely the thirty-eight topics of meditation. This
interpretation seems rather far fetched. It is as if the commentator has
resorted to this simile of a ford, because he is already 'in deep waters'! The
word <i>pabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, as it is, clearly means light,
or radiance, and its association with wisdom is also well attested in the
canon. </span></p>

problem. In the <i>Brahmanimantanikasutta </i>of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span

lustrous than anything else. For there is nothing more lustrous or luminous or
purer or whiter than <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&quot;. In this
interpretation <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is even regarded as
something white in colour! </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The etymology of the term <i>sabbato
pabha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> has been given a twist, for the word <i>sabbato</i>
is taken in a comparative sense, 'more lustrous than anything'. As we have
pointed out, the term actually means 'lustrous on all sides'. Then a second
interpretation is given, bringing in the word <i>pabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i>,
'lord' or 'chief'. <i>Sabbato v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> pabh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i>, that is to say more prominent than anything else.
In support of it he says: <i>Asukadis<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya n<span

such a direction <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is not to be
found&quot;. He says that it is called <i>pabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i>,
or lord, because it is to be found in all directions. Only as the third

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The gist of this paragraph is that
the non-manifestative consciousness which is infinite and all lustrous, is free
from the qualities associated with any of the concepts in the list, such as the
earthiness of earth and the wateriness of water. That is to say it is not under
their influence, it does not partake of them, <i>ananubh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>. Whatever nature the world attributes to these
concepts, whatever reality they invest it with, that is not registered in this
non-manifestative consciousness. That is why this consciousness is said to be
uninfluenced by them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Usually, the worldlings attribute
a certain degree of reality to concepts in everyday usage. These may be
reckoned as mind-objects, things that the mind attends to. The word <i>dhamma</i>
also means 'a thing', so the worldling thinks that there is some-'thing' in
each of these concepts. Or, in other words, they believe that there is
some-thing as an inherent nature or essence in these objects of the mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But the quotation in question
seems to imply that this so-called nature is not registered in the <i>arahant's</i>
mind. It is extremely necessary for the worldling to think that there is some
real nature in these mind-objects. Why? Because in order to think of them as
objects they have to have some essence, at least they must be invested with an
essence, and so the worldlings do invest them with some sort of an essence, and
that is the earthiness of earth, the wateriness of water, (etc.). Likewise
there is a being-hood in beings, a <i>deva</i>-hood in <i>devas</i>, a <i>Paj<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>pati</i>-hood in <i>Paj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>pati</i>,
a <i>Brahma</i>-hood in <i>Brahma</i>, so much so that even in the concept of
all, there is an all-ness - and this is the worldlings' standpoint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Attributing a reality to whatever
concept that comes up, the worldlings create for themselves perceptions of
permanence, perceptions of the beautiful, and perceptions of self. In other
words, they objectify these concepts in terms of craving, conceit and views.
That objectification takes the form of some inherent nature attributed to them,
such as earthiness, <i>deva</i>-hood (etc.). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But as for the non-manifestative
consciousness, it is free from the so-called natures that delude the
worldlings. In the consciousness of the <i>arahants</i>, there is not that
infatuation with regard to the mass of concepts which the worldlings imagine as
real, in order to keep going this drama of existence. This fact is clearly
borne out by another statement in the <i>Brahmanimantanikasutta</i>. The Buddha
makes the following declaration, to break the conceit of <i>Baka </i>the <i>Brahma</i>,
who conceived the idea of permanence regarding his status as a <i>Brahma</i>: </span></p>

come into usage, a few instances of which have been mentioned here. So, with
regard to this earth, one can conceive of it as 'my earth', or as 'I am on earth',
or 'I who am on the earth', or 'from the earth'. By holding on tenaciously to
these declensional forms of one's own creation, one is only asserting one's

be 're-called'. A perception of permanence which enables one to think about it
again, arises out of it. This is the idea behind the above reference. </span></p>

is not subject to them. &quot;I did not claim to be earth, I did not claim to
be on earth, I did not claim to be from earth, I did not claim earth as mine, I
did not assert earth&quot;, <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here the word <i>abhivadi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> is suggestive of conceit. The three terms <i>abhinandati</i>,<i>
abhivadati </i>and <i>ajjhos<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya ti<span

<i>Abhinandati</i> means delighting in particular, which is suggestive of
craving. <i>Abhivadati</i> means an assertion by way of conceit - an assertion
which implies 'a taking up' of something. <i>Ajjhos<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya
ti<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hati</i> stands for dogmatic
involvement regarding views. Thus <i>abhinandati</i>,<i> abhivadati </i>and <i>ajjhos<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya ti<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hati</i>
correspond to the three terms <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, craving, <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
conceit, and <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, views,
respectively. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now out of these, what we find
here is <i>abhivadati</i> - <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhivadi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;I did not assert earth&quot; - I did not make
any assertion about earth by way of conceit. From this, too, we can infer that
the ordinary man in this world takes his perception of the earth seriously, and
by conceiving of it as 'earth is mine', 'I am on the earth', (etc.), invests
the concepts with a permanent nature. But this is a kind of device the
worldlings adopt in order to perpetuate the drama of existence. However,
everyone of these elements is void. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this particular context, the
four elements earth, water, fire and air, are mentioned at the very outset. The
Buddha, having understood the emptiness and impermanence of these elements,
does not cling to them. The ordinary worldling, on the other hand, clings to
the perception of earth in a piece of ice because of its hardness. But as we know,
when we heat it up to a certain degree, its watery quality reveals itself.
Further heating would bring up its fiery nature. Continuous heating will
convert it into vapour, revealing its air quality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Thus these four great primaries,
which the world clings to, also have the nature of impermanence about them. The
emancipated one, who rightly understands this impermanence through his higher
knowledge, does not get upset by their ghostly configurations. His
consciousness is not subject to them. This is the import of the above
paragraph. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The same holds true with regard to
the other concepts. <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
beings have their conventional usages. One might think of oneself as a god
among gods. Now <i>Baka</i> the <i>Brahma</i> had the conceit 'I am a <i>Brahma</i>'.
But even his <i>Brahma</i>-status gets melted away like that piece of ice, at
least after some aeons. So even <i>Brahma</i>-hood is subject to 'liquidation',
like an ice-cube. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this way, the released
consciousness of the <i>arahant</i> does not register a perception of
permanence with regard to the concepts which masquerade as real in the
worldling's drama of existence. That is why it is called 'non-manifestative'
consciousness. That non-manifestative consciousness is free from those
concepts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of further explanation of the
nature of this released mind, we may drop a hint through the analogy of the
film and the drama, which we have employed throughout. Now, for instance, in
order to produce a tragic scene on the screen, the film producers adopt subtle
devices and camera tricks. Sometimes an awe-inspiring scene of conflagration or
ruthless arson, which drives terror into the hearts of the audience, is
produced with the help of cardboard houses. Cardboard houses are set on fire,
but the audience is hoodwinked into thinking that a huge mansion is on fire.
Similarly, terrific traffic accidents are displayed on the screen with the help
of a few toys. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this drama of existence, too,
there are similar tragic scenes. Now, in spite of their tragic quality, if any
member of the audience truly understands at that moment that these are
cardboard houses and toys toppled from hill tops, he sees something comic in
the apparently tragic. Likewise, in this drama of existence, there is a tragic
aspect as well as a comic aspect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, both these
words, tragic and comic, can be accommodated within the highly significant term
<i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>vega</i>, anguish, sense of urgency. In
trying to arouse <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>vega</i> with regard to <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, or
preparations, we could bring in both these attitudes. The ordinary worldling
sees only the tragic side of the drama of existence, and that because of his
ignorance. But the <i>arahant</i>, the emancipated one, sees in this drama of
existence a comic side as well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As an illustration we may allude
to those occasions in which the Buddha himself and those disciples with psychic
powers like Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggal<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, are said to have shown a faint smile, <i>situpp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, on seeing how beings in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> are reborn in high and low realms according to
their deeds, as in a puppet show.<a name="_ednref266"></a><a href="#_edn266"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[266]</span></span></a>
Of course, that spontaneous smile has nothing sarcastic or unkind about it. But
all the same, it gives us a certain hint. This spontaneous smile seems to be
the outcome of an insight into the comic aspect of this existential drama. The
faint smile is aroused by the conviction of the utter futility and
insubstantiality of the existential drama, seeing how beings who enjoyed high
positions come down to the level of hungry ghosts, <i>petas</i>, or even to
lower realms in their very next birth. It is somewhat like the response of one
who has correctly understood the impermanence and the illusory nature of things
shown on a film screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When one comes to think of this
drama of existence, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>
beings appear like puppets drawn upwards by the five higher fetters, <i>uddhambh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>giya sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yojana</i>, and
drawn downwards by the five lower fetters, <i>orambh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>giya
sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yojana</i>. They reappear more or less like
puppets, manipulated up and down by strings, which are but the results of their
own deeds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The wherewithal for the drama of
existence is supplied by the four great primaries - the four basic elements of
earth, water, fire and air. In the case of a film or a drama, sometimes the
same object can be improvised in a number of ways, to produce various scenes
and acts. What in one scene serves as a sitting-stool, could be improvised as a
footstool in another scene, and as a table in yet another. Similarly, there is
something called double-acting in films. The same actor can delineate two
characters and appear in different guises in two scenes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A similar state of affairs is to
be found in this drama of existence. In fact, the Buddha has declared that
there is not a single being in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> who has not been one of our relations at some
time or other.<a name="_ednref267"></a><a href="#_edn267" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[267]</span></span></a>
We are in the habit of putting down such relations to a distant past, in order
to avoid a rift in our picture of the world by upsetting social conventions.
But when one comes to think of it in accordance with the <i>Dhamma</i>, and
also on the strength of certain well attested facts, sometimes the male or the
female baby cuddled by a mother could turn out to be her own dead father or
mother. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such a strangely ludicrous
position is to be found in the acts of this drama of existence. Usually the
world is unaware of such happenings. Though ludicrous, the world cannot afford
to laugh at it. Rather, it should be regarded as a sufficient reason for
arousing an anguished sense of urgency: 'What a pity that we are subject to
such a state of affairs! What a pity that we do not understand it because of
the power of influxes and latencies and thereby heap up defilements!'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such an awareness of the emptiness
of all this can give rise to anguish. One can get some understanding on the
lines of the signless, the unsatisfactory, and the void, by contemplating these
facts. One can also contemplate on the four elements, how they are at the
beginning of a world period, and how they get destroyed at the end of a world
period, in the conflagration at the end of an aeon. Likewise, when one comes to
think of the state of persons or beings in general, in accordance with this
fact of relationship, there is much room for anguish and a sense of urgency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is because of all this that the
Buddha sometimes declares, as in the discourse on the rising of seven suns, <i>Sattasuriyasutta</i>,
that this is &quot;enough to get disenchanted with all preparations, enough to
get detached from them, enough to get released from them&quot;, <i>alameva

particular nuance of the term <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

those instruments, temporarily improvised in a dramatic performance just for the
purpose of producing various acts on the stage. It is the same with persons,
who are like actors playing their parts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Beings, who are born in accordance
with their karma, entertain the conceit 'I am a god', 'I am a <i>Brahma</i>'.
Once their karma is spent up, they get destroyed and are reborn somewhere or
other. It is the same with those items used in a drama, such as the stool and
the footstool. But the intriguing fact is that those in the audience, watching
each of those acts, grasp as such whatever objects they see on the stage when
they produce their individual dramas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have already mentioned at the
very outset that the final stage in the production of a drama is a matter for
the audience and not for the theatricians. Each member of the audience creates
a drama in his own mind, putting together all preparations. What serves as a
stool in one act of the drama, may be used as a footstool in the next. In the
first instance it sinks into the minds of the audience as a stool, and in the
next as a footstool. It is the same in the case of beings and their
relationships. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It must have been due to this
state of affairs in the drama of existence, which arouses anguish, that the
Buddha makes the declaration in quite a number of discourses dealing with the
topic of impermanence, including those which describe the destruction of the
aeon: 'This is enough, monks, to get disenchanted with all preparations, to get
detached from them, to get released from them'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These preparations are comparable
to a film reel, which is the basic requirement for the film of name-and-form
shown on the screen of consciousness of beings in this world. As the world is
regarded as a sort of stage, trees, beings and objects in our environment are
like objects on the stage. But the intriguing fact about it is that the
ordinary man in the world is unaware of their 'prepared' nature as a framework.

becomes unaware of the fact that it is just something shown on the screen. At
that moment it appears as something real and life-like. It is about this
apparent reality that the Buddha speaks when he utters the following lines in
the <i>Itivuttaka</i>:<i> J<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

as real in this world, is actually made and prepared by <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self nature, that is hinted at by these
lines. </span></p>

aware of its impermanent nature, is therefore free from these preparations. It
is free from those concepts which the worldlings cling to. It remains unshaken
by their ghostly transfigurations. We come across four wonderful verses in the <i>Adhimutta

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With the complete fading away and
cessation of ignorance, the <i>arahant </i>has no notion of a body. That is, he
does not have a perception of a body, like that of a worldling, who takes it as
such, due to his perception of the compact, <i>ghanasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
Likewise that speech is not there, <i>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> v<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>c<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> na hoti</i>. The basic
reason for speech-preparation is the reality attributed to words and linguistic
usages. When, for instance, someone scolds us, we are displeased at it because
of the reality given to those words. Similarly, that mind is not there, <i>so
mano na hoti. </i>It is only the collocation of preparations which arise and
cease that is conceived as 'my mind'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Therefore, whatever field, site,
base or reason, owing to which there can arise inward pleasure or pain, is no
longer there. If the bandits had actually killed him, he would not have had any
mental pain, because he lets go before <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>comes
to grab. This is the idea expressed in the first verse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As for the second verse, there too
the idea of voidness is well expressed. The thought 'I was', does not occur to
me. The idea 'I am' is not in me. Nor do I entertain the idea 'I will be'. That
is to say, it does not occur to me that I had a past or that I will have a
future. It only occurs to me that preparations get destroyed. That was what
happened in the past and will happen in the future. So what is there to lament?
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A very important idea emerges from
these verses. Now this series of sermons is on the subject of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. We thought of giving these sermons because of
the existing variety of conflicting views on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
There is no clear idea even about our goal, not only among non-Buddhists, but
even among Buddhists themselves. From these verses we can glean some important
facts. Here the reference is to existence. This <i>arahant </i>must have had
numerous births as <i>pretas</i>, <i>Brahmas</i>, gods, and human beings. But
he is not saying something false here. What is really meant by saying that it
does not occur to me 'I was'? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Ordinary worldlings, or even those
with higher psychic powers, when they see their past lives think of it as 'I
was so and so in such and such a birth'. Sometimes one entertains a conceit at
the thought 'I was a god', 'I was a <i>Brahma</i>'. If he had been an animal or
a <i>preta</i>, he is somewhat displeased. Such is not the case with this <i>arahant</i>.
He sees that what was in the past is a mere heap of preparations, and what will
be in the future is again a heap of preparations. It is like the case of that
cinema goer who understands that whatever comes up in the film is artificially
got up. It is a state of mind aroused by wisdom. 'So what is there to lament',
is the attitude resulting from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On an earlier occasion, we

existence.<a name="_ednref277"></a><a href="#_edn277" title=""><span

Now as to this process of winding and unwinding, we may take as an illustration
the case of a rope. There is a winding and an unwinding in it. We can form an
idea about the nature of this existence even with the help of a simple
illustration. </span></p>

Not only those <i>brahmins </i>and heretics believing in a soul theory, but
even some Buddhist scholars are scared of the term <i>bhavanirodha</i>, fearing
that it leads to a nihilistic interpretation of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
That is why they try to mystify <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> in
various ways. What is the secret behind this attitude? It is simply the lack of
a clear understanding of the unique philosophy made known by the Buddha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Before the advent of the Buddha, the
world conceived of existence in terms of a perdurable essence as 'being', <i>sat</i>.
So the idea of destroying that essence of being was regarded as
annihilationism. It was some state of a soul conceived as 'I' and 'mine'. But
according to the law of dependent arising made known by the Buddha, existence
is something that depends on grasping, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napaccay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> bhavo</i>. It is
due to grasping that there comes to be an existence. This is the pivotal point
in this teaching. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the case of the footstool,
referred to earlier, it became a footstool when it was used as such. If in the
next act it is used to sit on, it becomes a stool. When it serves as a table,
it becomes a table. Similarly in a drama, the same piece of wood, which in one
act serves as a walking stick to lean on, could be seized as a stick to beat
with, in the next act. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the same way, there is no
essential thing-hood in the things taken as real by the world. They appear as
things due to cravings, conceits and views. They are conditioned by the mind,
but these psychological causes are ignored by the world, once concepts and
designations are superimposed on them. Then they are treated as real objects
and made amenable to grammar and syntax, so as to entertain such conceits and
imaginings as, for instance, 'in the chair', 'on the chair', 'chair is mine',
and so on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such a tendency is not there in
the released mind of the <i>arahant</i>. He has understood the fact that
existence is due to grasping, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napaccay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> bhavo</i>.
Generally, in the explanation of the law of dependent arising, the statement
'dependent on grasping, becoming' is supposed to imply that one's next life is
due to one's grasping in this life. But this becoming is something that goes on
from moment to moment. Now, for instance, what I am now holding in my hand has
become a fan because I am using it as a fan. Even if it is made out of some
other material, it will still be called a fan. But if it were used for some
other purpose, it could become something else. This way we can understand how
existence is dependent on grasping. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We began our discussion with the
statement that existence is a heap of windings and unwindings. Let us now think
of a simple illustration. Suppose a rope or a cord is being made up by winding
some strands from either end by two persons. For the strands to gather the
necessary tension, the two persons have to go on winding in opposite
directions. But for the sake of an illustration, let us imagine a situation in
which a third person catches hold of the strands in the middle, just before the
other two start their winding. Oddly enough, by mistake, those two start
winding in the same direction. Both are unaware of the fact that their winding
is at the same time an unwinding. The one in the middle, too, is ignorant that
it is his tight grasp in the middle which is the cause of stress and tension. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To all appearance, a cord is being
made up which may be taken as two cords on either side of the one who has his
hold on the middle. However, viewed from a distance, for all practical purposes
it is just one cord that is being winded up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To introduce a note of discord
into this picture, let us suppose that the man in the middle suddenly lets go
of his hold with a 'twang'. Now what happens to the cord? The windings in the
same direction from both ends, which made it a cord, immediately get
neutralized and <b>the cord ceases to be a cord</b>! Something like the
stilling of all preparations and the abandonment of all assets happens at that
moment. One realizes, 'as-it-is', that no real cord existed at all. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The same state of affairs prevails
in this world. The impermanence of this world, according to the Buddha, does
not affect us so long as there is no grasping on our part. All windings in this
world get unwinded immediately. This is the nature of the world. This is what
is meant by <i>udayabbaya</i>, or rise and fall. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now what happens if there is no
grasping in the middle while the winding is going on in the same direction from
both ends? No cord at all is made up, even if the two at either end go on
winding for aeons and aeons. Why? Simply because they are winding in the same
direction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the same in the case of the
world. The impermanence we see around us in this world does not affect us by
itself. We are affected only when we grasp. It is the grasp in the middle that
accounts for the cord, or rather, for whatever <b>has the semblance of a cord</b>.
In fact, this is what the worldlings call 'the world'. This is what they take
as <b>real</b>. Now what is the consequence of taking it to be real? If it is
real and permanent, whatever is contrary to it, is annihilation, the
destruction of a real world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Keeping in mind the meaning of the
Buddha's dictum 'dependent on grasping is existence', <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napaccay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> bhavo</i>, if
one cares to reflect on this little illustration, one would realize that there
is actually nothing real to get destroyed. There is no self or soul at all to
get destroyed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, the
impermanence of the world is a process of momentary arisings and ceasings.
Given the grasping in the middle, that is to say, 'dependent on grasping is
becoming', the other links follow suit, namely 'dependent on becoming, birth;
dependent on birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
despair arise', <i>bhavapaccay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is somewhat like the unpleasant
tension caused by the winding, in the person who has a grasp at the middle. We
have already referred to a short aphorism which sums up the content of the
insight of those who realize the fruits of the path, like that of a
stream-winner, namely, <i>ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> kiÃ±ci

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It does not seem to say anything
significant, on the face of it. But it succinctly expresses the plainest
conviction a stream-winner gets of the innocent process of arising and ceasing
in the world. It is as if the one who had his grasp in the middle lets go of
his hold for a while, through the power of the path moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in the nature of the
ordinary worldling to hold on, and to hang on. That is why the man who grasped
the cord in the middle refuses to let go of his hold in the midst of windings
and unwindings, however much hardship he has to undergo in terms of sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair. For him, it is extremely difficult to let
go. Until a Buddha arises in the world and proclaims the <i>Dhamma</i>, the
world stubbornly refuses to let go. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if one gives up the tendency
to grasp, at least for a short while by developing the noble eightfold path at
its supramundane level, and lets go even for one moment, then one understands
as one grasps again that now there is less stress and tension. Personality
view, doubt and dogmatic adherence to rules and observances, <i>sakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, <i>vicikicch<span

unwinding has occurred to some extent. The strands of the cord are less taut
now. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>One also understands, at the moment
of arising from that supramundane experience, that one comes back to
'existence' because of grasping, because of the tendency to hold on. That this
tendency to hold on persists due to influxes and latencies - due to unabandoned
defilements - is also evident to him. This, in effect, is the immediate
understanding of the law of dependent arising. It seems, then, that we have
here in this simile of the cord, a clue to an understanding of the nature of
this existence. </span></p>

The true significance of this synonym has not been understood. It means stable
or immovable. Of course, we do come across this term in such contexts as <i>nicca<span

&quot;permanent, stable, eternal, not liable to passing away&quot;, when <i>Brahma

these terms are more or less related to each other in sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then, in which sense is <i>Nibb<span

is why it is referred to as <i>acala<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> sukha<span

&quot;unshakeable bliss&quot;. The term <i>akupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
cetovimutti</i>, &quot;unshakeable deliverance of the mind&quot;, expresses the
same idea. Sometimes the Buddha refers to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>

one's life time, they get shaken up at death. The final winning post is the
pain of death. That is the critical moment at which one can judge one's own
victory or defeat. Before the pain of death, all other deliverances of the mind
fall back defeated. But this deliverance, this unshakeable deliverance with its
'let go' strategy at the approach of death, gets never shaken. It is
unshakeable. That is why it is called the bliss unshaken, <i>acala<span

too, we have such an instance. Unfortunately the commentators have used the
term <i>sassata </i>to define <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The main reason behind this is the
misconception regarding existence - that there is an existence in truth and

that there is the conceit 'am' in this world. All other religious teachers were
concerned with the salvation of a real 'I'. Or, in other words, to confer
immortality on this 'I'. The Buddha, on the contrary, declared that what
actually '<b>is</b>' there, is a conceit - the conceit 'am'. All what is
necessary is the dispelling of this conceit. That is why we sometimes come
across such references to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> as <i>samm<span

Why? Because one has been winding all this time imagining this to be a real cord
or rope. One remains ignorant of the true state of affairs, due to one's grasp
in the middle. But the moment one lets go, one understands. </span></p>

What accounts for its weight is the very tenacity with which one clings to it.
This the worldlings do not understand. So they cling on to the rope, for fear
of getting destroyed. But if one lets go of one's hold, even for a moment, one
would see that the tensed strands will get relaxed at least for that moment -
that there is an immediate unwinding. Full understanding of that unwinding will

soul, and <i>vibhava</i> as its destruction. But here the word <i>vibhava</i>,
in <i>vibhavissanti</i>,<i> </i>refers to the destructions of preparations.
There is nothing lamentable about it. In the context of a drama, they are the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;To one who sees the arising
of pure phenomena and the sequence of pure preparations as it is, there is no
fear, oh headman&quot;. This verse, too, has a depth of meaning, which we shall
now try to elucidate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why are the phenomena qualified by
the word pure, <i>suddha dhamma</i>, in this context? Because the mind-objects,
which are generally regarded as <i>dhamma</i> by the world, are impure. Why are
they impure? Because they are 'influenced' by influxes. Now here we have
'uninfluenced' or influx-free phenomena. To the <i>arahant's </i>mind the
objects of the world occur free of influxes. That is to say, they do not go to
build up a prepared, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. They are
quasi-preparations. They do not go to build up a film show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If, for instance, one who is
seeing a film show, has the full awareness of the artificiality of those
library-shots which go to depict a tragic scene on the screen, without being
carried away by the latency to ignorance, one will not be able to 'enjoy' the
film show. In fact, the film show does not exist for him. The film show has
'ceased' for him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, the <i>arahant</i> sees
phenomena as pure phenomena. Those mind-objects arise only to cease, that is
all. They are merely a series of preparations, <i>suddha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rasantati<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>. 'The film reel is just being played' - that is
the way it occurs to him. Therefore, &quot;to one who sees all this, there is
no fear, oh headman&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us try to give an illustration
for this, too, by way of an analogy. As we know, when a sewing machine goes
into action, it sews up two folds of cloth together. But supposing suddenly the
shuttle runs out of its load of cotton. What happens then? One might even
mistake the folds to be actually sewn up, until one discovers that they are
separable. This is because the conditions for a perfect stitch are lacking. For
a perfect stitch, the shuttle has to hasten and put a knot every time the
needle goes down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for the <i>arahant</i>, the
shuttle refuses to put in the knot. For him, preparations, or <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, are
ineffective in producing a prepared, or <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>.
He has no cravings, conceits and views. For knots of existence to occur, there
has to be an attachment in the form of craving, a loop in the form of conceit,
and a tightening in the form of views. So, then, the <i>arahant's</i> mind
works like a sewing machine with the shuttle run out of its load of cotton.
Though referred to as 'functional consciousness', its function is not to build
up a prepared, since it is influx-free. The phenomena merely come up to go
down, just like the needle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why is ignorance given as the
first link in the formula of dependent arising? It is because the entire series
is dependent on ignorance. It is not a temporal sequence. It does not involve
time. That is why the <i>Dhamma</i> is called timeless, <i>ak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lika</i>.
It is the stereotype interpretation of the formula of dependent arising in
terms of three lives that has undermined the immediate and timeless quality of
the <i>Dhamma</i>. Since ignorance is the root cause of all other conditions,
inclusive of becoming, <i>bhava</i>, birth, <i>j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>,
and decay-and-death, <i>jar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, that state of affairs immediately ceases with
the cessation of ignorance. This, then, is the reason for the last line, <i>na
bhaya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> hoti g<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mani</i>,
&quot;there is no fear, oh headman&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Deathlessness, <i>amata</i>,<i> </i>means
the absence of the fear of death. The fear that the world has about death is
something obsessional. It is like the obsessional dread aroused by the sight of
an anthill due to its association with a cobra. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, this body has
been compared to an anthill in the <i>Vammikasutta</i> of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.<a name="_ednref293"></a><a href="#_edn293"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[293]</span></span></a>
This bodily frame, made up of the four elements, procreated by parents and built
up with food and drink, is metaphorically conceived as an anthill. The
discourse says: &quot;Take the knife, oh wise one, and dig in.&quot; The world
has the obsession that there is a real cobra of a self inside this anthill. But
once it is dug up, what does one find? One discovers an <i>arahant</i>, who has
realized selflessness, a selfless cobra, worthy of honour. Of course, this
might sound as a post-script on <i>Vammikasutta</i>, but the metaphor is so
pregnant with meaning, that it can well accommodate this interpretation, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The world has a
'perception-of-the-compact', <i>ghanasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
with regard to this body made up of the four elements. Because of that very
perception or notion of compactness, there is a fear of death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is birth, because there is
existence. Now this might, on analysis, give us an insight into the law of
dependent arising. The term <i>j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>, or birth,
generally calls to mind the form of a child coming out of the mother's womb.
But in this context the Buddha uses the term in relation to <i>bhava</i>, or
existence, which in its turn is related to <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, or grasping. It is at the time we use something
as a footstool that a footstool is 'born'. When it has ceased to serve that
purpose, the footstool is 'dead'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in this sense that all
assets, <i>upadhi</i>, are said to be of a nature to be born,<i> j<span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[294]</span></span></a>
&quot;all these assets, monks, are of the nature to be born&quot;. Not only the
animate objects, like wife and children, men and women slaves, etc., but even
gold and silver are mentioned there as of a nature to be born. Now let us
ponder over this statement. How can gold and silver be born? How can they grow
old? They are born because of craving, conceit and views. They come into
existence. They are born. Because of birth, they grow old. Therefore they
become objects for sorrow, lamentation and the like to arise. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For one who looks upon them as
pure preparations, all those objects do not crystallize into 'things'. The
description of the non-manifestative consciousness in the <i>Brahmanimantanikasutta</i>
looks like a riddle in the form of a jumble of negative terms like <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hosim,

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,<i> </i>(etc.), &quot;I did not claim to be
earth, I did not claim to be in earth, I did not claim to be from earth&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But what is the general idea
conveyed by these expressions? The implication is that the <i>arahant</i> looks
upon all those concepts, which the worldlings make use of to make up an
existence and to assert the reality of this drama of existence, as mere
pretensions. He is convinced of their vanity and insubstantiality. As we have
already explained with the simile of the sewing machine, an existence does not
get stitched up or knitted up. The cessation of existence is experienced then
and there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some seem to think that the <i>arahant</i>
experiences the <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic</i> bliss only after
his death. But the cessation of existence is experienced here and now, <i>di<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>heva dhamme</i>. This is something marvellous
and unknown to any other religious system. It is just at the moment that the
shuttle of the sewing machine runs out of its load of cotton that the cessation
of existence is experienced. It is then that the latencies are uprooted and all
influxes are destroyed. Cravings, conceits and views refuse to play their part,
with the result that mere preparations come up and go down. This is the
ambrosial deathless. It is said that the <i>arahants</i> partake of ambrosial
deathlessness, <i>amata<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> paribhuÃ±janti</i>.<a

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What actually happened in the case
of the Venerable <i>arahant Adhimutta</i> was that the bandit chief understood
the <i>Dhamma</i> and set him free, instead of killing him, and even got
ordained under him. But even if he had killed him, Venerable <i>Adhimutta</i>
would have passed away, experiencing the ambrosial deathless. Why? Because he
can let go before <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> comes to grab. He
is, therefore, fearless. The obsessional fear of death common to worldlings has
vanished. This, then, is the ambrosia. It is not some medicine or delicious drink
for the possession of which gods and demons battle with each other. It is that
bliss of deliverance, the freedom from the fear of death. Needless to say that
it requires no seal of ever-lastingness. </span></p>

expressions of voidness, <i>suÃ±Ã±at<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. When one sees
with wisdom the entire world, that is both the internal and external world, as
comparable to grass and twigs in point of worthlessness, one does not entertain
the conceit 'mine' and therefore does not lament, saying: 'Oh, I have nothing'.
One is not scared of the term <i>bhavanirodha</i>, or cessation of existence.
Why? Because all these are worthless things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here too, we may add something
more by way of explanation, that is as to how things become 'things' in this
world - though this may seem obvious enough. Since we have been so concerned
with dramas, let us take up a dramatic situation from the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A man is hastily walking along a
jungle path. Suddenly his foot strikes against a stone. 'Oh, it is so painful!'
He kicks the stone with a curse. A few more steps, and another stone trips him.
This time it is even more painful. He turns round, quietly, picks up the stone,
cleans it carefully, looking around, wraps it up in his handkerchief and slips
it into his pocket. Both were stones. But why this special treatment? The first
one was a mere pebble, but the second one turned out to be a gem!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The world esteems a gem stone as
valuable because of craving, conceits and views. So the first accident was a
mishap, but the second - a stroke of luck. Now, had all these mishaps and haps
been filmed, it would have become something of a comedy. Everything in our
environment, even our precious possessions like gold, silver, pearls, and gems,
appear like the paraphernalia improvised for a dramatic performance on the
world stage. Once they come on the stage, from backstage, they appear as real
things. Not only do they appear as real, relative to the acts of the drama, but
they get deposited in our minds as such. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is such 'deposits' that become
our aggregates of grasping, or 'assets', which we take along with us in this <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> in the form of
likes and dislikes. Loves and hates contracted in the past largely decide our
behaviour in the present with some sort of subconscious acquiescence, so much
so that we often form attachments and revengeful aversions in accordance with
them. When one comes to think of it, there is something dramatic about it. When
something serves as a footstool in a particular act, it is 'really' a
footstool. When it is improvised to serve as some other thing in the next act,
one is unaware of the fact that it is the same object. One is not aware of the
hoodwink involved in it. Such a state of affairs prevails over the nature of
preparations, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Being ignorant of the fact that
these are purely preparations, the worldlings take concepts too seriously, to
come to conclusions such as 'I was so and so in such and such a birth', thereby
clinging on to all the animate and inanimate objects in the world. They are
actually comparable to things temporarily improvised to depict a particular
scene in a drama or a film show. That is why we compared the four elements to
ghosts.<a name="_ednref298"></a><a href="#_edn298" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[298]</span></span></a>
Deluded by their ghostly transfigurations, the worldlings create for themselves
a perception of form. The verse in question gives us an insight into this
particular aspect of the drama of existence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A meditator can get at least an
inkling of the emptiness and insubstantiality of this drama of existence, when
he trains himself in keeping the four postures with mindfulness and full
awareness. By practising it, he gets an opportunity to witness a monodrama,
free of charge. And this is the drama: When walking, he understands: 'I am
walking'; when standing, he understands: 'I am standing'; when sitting, he
understands: 'I am sitting'; when lying down, he understands: 'I am lying
down'.<a name="_ednref299"></a><a href="#_edn299" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[299]</span></span></a>
While keeping one's postures in this manner, one sees in outline one's own form
as if one were acting in a monodrama. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When the basis of the factors of
the form group is removed, those in the name group are reduced to purposeless
activations. Earth, water, fire and air constitute the basis of form. When a
meditator becomes dispassionate with regard to these four elements, when they begin
to fade away for him, the factors in the name group assume a ghostly character.
He feels as if he is performing a drama with non-existing objects. He opens a
non-existing door, sits on a non-existing chair, and so on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if we try to understand this in
terms of an analogy of a drama, as we have been doing throughout, we may
compare it to a mime or a dumb show. In a dumb show, one might see such acts as
follows: An actor rides a no-bike, climbs a no-hill, meets a no-friend and has
a no-chat with him. Or else he may sit on a no-chair by a no-table and writes a
no-letter with a no-pen. What we mean by the no-nos here is the fact that on
the stage there is neither a bicycle, nor a hill, nor another person, nor any
other object like a chair, a table or a pen. All these are merely suggested by
his acting. This kind of dumb show has a comic effect on the audience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>An insight meditator, too, goes
through a similar experience when he contemplates on name-and-form, seeing the
four elements as empty and void of essence, which will give him at least an
iota of the conviction that this drama of existence is empty and insubstantial.
He will realize that, as in the case of the dumb show, he is involved with
things that do not really exist. This amounts to an understanding that the
factors of the name group are dependent on the form group, and vice versa. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Seeing the reciprocal relationship
between name-and-form, he is disinclined to dabble in concepts or gulp down a
dose of prescriptions. If form is dependent on name, and name is dependent on
form, both are void of essence. What is essential here, is the very
understanding of essencelessness. If one sits down to draw up lists of concepts
and prescribe them, it would only lead to a mental constipation. Instead of
release there will be entanglement. Such a predicament is not unlikely.</span></p>

mentioned how the fact that name is only a shadow of form is revealed to the

the basis of form as empty. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

attending to his postures, that he is merely enacting a dumb show. He comes to
understand how far name is dependent on form, and the four elements appear to
him as empty. </span></p>

&quot;in whatever way his body is disposed, so he understands it&quot;. This is
suggestive of the attempt of a spectator to understand the mimicry of an actor or
an actress in a pantomime. While attending to one's postures one feels as if
one is watching a one-man dumb show. One gets an opportunity to watch it even
more keenly when one comes to the section on full awareness, <i>sampajaÃ±Ã±apabba</i>,

this relativity one sees the emptiness of both name and form. This same
principle of relativity is implicit in some other statements of the Buddha, but
they are rather neglected for a lack of recognition of their significance. We

In other words, there are no hands, only a taking up and putting down is there.
There are no feet, only a going and coming is there. That way, they might
dogmatically take the bare activity as real and subject it to an analysis. But
what is important here is the understanding of the relativity between the two,
which reveals the emptiness of both. If, on the other hand, one of them is
taken too seriously as real, it ends up in a dogmatic standpoint. It will not

catch a theme is removed. It is due to the perception of permanence that one
grasps a sign in accordance with perceptual data. When one neither takes a sign

deliverances, the signless, the desireless, and the void, that the drama of
existence comes to an end. The perception of impermanence is the main
contributory factor for the cessation of this drama. Some of the discourses of
the Buddha, concerning the destruction of the world, can be cited as object
lessons in the development of the perception of impermanence leading to the
signless deliverance. </span></p>

this world system, which is so full of valuable things like the seven kinds of
jewels, gets fully consumed in a holocaust leaving not even a trace of ash or
soot, as if some ghee or oil has been burned up. The perception of
impermanence, arising out of this description, automatically leads to an
understanding of voidness. </span></p>

the various actors and actresses on the world stage, but all the accompanying
decorations get fully destroyed together with the stage itself at some point of
time grips the mind with sufficient intensity to exhaust the influxes of
sensuality, existence and ignorance, emancipation will occur then and there.

The word <i>abhinivesa </i>is closely associated with the idea of entering into

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Contemporary ascetics of other
sects, notably the <i>brahmins</i>, entertained various views regarding the
origin and purpose of 'all things'. Those who subscribed to a soul theory, had
different answers to questions concerning thing-hood or the essence of a thing.
Presumably it was not easy for the monks, with their not-self standpoint, to
answer those questions to the satisfaction of other sectarians. That is why
those monks confessed their incompetence and begged for guidance. </span></p>

sects to explain away the questions relating to the origin and purpose of
things on the basis of their soul theory or divine creation. Everything came
out of <i>Brahma</i>, and self is the essence of everything. No doubt, such
answers were substantial enough to gain acceptance. Even modern philosophers
are confronted with the intricate problem of determining the exact criterion of
a 'thing'. What precisely accounts for the thing-hood of a thing? What makes it
no-thing? </span></p>

this is a serious underestimation of the import of the entire discourse. It
actually goes far deeper in laying bare a basic principle governing both
skilful and unskilful mental states. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, the first two

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now the <i>sutta</i> in question
has also to be interpreted in the same light, taking into account both these
aspects. It must be mentioned, in particular, that with the passage of time a
certain line of interpretation gained currency, according to which such terms
as <i>chanda </i>were taken as skilful in an exclusive sense. For instance, the
term <i>sati</i>, wherever and whenever it occurred, was taken to refer to <i>samm<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[317]</span></span></a>
Likewise, <i>chanda</i> came to be interpreted as <i>kusalacchanda</i>, desire
or interest in the skilful, or <i>kattukamyat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>chanda</i>,
desire to perform.<a name="_ednref318"></a><a href="#_edn318" title=""><span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But we have to reckon with a
special trait in the Buddha's way of preaching. His sermons were designed to
lead onward the listeners, gradually, according to their degree of
understanding. Sometimes the meaning of a term, as it occurs at the end of a
sermon, is different from the meaning it is supposed to have at the beginning
of the sermon. Such a technique is also evident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The term <i>chanda</i> is one that
has both good and bad connotations. In such contexts as <i>chandar<span

it is suggestive of craving as the cause of all suffering in this world. It
refers to that attachment, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>, which the
world identifies with craving as such. But in the context <i>chanda-iddhip<span

skilful mental state. However, that is not a sufficient reason to regard it as
something alien to the generic sense of the term. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is an important <i>sutta</i>,
which clearly reveals this fact, in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Venerable <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>
replies that the way of practice to be followed for the abandonment of desire
is the above mentioned four bases pertaining to desire, energy, mind and
investigation. The <i>brahmin</i> is puzzled at this reply. He thinks, if that
is so, desire is not abandoned. It is still there. And he raises this objection
to show that there is an implicit contradiction: <i>Chandeneva chanda<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pajahissat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>'ti, neta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vijjati</i>, &quot;that one abandons desire by desire
itself is an impossibility&quot;. Then the Venerable <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda
</i>brings out a simile to convince the <i>brahmin</i> of the implicit truth in
his reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;What do you think, <i>brahmin</i>,
is it not the case that you earlier had the desire 'I will go to the park', and
after you came here, the appropriate desire subsided?&quot; So this is the
logic behind the statement concerning the abandonment of craving. The term <i>chanda</i>
is used here in the first instance with reference to that type of craving for
the purpose of the abandonment of craving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Desire as a basis for success is
developed for the very abandonment of desire. So there is no question about the
use of the same word. Here, <i>chanda</i> as a base of success still belongs to
the <i>chanda</i>-family. A desire should be there even for the abandonment of
desire. This is a distinctive basic principle underlying the middle path. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some have a great liking for the
word <i>chanda</i>, but dislike the word <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. So much so that, if one speaks of a craving for
attaining <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, it might even be
regarded as a blasphemy. In another sermon given by Venerable <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i> himself, one addressed to a particular sick
nun, we find the statement: <i>Ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> niss<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> pah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tabb<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[323]</span></span></a>
&quot;depending on craving one should abandon craving&quot;. That again is
suggestive of a special application of the middle path technique. But the kind
of craving meant here is not something crude. It is specifically explained
there that it is the longing arising in one for the attainment of <i>arahant</i>-hood
on hearing that someone has already attained it. Of course, there is a subtle
trace of craving even in that longing, but it is one that is helpful for the
abandonment of craving. So one need not fight shy of the implications of these
words. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, even the word
<i>rati</i>, attachment, is used with reference to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
When, for instance, it is said that the disciple of the Buddha is attached to
the destruction of craving, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>hakkhayarato
hoti samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sambuddhas<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vako</i>,<a
name="_ednref324"></a><a href="#_edn324" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[324]</span></span></a>
it may sound rather odd, because the word <i>rati</i> usually stands for lust.
However, according to the Middle Path principle of utilizing one thing to
eliminate another, words like <i>chanda</i> and <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> are used with discretion. Sometimes terms like <i>nekkhamasita
domanassa</i>,<a name="_ednref325"></a><a href="#_edn325" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[325]</span></span></a>
unhappiness based on renunciation, are employed to indicate the desire for
attaining<i> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. Therefore the statement <i>chandam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sabbe dhamm<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> need not be interpreted as referring exclusively
to skilful mental states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With regard to the significance of
<i>sati</i> and <i>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, too, we may
mention in passing, that terms like <i>micch<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sati</i>,
wrong mindfulness, and <i>micch<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, wrong concentration, do sometimes occur in the
discourses.<a name="_ednref326"></a><a href="#_edn326" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[326]</span></span></a>
So let us examine whether the set of statements under consideration has any
sequential coherence or depth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Rooted in desire, friends,
are all things.&quot; We might as well bring out the meaning of these
statements with the help of an illustration. Supposing there is a heap of
rubbish and someone approaches it with a basket to collect it and throw it
away. Now, about the rubbish heap, he has just a unitary notion. That is to
say, he takes it as just one heap of rubbish. But as he bends down and starts
collecting it into the basket, he suddenly catches sight of a gem. Now the gem
becomes the object of his desire and interest. A gem arose out of what earlier
appeared as a rubbish heap. It became the thing for him, and desire was at the
root of this phenomenon - true to the dictum &quot;rooted in desire, friends,
are all things&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then what about origination
through attention? It is through attention that the gem came into being. One
might think that the origin of the gem should be traced to the mine or to some
place where it took shape, but the Buddha traces its origin in accordance with
the norm <i>manopubba<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;mind is the forerunner of all
things&quot;. So then, the root is desire and the source of origin is
attention, the very fact of attending. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Phassasamuday<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></span></i><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>, &quot;all things arise from
contact&quot;. There was eye-contact with the gem as something special out of
all the things in the rubbish heap. So the gem 'arose' from eye-contact. <i>Vedan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>samosara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span> sabbe
dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;all things converge on
feeling&quot;. As soon as the eye spotted the gem, a lot of pleasant feelings
about it arose in the mind. Therefore, all things converge on feeling. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhipamukh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>,
&quot;headed by concentration are all things&quot;. Here, in this case, it may
be wrong concentration, <i>micch<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, but all the same it is some kind of
concentration. It is now a concentration on the gem. It is as if his meditation
has shifted from the rubbish heap to the gem. <i>Sat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhipateyy<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i> </i>&quot;dominated
by mindfulness are all things&quot;. As to this dominance, undistracted
attention is necessary for the maintenance of that thing which has now been
singled out. Where there is distraction, attention is drawn to other things as
well. That is why mindfulness is said to be dominant. Be it the so-called wrong
mindfulness, but nonetheless, it is now directed towards the gem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now comes the decisive stage, that
is, the 'surmountability by wisdom', <i>paÃ±Ã±uttar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
Let us for a moment grant that somehow or other, even though wrongly, <i>micch<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, some kind of surrogate mindfulness and
concentration has developed out of this situation. Now, if one wants to cross
over in accordance with the <i>Dhamma</i>, that is, if one wants to attain <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> with this gem itself as the topic of meditation,
one has to follow the hint given by the statement <i>paÃ±Ã±uttar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;surmountable by wisdom are
all things&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What one has to do now is to see
through the gem, to penetrate it, by viewing it as impermanent, fraught with
suffering, and not-self, thereby arriving at the conviction that, after all,
the gem belongs to the rubbish heap itself. The gem is transcended by the
wisdom that it is just one item in this rubbish heap that is 'The world' in its
entirety. If one wins to the wisdom that this gem is something like a piece of
charcoal, to be destroyed in the holocaust at the end of a world period, one
has transcended that gem. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then, the essence of all things
is not any self or soul, as postulated by the <i>brahmins</i>. Deliverance is
the essence. In such discourses as the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ropamasutta</i>, the essence of this entire <i>Dhamma</i>
is said to be deliverance.<a name="_ednref327"></a><a href="#_edn327" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[327]</span></span></a>
The very emancipation from all this, to be rid of all this, is itself the
essence. Some seem to think that the essence is a heaping up of concepts and clinging
to them. But that is not the essence of this teaching. It is the ability to
penetrate all concepts, thereby transcending them. The deliverance resulting
from transcendence is itself the essence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With the cessation of that concept
of a gem as some special thing, a valuable thing, separate from the rest of the
world, as well as of the ensuing heap of concepts by way of craving, conceit
and views, the gem ceases to exist. That itself is the deliverance. It is the
emancipation from the gem. Therefore,<i> vimuttis<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
&quot;deliverance is the essence of all things&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then, we have here a very
valuable discourse which can even be used as a topic of insight meditation. The
essence of any mind object is the very emancipation from it, by seeing it with
wisdom. Considered in this light, everything in the world is a meditation
object. That is why we find very strange meditation topics mentioned in
connection with the attainments of ancient <i>arahant </i>monks and nuns.
Sometimes, even apparently unsuitable meditation objects have been successfully
employed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Meditation teachers, as a rule, do
not approve of certain meditation objects for beginners, with good reasons. For
instance, they would not recommend a female form as a meditation object for a
male, and a male form for a female. That is because it can arouse lust, since
it is mentioned in the <i>Therag<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>th<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>that lust arose in some monk even on seeing a
decayed female corpse in a cemetery.<a name="_ednref328"></a><a href="#_edn328"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[328]</span></span></a>
But in the same text one comes across an episode in connection with Venerable <i>N<span

in utter contrast to it. </span></p>

The usual interpretation is that it is due to the miraculous powers of the
Buddha, or else that the persons concerned had an extraordinary stock of merit.
The miracle of the <i>Dhamma</i>, implicit in such occurrences, is often
ignored. </span></p>

we may take the case of someone keen on seeing a rainbow. He will have to go on
looking at the sky indefinitely, waiting for a rainbow to appear. But if he is
wise enough, he can see the spectrum of rainbow colours through a dewdrop
hanging on a leaf of a creeper waving in the morning sun, provided he finds the
correct perspective. For him, the dewdrop itself is the meditation object. In
the same way, one can sometimes see the entire <i>Dhamma</i>, thirty-seven
factors of enlightenment and the like, even in a potentially pernicious
meditation object. </span></p>

attention, and <i>ayoniso manasik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
non-radical attention, are in utter contrast to each other. There is a world of
difference between them. So also between the terms <i>samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, right view, and <i>micch<span

the sun's rays in the dewdrop disappears with a very little shift in one's
perspective. It appears only when viewed in a particular perspective. What we
find in this <i>Dhamma</i> is something similar. This is the intrinsic nature
of this <i>Dhamma</i> that is to be seen here and now, timeless, leading

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some noteworthy points emerge from
this catechism. All concepts and thoughts have name-and-form as their object.
The eighteen elements account for their diversity. They arise with contact.
They converge on feeling. They are headed by concentration. They are dominated
by mindfulness. Their acme or point of transcendence is wisdom. Their essence
is deliverance and they get merged in the deathless. Be it noted that the
deathless is a term for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. Therefore,
as we have stated above, everything has the potentiality to yield the
deathless, provided radical attention is ushered in. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is indubitably clear, from this
catechism, that the subject under consideration is concepts and thoughts. All
mind objects partake of the character of concepts and thoughts. Therefore the
mind objects, according to the Buddha, have to be evaluated on the lines of the
above mentioned normative principles, and not on the lines of self essence and
divine creation as postulated by soul theories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the course of training advocated by the Buddha, which begins with name-and-form
as object, reaches its consummation in seeing through name-and-form, that is,
in its penetration. It culminates in the transcendence of name-and-form, by
penetrating into its impermanent, suffering-fraught, and not-self nature. This
fact is borne out by the discourses already quoted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The essence of the teaching is
release from name-and-form. When one rightly understands the relation between
name and form as well as their emptiness, one is able to see through
name-and-form. This penetration is the function of wisdom. So long as wisdom is
lacking, consciousness has a tendency to get entangled in name-and-form. This

The film show lost its lustre when the doors were flung open. The narrow beam

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>Brahmaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lasutta</i>
itself we find some views advanced by those who had higher knowledges. With the
help of those higher knowledges, which were still of the mundane type, they
would see into their past, sometimes hundreds of thousands of their past lives,
and drawing also from their ability to read others' minds, they would construct
various views. Many such views are recorded in the <i>Brahmaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lasutta</i>,
only to be rejected and invalidated. Why so? The reason is given here in this
verse. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

closed room with tinted window panes sees only what is reflected on those dark
panes, and not beyond, even so, those 'seers' got enmeshed in name-and-form
when they proceeded to speculate on what they saw as their past lives. They
took name-and-form itself to be real. That is why the Buddha declared that
whether they saw much or little, it is of no use, since experts do not
attribute purity to that kind of vision, <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma<span

narrow wrong views are based on name-and-form, assuming it to be something
real. The Buddha's vision, on the other hand, is one that transcends
name-and-form. It is a supramundane vision. This fact is clearly revealed by
the implications of the very title of the <i>Brahmaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lasutta</i>.
At the end of the discourse, the Buddha himself compares it to an all-embracing
super-net.<a name="_ednref339"></a><a href="#_edn339" title=""><span

Just as a clever fisherman would throw a finely woven net well over a small
lake, so that all the creatures living there are caught in it as they come up,
all the possible views in the world are enmeshed or forestalled by this

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now pause to consider what
the mesh of this net could be. If the <i>Brahmaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lasutta</i>
is a net, what constitutes that fine mesh in this net? There is a word occurring
all over the discourse, which gives us a clear answer to this question. It is
found in the phrase which the Buddha uses to disqualify every one of those
views, namely, <i>tadapi phassapaccay<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,<i>

all-encompassing lustre of wisdom, born of the cessation of the six
sense-bases, which in effect, is the vision of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
This fact is further clarified in the <i>sutta</i> by the statement of the
Buddha that those who cling to those wrong views, based on name-and-form, keep

&quot;They all continue to experience feeling coming into contact again and
again with the six sense-bases, and to them dependent on contact there is
feeling, dependent on feeling there is craving, dependent on craving there is
grasping, dependent on grasping there is becoming, dependent on becoming there
is birth, and dependent on birth, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair come to be. But when, monks, a monk knows, as they truly are,
the arising, the going down, the satisfaction, the peril and the stepping out

the distinction between those who held on to such speculative views and the one
who wins to the vision made known by the Buddha. The former were dependent on

feeling. Because of feeling they are lured into craving and grasping which make
them go round and round in<i> sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the right path, on the other hand, wins to that synoptic vision of the six

wisdom. To him, all five aspects of the six sense-bases become clear, namely
the arising, the going down, the satisfaction, the peril and the stepping out.
That light of wisdom is considered the highest knowledge, precisely because it
reveals all these five aspects of the six sense-bases. </span></p>

&quot;And what, monks, is consciousness? There are these six classes of
consciousness - eye- consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness,
tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness; this, monks,
is called consciousness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This shows that the consciousness
mentioned in the formula of dependent arising is not something like a
re-linking consciousness. The reference here is not to just one consciousness.
It is in dependence on name-and-form, reflected on all six types of
consciousness, that the six sense-bases get established. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The discrimination between an
'internal' and an 'external' is the outcome of the inability to penetrate
name-and-form, to see through it. There is an apparent duality: I, as one who
sees, and name-and-form, as the objects seen. Between them there is a dichotomy
as internal and external. It is on this very dichotomy that the six sense-bases
are 'based'. Feeling and all the rest of it come on top of those six
sense-bases. Craving and grasping follow suit, as a result of which those
dogmatists get caught up in the vicious cycle of dependent arising and keep
running round in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>
as the Buddha has declared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then, it becomes clear from the
<i>Brahmaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lasutta</i> that such a wide variety of
wrong views exist in this world due to the dogmatic involvement in
name-and-form reflected on consciousness, that is by mis-taking the reflection
to be one's self. This, in brief, is tantamount to <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, or personality view. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us take up a parable by
way of an illustration of the distinction between the wrong view of the
dogmatists, already analysed, and the right view, which is in complete contrast
to it. It is an episode in the <i>Ummaggaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taka</i>
which more or less looks like a parable to illustrate this point.<a
name="_ednref343"></a><a href="#_edn343" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[343]</span></span></a>
In the <i>Ummaggaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taka</i> one comes across the
problem of a gem. In that story there are in fact several such problems
concerning gems, and we are taking up just one of them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The citizens of <i>Mithil<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> came and informed king <i>Videha</i> that there is
a gem in the pond near the city gate. The king commissioned his royal adviser <i>Senaka</i>
with the task of taking out the gem. He went and got the people to empty the
pond but failed to find the gem there. Even the mud was taken out and the earth
dug up in a vain attempt to locate the gem. When he confessed his failure to
the king, the latter entrusted the job to <i>bodhisatta Mahosadha</i>, the
youngest adviser. When he went there and had a look around, he immediately
understood that the gem is actually in a crow's nest on a palm tree near the
pond. What appeared in the pond is only its reflection. He convinced the king
of this fact by getting a man to immerse a bowl of water into the pond, which
also reflected the gem. Then the man climbed up the palm tree and found the gem
there, as predicted by <i>Mahosadha</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If we take this episode as an
illustration, the view of the dogmatists can be compared to <i>Senaka's</i>
view. The discovery of the Buddha that name-and-form is a mere reflection is
like the solution advanced by <i>bodhisatta Mahosadha</i> to the problem of the
gem in the pond. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now what is the role of
personality view in this connection? It is said that the Buddha preached the <i>Dhamma</i>
adopting a via media between two extreme views. What are they? The eternalist
view and the nihilist view. The eternalist view is like that attachment to the
reflection. Sometimes, when one sees one's own image in water, one falls in
love with it, imagining it to be someone else, as in the case of the dog on the
plank mentioned in an earlier sermon.<a name="_ednref344"></a><a href="#_edn344"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[344]</span></span></a>
It can sometimes arouse hate as well. Thus there could be both self-love and
self-hate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Inclining towards these two
attitudes, the personality view itself leads to the two extreme views known as
eternalism and nihilism, or annihilationism. It is like <i>Senaka's</i> attempt
to find the gem by emptying the water and digging the bottom of the pond. The
Buddha avoids both these extremes by understanding that this name-and-form is a
reflection, owing to the reflective nature of this pond of consciousness. It
has no essence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The name in this name-and-form, as
we have already stated in an earlier sermon, is merely a formal name, or an
apparent name.<a name="_ednref345"></a><a href="#_edn345" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[345]</span></span></a>
And the form here is only a nominal form, a form only in name. There is neither
an actual name nor a substantial form here. Name is only apparent, and form is
only nominal. With this preliminary understanding one has to arouse that wisdom
by building up the ability to see through name-and-form, in order to win to
freedom from this name-and-form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So, in this sermon, our special
attention has been on name-and-form, on the interrelation between name-and-form
and consciousness. All this reveals to us the importance of the first two lines
of the problematic verse already quoted, <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span

sides&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the Buddha's vision,
by fully comprehending the fact that name-and-form is a mere image, or
reflection, the non-manifestative consciousness develops the penetrative power
to see through it. But those others, who could not understand that it is a
reflection, aroused self-love and self-hate. It is as if one is trying to
outstrip one's shadow by running towards it out of fun, while the other is
trying to flee from it out of fear. Such is the nature of the two extreme views
in this world. </span></p>

series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.<i> </i>With
the help of a parable based on the problem of the gem in the <i>Ummaggaj<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taka</i>, we made an attempt, towards the end of our
last sermon, to clarify to some extent how the personality view arises due to
the ignorance of the fact that name-and-form is something reflected on
consciousness. We mentioned in brief how a certain would-be wise man took the
trouble to empty a pond and even dig out the mud under the impression that
there is actually a gem in it, simply because there appeared to be a gem in the
pond. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Similarly, by taking to be real
name-and-form, which is only an image reflected on consciousness leading to a
personality view, <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>,
both eternalism and nihilism, built on the two views of existence and
non-existence, tended towards two extremes. Under the influence of self love,
eternalism took up the view that there is a self, and looked forward to its
perpetuation. Prompted by self hate, annihilationism or nihilism cherished the
fond hope that the release from this self will occur at death. Both these
extreme views confuse the issue by not understanding the reflected image as
such. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now how did the middle path, which
the Buddha introduced to the world, avoid these two extremes? It is by offering

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now it is extremely clear, even
from the quotation as it stands, that the Buddha has interposed this word <i>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta</i> between the dichotomous terms <i>bhava</i> and <i>vibhava</i>.
In the contemporary society, these two terms were used to denote the existence
and the destruction of a soul. This usage is clearly revealed by some
discourses, in which those who held on to similar views expressed them in such
terms as <i>bhaviss<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi </i>and <i>na bhaviss<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi</i>.<a name="_ednref350"></a><a href="#_edn350"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[350]</span></span></a>
These expressions, meaning 'I will be' and 'I will not be', carry with them an
implication of a person or a self. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The term <i>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta</i>,
on the other hand, is not amenable to such a usage. It has the passive sense of
something that has become. Like that reflection mentioned earlier, it conveys
the idea of being produced by causes and conditions. Going by the analogy of
the reflected image mentioned above, the eternalist, because of his
narcissistic selflove, gets attached to his own self image and lags behind.
When the Buddha preaches the <i>Dhamma</i> for the cessation of existence, he
shrinks from fear that it would lead to the destruction of his self. It is like
the narcissistic attempt to embrace one's own image in water out of self love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The annihilationist view leads to an
attitude of escapism, like that of one who is obsessed by his own shadow. One
cannot outstrip one's own shadow. It is only a vain attempt. So also is the
fond hope of the nihilist that by simply negating self one can be free from
repeated birth. It turns out to be mere wishful thinking, because simply by
virtue of the view 'I shall not be after death' one cannot win deliverance, so
long as such defilements like ignorance and craving are there. These were the
two extremes towards which those two dogmatic views of eternalism and
annihilationism tended. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By introducing the term <i>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta</i> the Buddha made it known that the five groups
are the product of causes and conditions, that they are conditionally arisen.
In the <i>Itivuttaka</i>, for instance, one comes across the following
significant lines: <i>J<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> samuppanna<span

name="_ednref351"></a><a href="#_edn351" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[351]</span></span></a>
The reference here is to the five groups of grasping. They are
&quot;born&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, &quot;arisen&quot; (that is conditionally
arisen), &quot;made up&quot;, &quot;prepared&quot;, and &quot;unstable&quot;.
These words are suggestive of some artificiality. The word <i>addhuva<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>brings out their impermanence and
insubstantiality. There is no eternal essence, like <i>sat</i>, or being. It is
merely a self image, a reflection. So it seems that the word <i>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta</i> has connotations of being a product of causes
and conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Therefore, in spite of the scare
it has aroused in the soul-theorists, <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
is not something that destroys a truly existing entity. Though <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is called <i>bhavanirodha</i>,<a
name="_ednref352"></a><a href="#_edn352" title=""><span

cessation of existence, according to the outlook of the Buddha the worldlings
have merely a craving for existence, <i>bhavata<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, and not a real existence. It is only a conceit of
existence, the conceit 'am', <i>asmim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In reality it amounts to a
craving, and this is the significance of the term <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ponobh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, craving which makes for re-becoming. Because of
that craving, which is always bent forward, worldlings keep running round in <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. But on analysis
a concrete situation always reveals a state of a become, a <i>bh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta</i>, as something produced by causes and conditions.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A donkey drags a wagon when a
carrot is projected towards it from the wagon. The journey of beings in <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> is something
like that. So what we have here is not the destruction of some existing essence
of being or a soul. From the point of view of the <i>Dhamma</i> the cessation
of existence, or <i>bhavanirodha</i>, amounts to a stopping of the process of
becoming, by the removal of the causes leading to it, namely ignorance and
craving. It is, in effect, the cessation of suffering itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Those who held on to the
annihilationist view, entertained the hope that their view itself entitled them
to their cherished goal. But it was in vain, because the ignorance, craving,
and grasping within them created for them the five groups of grasping, or this
mass of suffering, again and again despite their view,<i> uppajjati dukkham ida<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> punappuna<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So what we have here is a deep
philosophy of things as they are, which follows a certain law of causality. The
Buddha's middle path is based on this knowledge and vision of things as they
are, avoiding both extremes of self indulgence and self mortification. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now consider the question
of existence involved in this context. The terms <i>bhava </i>and <i>vibhava</i>

upholders of dogmatic views brought up such propositions as 'everything exists',
<i>sabba<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> atthi</i>, and 'nothing exists', <i>sabba<span

or 'am', is more basic than the usage of 'is' and 'is not'. The most elementary
concept is <i>asmi</i>, or 'am'. Hence the term <i>asmim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
the conceit 'am'. In the grammatical structure, the pride of place should be
given to <i>asmi</i>, or 'am'. We sometimes tend to regard <i>atthi</i>, or
'is', as the primary term. But <i>asmi</i> deserves pride of place in so far as
it is the basic element in the grammatical structure. It is like the central
peg from which all measurings and surveyings of the world start, since the word
<i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> in <i>asmim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
also means 'measuring'. Given <i>asmi</i>, or 'am', everything else comes to
be. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us take an illustration. If,
for instance, we say &quot;there is something&quot;, someone will pose the
question &quot;where is it?&quot; It should be either here or there or yonder, that
is, over there. It can be in one of those three places. Now, if it is here, how
does that place become a 'here'? That is where I am. 'There' is where he is,
and 'yonder' is where you are. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So we have here the framework of
the grammar. Here is the basic lining up for the formation of the grammatical
structure, its most elementary pattern. So, then, 'I am', 'you are', and 'he
is'. In this way we see that one can speak of the existence of something
relative to a viewpoint represented by 'am' or 'I am'. That is why the Buddha
rejected as extremes the two views of absolute existence and absolute
non-existence, based on 'is', <i>atthi</i>, and 'is not', <i>natthi</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Only when there is an 'I', can
something exist relative to that I. And that something, if it is 'there', it is
where 'I' am not present, or at a distance from me. If it is 'yonder', or over
there, it is before you who are in front of me. And if it is 'here', it is
beside me. From this we can see that this conceit 'am' is, as it were, the
origin of the whole world, the origin of the world of grammar. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On a previous occasion, too, while
discussing the significance of the two terms <i>itthabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va
</i>and <i>aÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va</i>,
we had to make a similar statement.<a name="_ednref354"></a><a href="#_edn354"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[354]</span></span></a>
The Buddha draws our attention to a very important fact in this concern,
namely, the fact that the conceit 'am' does not arise without causes and
conditions. It is not something uncaused, and unconditioned. If it is uncaused
and unconditioned, it can never be made to cease. The notion 'am' arises due to
certain causes and conditions. There is a word suggestive of this causal
origin, namely <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, we use the term
<i>paÃ±c'up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nakkhandha</i>.<i>
</i>When we speak of the five groups of grasping, the word <i>up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> (<i>upa + <span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> + d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>) is often
rendered by grasping. The prefix <i>upa</i> is supposed to imply the tenacity
of the hold.<a name="_ednref355"></a><a href="#_edn355" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[355]</span></span></a>
One can therefore ask whether it is not sufficient to relax the hold on the
five groups. Strictly speaking, the prefix <i>upa</i> in <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> conveys the sense of proximity or nearness.
Sometimes the two words <i>upeti </i>and <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>diyati</i>
are found in juxtaposition. <i>Upeti</i>, <i>upa + i</i>, to go, means 'coming
near' or 'approaching', and <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>diyati</i> has
the sense of 'holding on to', having come close. In other words, we have here
not only a case of holding, but of holding 'on to'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the totality of existence, from
the point of view of <i>Dhamma</i>, is dependent on a holding on, or a grasping
on. It is not something uncaused and unconditioned. Here we may remind
ourselves of the simile of the winding of a rope or a cord which we brought up
in a previous sermon.<a name="_ednref356"></a><a href="#_edn356" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[356]</span></span></a>
We cannot help going back to the same simile again and again, if we are to
deepen our understanding of the <i>Dhamma</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In that illustration we spoke of
two persons winding up several strands to make a rope or a cord. But both are
winding in the same direction from either end. Such an attempt at winding,
however long it is continued, does not result in an actual winding, for the
simple reason that the winding from one end is continually being unwinded from
the other end. But what happens if a third person catches hold of the rope in
the middle? Due to that hold on the middle, something like a rope appears to
get winded up. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now existence, too, is something
similar. It is because of the hold in the middle that the rope gets wound up.
From the point of view of an outsider, the one in the middle is holding on to a
rope. But the truth is, that the semblance of a rope is there due to that
holding on itself. This, then, is the norm of this world. 'Whatever is of a
nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease, <i>ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

every winding ends up in an unwinding. But because of that hold in the middle,
the windings get accumulated. Just because of his hold in the middle, his hand

also due to a grasping or a holding on to, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span

illustration merely for the sake of a simile. We can adduce reasons for its
validity even from the discourses. This word <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span

shown, <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
does not simply mean grasping, or grasping rigidly, but holding on to
something, having come close to it. This holding on creates a certain
relationship, which may be technically termed a relativity. The two stand
relative to each other. For instance, that rope exists relative to the grasping
of the person who holds on to it. Now <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now try to get at the
meaning of this important passage, which should clarify further what we have
already attempted to explain through similes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;It is with dependence,
friend <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>, that the notion 'am' occurs,
not without dependence. With dependence on what, does the notion 'am' occur,
and not without dependence? With dependence on form does the notion 'am' occur,
not without dependence; with dependence on feeling does the notion 'am' occur,
not without dependence; with dependence on perception does the notion 'am'
occur, not without dependence; with dependence on preparations does the notion
'am' occur, not without dependence; with dependence on consciousness does the
notion 'am' occur, not without dependence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Just as, friend <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>, a woman or a man, youthful and fond of
adornment, in looking at her or his facial image in a mirror or in a bowl
filled with pure, clear, clean water, would be seeing it with dependence and
not without dependence, even so, friend <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>,
it is with dependence that the notion 'am' occurs, not without
dependence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact, it is rather difficult to
render the word <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
It means 'in dependence on' something and has a relative sense. Reinforced with
the emphatic double negative, the assertion seems to imply that the notion 'am'
is something dependent and not independent, that it arises due to causes and
conditions. In the explanation that follows, this dictum is substantiated by
bringing in the five groups or aggregates, relative to which one posits an
'am'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The subsequent illustration serves
to bring out the required nuance of the term <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, which is more often connected with the rather
gross idea of grasping. The young woman or the young man is looking at her or
his face in a mirror. They can see their own face, or the sign of it, <i>mukhanimitta</i>,
only with the help of a mirror, that is, as an image reflected on it. They are
dependent on a mirror or a similar object for seeing their own face, not
independent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What Venerable <i>Pu<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a Mant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>iputta</i>
seems to stress, is that the notion 'am' is the result of grasping or holding
on to form, feeling, perception, preparations, and consciousness. It is when
one looks into a mirror that one suddenly becomes self-conscious. Whether one
has a liking or a dislike for what one sees, one gets the notion 'this is me'.
So it is by coming close to a mirror which reflects one's facial image that the
notion 'am' occurs depending on it. The word <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> therefore approximates to the idea of coming
close and holding on to. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That notion occurs due to a
relationship arising from that holding on. Even if one already has no such
notion, the moment one looks into a mirror one is suddenly reminded of it, as
if to exclaim: &quot;Ah, here I am!&quot; This is the gist of what Venerable <i>Pu<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a Mant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>iputta
</i>is trying to put across through this discourse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This shows that the conceit 'am'
arises due to the five grasping groups. The absolutive <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, though akin to <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, has a deeper significance. It is a word
suggestive of a relationship. It does not merely mean a holding on, but also a
certain necessary relationship arising out of that holding on. Just as the
looking into a mirror or a bowl of water gives rise to a facial image as a
reflection, here too the relationship calls forth the deluded reflection
&quot;here I am&quot;. Given the notion &quot;here I am&quot;, there follows
the corollary &quot;things that are mine&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So there is supposed to be an 'I'
in contradistinction to things that are 'mine'. It is the difficulty to
demarcate the area of applicability between these two concepts that has given
rise to insoluble problems. 'Who am I and what is mine?' The twenty modes of
personality view, <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now see how the twenty
modes of personality view are made up. For instance, as regards form, it is
fourfold as follows: <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
attato samanupassati, r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pavanta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

&quot;He regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self,
or self as in form.&quot; It is the same with the other four groups. In this
way, the personality view is altogether twenty-fold. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this comes about due to the
ignorance that name-and-form is only a reflection, like that facial image. In
grasping this self image of name-and-form one grasps the five groups.
Attachment to name-and-form amounts to a holding on to these five groups. To
many, the relationship between name-and-form and the grasping groups appears as
a big puzzle. Wherever one looks, one sees this self image of name-and-form.
But when one grasps it, what comes within the grasp is a group of form,
feeling, perception, preparations, and consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The magical illusion created by
consciousness is so complete that it is capable of playing a dual role, as in
double acting. Because it reflects, like a mirror, consciousness itself is
grasped, just as one grasps the mirror. Not only the reflection of the mirror,
but the mirror itself is grasped. The grasping group of consciousness
represents such a predicament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>One can form an idea about the
relation between name-and-form and consciousness by going deeper into the
implications of this discourse. In the discussion of the interrelation between

and <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ighasamphassa.</i> How contact arises

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this may well appear like a
riddle, but then let us consider what name-and-form means, to begin with. The
definition we gave to <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma </i>in our very
first sermon happened to be different from the well known definition nowadays
given in terms of a bending.<a name="_ednref361"></a><a href="#_edn361" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[361]</span></span></a>
We interpreted <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma </i>in the sense of a
'naming'. Now this term <i>adhivacana </i>also conveys the same idea. <i>Adhivacana</i>,<i>
</i>synonym, <i>nirutti</i>, nomenclature, and <i>paÃ±Ã±atti</i>, designation, are
part and parcel of linguistic usage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>Niruttipathasutta</i> of
the <i>Khandhasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i> one comes across three
terms, <i>niruttipatha, adhivacanapatha, </i>and <i>paÃ±Ã±attipatha</i>, pathways
of nomenclature, pathways of synonyms, pathways of designation.<a
name="_ednref362"></a><a href="#_edn362" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[362]</span></span></a>
There three terms are closely allied in meaning, in that they bring out in
sharp relief three aspects of linguistic usage. <i>Nirutti</i> emphasises the
explanatory or expository function of language, <i>adhivacana</i> its symbolic
and metaphorical character, while <i>paÃ±Ã±atti</i> brings out its dependence on
convention. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What we have here is <i>adhivacanasamphassa</i>.
Its affinity to name is obvious, and this is precisely the meaning we
attributed to <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i>. Therefore, what we have
in this concept of <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>,
or name-group, literally 'name-body', is a set of first principles in
linguistic usage pertaining to definition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The form-group, or <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, literally
'form-body', on the other hand has something to do with resistance, as
suggested by the term <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ighasamphassa</i>. <i>Pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>igha</i> means 'striking against'. Form, or <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa,</i> has a striking quality, while name, or <i>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma,</i> has a descriptive quality. <i>Phassa</i>, or
contact, is a hybrid of these two. This is what gives a deeper dimension to the
above disquisition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The point that the Buddha seeks to
drive home is the fact that the concept of contact necessarily presupposes both
name and form. In other words, name and form are mutually interrelated, as
already stated above. There would be no verbal impression in the form-group, if
there were no modes, characteristics, etc., proper to name. Likewise there
could be no resistant impression in the name-group, if there were no modes,
characteristics, etc., proper to form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At first sight these two may
appear as totally opposed to each other. But what is implied is a case of
mutual interrelation. The expression peculiar to the name-group is a necessary
condition for the form-group, while the resistance peculiar to the form-group
is a necessary condition for the name-group. Since here we have something deep,
let us go for an illustration for the sake of clarity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we have already stated, a
verbal impression in regard to the form-group is there because of the
constituents of the name-group. Now the form-group consists of the four great primaries
earth, water, fire and air. Even to distinguish between them by their qualities
of hardness and softness, hotness and coolness, etc., feeling, perception,
intention, contact and attention, which are the constituents of the name-group,
have to play their part. Thus it is with the help of those members on the name
side that the four basic elements associated with form receive recognition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Metaphor is a figure of speech,
common in ornate literary language as well as in technical terminology. Here
the inanimate is animated by personification. What is proper to the animate
world is superimposed on the inanimate. Now the word <i>adhivacana</i> is, even
literally, a superimposition, and it is a term with obvious metaphorical
associations. Whereas in the literary field it has an ornate value as a
figurative expression, in technical usage it serves the purpose of facility of
expression by getting the tools to speak for themselves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, a carpenter might
speak of two planks touching each other as if they can actually touch and feel.
The concept of touch, even when it is attributed to inanimate objects, is the
outcome of attention, in this case the attention of the carpenter. Here, again,
we are reminded of the role of attention in the origination of things as stated
in the <i>Ki<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lakasutta</i><span

name="_ednref364"></a><a href="#_edn364" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[364]</span></span></a>
&quot;All things are rooted in interest, they originate with attention and
arise out of contact&quot;, <i>chandam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lak<span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[365]</span></span></a>
Wherever the carpenter's interest went, his attention discovered and picked up
the thing, and here the thing is the fact of two planks touching each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Interest, attention and contact
together bring out some deeper implications of the law of dependent arising.
Not only with regard to inanimate objects, but even in the case of this
conscious body, the question of contact is related to the fact of attention. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If, for instance I ask what I am
touching now, one might say that I am touching the palm leaf fan in my hand.
This is because we usually associate the idea of touching with the hand that
holds. But suppose I put away the fan and ask again what I am touching now, one
might find it difficult to answer. It might not be possible for another to
guess by mere external observation, since it is essentially subjective. It is
dependent on my attention. It could even be my robe that I am touching in the
sense of contact, in which case I am becoming conscious of my body as apart
from the robe I am wearing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Consciousness follows in the wake
of attention. Whatever my attention picks up, of that I am conscious. Though I
have in front of me so many apparently visible objects, until my attention is
focussed, eye-consciousness does not come about. The basic function of this
type of consciousness, then, is to distinguish between the eye and the object
seen. It is only after the eye has become conscious, that other factors
necessary for sense perception fall into place. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The two things born of that basic
discrimination, together with the discriminating consciousness itself, that is
eye-consciousness, make up the concept of contact. <i>CakkhuÃ±ca pa<span

forms, eye-consciousness arises, the concurrence of the three is contact.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The same principle holds good in
the case of the two planks touching each other. All this goes to show that it
is with the help of the factors in the name-group that we can even
metaphorically speak of a contact between inanimate things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now consider how
resistance-impression, <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ighasamphassa</i>,
comes about. It is said that the factors of the form-group have a part to play
in producing resistance-impression on the name-group. We sometimes speak of an
idea 'striking us', as if it were something material. Or else an idea could be
'at the back' of our mind and a word 'on the tip' of our tongue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The clearest manifestation of
contact is that between material objects, where collision is suggestive of
resistance, as implied by the word <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>igha</i>.
This primary sense of striking against or striking together is implicit even in
the simile given by the Buddha in the <i>Dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tuvibha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta</i> of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>,

contact is primarily associated with the form-group, it is essentially connected

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Another point that needs to be
clarified in this connection is the exact significance of the word <i>r<span

explained among different Buddhist sects. How did the Buddha define <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>? In ordinary usage it can mean either forms

<i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>? It is affected, monks, that is why it
is called <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>. Affected by what? Affected
by cold, affected by heat, affected by hunger, affected by thirst, affected by
contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun and serpents. It is affected,
monks, that is why it is called <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This definition seems to convey
something very deep, so much so that various Buddhist sects came out with
various interpretations of this passage. The Buddha departs from the way of
approach taken up by the materialistic systems of thought in the world in
defining <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i> with <i>ruppati</i>,<i> </i>'being
affected'. It is not the inanimate trees and rocks in the world that are said
to be affected by cold and heat, but this conscious body. So this body is not
conceived of as a bundle of atoms to be animated by introducing into it a life
faculty, <i>j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>vitindriya</i>. What is meant by <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>is this same body, this body with form, which,
for the meditator, is a fact of experience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Attempts at interpretation from a
scholastic point of view created a lot of complications. But the definition, as
it stands, is clear enough. It is directly addressed to experience. The purpose
of the entire <i>Dhamma</i> preached by the Buddha is not to encourage an
academic dabbling in philosophical subtleties with a mere jumble of words. The
purpose is utter disenchantment, dispassion and cessation, <i>ekantanibbid<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya, vir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>g<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya,

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[369]</span></span></a> Therefore the etymology given
here in terms of <i>ruppati</i>, 'to be affected', is in full accord with that
purpose. <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i> is so called, because it is
affected by cold, heat, and the sting of gadflies, mosquitoes, etc., not
because of any atomism in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If we are to examine further the
meaning of this verb <i>ruppati</i>, we can count on the following quotation
from the <i>Pi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>giyasutta </i>of the <i>P<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yanavagga</i> in the <i>Sutta
Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>. It runs: <i>ruppanti r<span

&quot;heedless men are affected in regard to forms&quot;. The canonical
commentary <i>C<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;&#7735;</span>aniddesa</i>,<i> </i>commenting
on the word, brings out the various nuances connected with it. <i>Ruppant<span

&quot;<i>Ruppanti</i> means to be adversely affected, to be afflicted, to come
into contact with, to be dis-eased and dis-pleased.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Surely it is not the trees and
rocks that are affected in this manner. It is this animate body that is subject
to all this. The pragmatic purpose of utter detachment, dispassion and
cessation is clear enough even from this commentary. What is known as the
form-group, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pakkhandha</i>, is one vast wound
with nine apertures.<a name="_ednref372"></a><a href="#_edn372" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[372]</span></span></a>
This wound is affected when it is touched by cold and heat, when gadflies and
mosquitoes land on it. This wound gets irritated by them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We come across yet another
canonical reference in support of these nuances in the following two lines in
the <i>U<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>
of the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>. <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>tur<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These two lines stress the need
for heedfulness for beings pierced with the arrow of craving. Here, too, the
verb <i>ruppati</i> has the sense of being affected or afflicted. All this goes
to show that the early Buddhist concept of <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>
had a striking simplicity about it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we have already stated at the
very outset, the teachings in the discourses are simple enough. But there is a
certain depth in this very simplicity, for it is only when the water is lucid
and limpid that one can see the bottom of a pond. But with the passage of time
there was a tendency to lose interest in these discourses, because of the
general predilection for complexity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Materialistic philosophers, in
particular, were carried away by this trend, whether they were Hindus or Buddhists.
Modern day scientists, too, got caught in this trend. They pursued the
materialistic overtones of the word <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>,
without realizing that they are running after a mirage. They went on analysing
matter, until they ended up with an atomism and grasped a heap of concepts. The
analysis of matter thus precipitated a grasping of a mass of concepts. Whether
one grasps a pole or a mole, it is a grasping all the same. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha's admonitions, on the contrary,
point in a different direction. He pointed out that in order to be free from
the burdensome oppression of form, one has to be free from the perception of
form. What is of relevance here is the very perception of form, <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. From the
point of view of <i>Dhamma</i>, any attempt at analysis of the materialistic
concept of form, or any microscopic analysis of matter, would lead to a pursuit
of a mirage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This fact, the modern day
scientist is now in a position to appreciate. He has found that the mind with
which he carries on the analysis is influencing his findings at every level. In
other words, he has been running after a mirage, due to his ignorance of the
mutual interrelation between name and form. One would not be in such a plight,
if one understands that the real problem at issue is not that of form, but of
the perception of form.</span></p>

That, in effect, is the end of the tangle within and the tangle without. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Our discussion of the law of
dependent arising must have made it clear that there is an interrelation
between name-and-form and consciousness on the one hand, and between name and
form themselves on the other. This, then, is a case of a tangle within and a
tangle without. Like the central spot of a whirlpool, the deepest point of the
entire formula of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da </i>is traceable to the interrelation that obtains
between name and form on the one hand, and between name-and-form and
consciousness on the other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As far as the significance of
perception of form is concerned, the true purpose of the spiritual endeavour,
according to the Buddha, is the very freedom from this perception of form. How
does perception of form come about? It is due to that 'striking against', or
resistance. Perception of form arises, for instance, when gadflies and
mosquitoes land on this body. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we have already mentioned, even
the distinctions of hard and soft, etc., with which we recognize the four
elements, is a matter of touching. We are only trying to measure and gauge the
four great primaries with this human frame. We can never ever comprehend fully
the gamut of these four great primaries. But we are trying to understand them
through this human frame in a way that is meaningful to our lives. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All kinds of beings have their own
specific experience of 'touch', in relation to their experience of the four
elements. So what we have here is entirely a question of perception of form.
The true purpose, then, should be the release of one's mind from this
perception of form. It is only when the mind is freed from resistance and the
perception of form, as well as from name-and-form, that one can win to the
deliverance from this problem of the tangle within and the tangle without that
is <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Yet another fact emerges from the
above discussion. The two views of existence and non-existence, <i>bhava</i>/<i>vibhava</i>,
asserting an absolute existence and an absolute non-existence, seem to have
posed an insoluble problem to many philosophers. Concerning the origin of the
world, they wondered whether <i>sat</i>, or being, came out of <i>asat</i>, or
non-being, or vice versa. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All these problems arose out of a
misunderstanding about form, or material objects, as we may well infer from the
following two lines of a verse in the <i>Kalahaviv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i>
of the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>. <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pesu

&quot;Having seen the existence and destruction of material forms, a man in
this world comes to a conclusion.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is the conclusion? That there
is an absolute existence and an absolute non-existence. One comes to this conclusion
drawing an inference from the behaviour of visible objects. For instance, we
could presume that this machine before us exists in an absolute sense, ignoring
the causes and conditions underlying its existence. The day this machine is
destroyed we would say: &quot;It was, but now it is not.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha has pointed out that
such absolute views of existence and non-existence are a result of an incorrect
understanding about form. What actually is involved here is the perception of
form. Due to a misconception about the perception of form, the world inclines
towards the two extreme views of absolute existence and absolute non-existence.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, quoting the relevant passage from the <i>Khajjan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>yasutta</i> of the <i>Khandhasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>
in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
He has defined the form group with reference to 'affectation': <i>Ruppat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ti kho, bhikkhave, tasm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pan'ti vuccati.</i><a name="_ednref378"></a><a

monks, that is why it is called form. By what is it affected? By cold, heat,
hunger, thirst, and the sting of gadflies, mosquitoes and the like.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While analysing the implications
of this 'being affected', we mentioned that the form group could be compared to
a wound. According to the commentarial exegesis, too, <i>ruppati</i>&nbsp;means
to be adversely affected, to be afflicted, to come into conflict with, to be
diseased and displeased. These are reminiscent of the responses usually
associated with the person who has an easy lacerable wound. To say that a <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ighasamphassa </i>arises&nbsp; because of this
lacerable quality is therefore very apt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The primary sense of the word <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>igha</i> is 'striking against'. Perception of form
arises as a result of an attempt to understand through the factors on the name
side this particular striking against, which resembles the laceration of a
wound. This perception of form, which follows in the wake of the feeling that
arises when something strikes against form, is like the groping of a blind man
in the dark. Generally, the worldling is in the habit of staring at the form
that comes within his grasp, to ascertain its true nature. Likewise, he touches
the form he sees with his eyes to verify it. As the saying goes: 'Seeing is
believing, but touch is the real thing'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But both these attempts are like
the gropings of a blind man. The worldling is unable to get rid of his delusion
completely by either of these methods. It is because he is accustomed to draw conclusions
under the influence of his perception of the compact, <i>ghanasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The fact that the two extreme
views of existence and non-existence are also the outcome of this perception of
the compact in regard to form, is borne out by the following two lines of the
verse we quoted from the <i>Kalahaviv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i>
in our previous sermon. <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pesu disv<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> vibhava<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> bhavaÃ±ca,

&quot;Having seen the existence and destruction of material forms, a man in this
world comes to a conclusion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The worldling has the idea that
material forms have an absolute existence. This idea is the result of his
perception of form. It is a perception arising out of his impression of that
'striking against'. Whatever the level of this perception of form be, it is not
better than the impression of a blind man. The two extreme views of absolute
existence and non-existence in the world are based on this kind of impression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Various types of views and
opinions current in the world regarding material forms and matter in general,
are the outcome of the notion that they are absolutely real. There is a
tendency in the worldling to presume that what he grasps with his hands and
sees with his eyes exists absolutely. So a thing is said to exist for some
length of time, before it gets destroyed. The logical conclusion, then, is that
all things in the world exist absolutely and that at some point of time they
get absolutely destroyed. This is how the two extreme views of absolute
existence and absolute non-existence have arisen in this world. This is the
outcome of a perception of form, which is tantamount to a pursuit of a mirage.
It is an illusion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha has declared, in the <i>Ja<span

resistance and perception of form are cut off and surcease, there the entire <i>sa<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What this verse purports to
describe is the state of a person for whom form as also pleasure and pain has
ceased to exist. He is not one with normal perception, nor is he one with
abnormal perception. He is not non-percipient, nor has he rescinded perception.
It is to one constituted in this manner that form ceases to exist, for, <i>papaÃ±casa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> - whatever they
may be - have perception as their source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The meaning of this verse needs to
be clarified further. According to the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Niddesa</i>,
the allusion in this verse is to one who is on the path to the formless realms,
having attained the first four absorptions.<a name="_ednref384"></a><a
href="#_edn384" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[384]</span></span></a> The commentary is forced to
that conclusion, because it takes the phrase <i>na vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>tasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>as negating formless realms as such. The
assumption is that the person referred to is neither conscious with normal
perception, nor abnormally unconscious, nor devoid of perception, as in the
attainment of cessation, nor in one of the formless attainments. So then, the
only possibility seemed to be to identify it with some intermediate state. That
is why the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Niddesa</i> and the other
commentaries interpret this problematic state as that of one who is on the path
to formless attainments, <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pamaggasama<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gi</i>.<a name="_ednref385"></a><a href="#_edn385"

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, considerations of context
and presentation would lead to a different conclusion. The extraordinary state
alluded to by this verse seems to be a surpamundane one, which goes far deeper
than the so-called intermediate state. The transcendence of form, indicated
here, is more radical than the transcendence in attaining to formless states.
It is a transcendence at a supramundane level, as we may well infer from the
last line of the verse, <i>saÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nid<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> hi papaÃ±casa<span

has a relevance to insight meditation and the denouement of the <i>sutta</i> is
also suggestive of such a background. The <i>Kalahaviv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i>,
consisting of sixteen verses, is, from beginning to end, a network of deep

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in answer to this basic
question that this discourse gradually unfolds itself. In accordance with the
law of dependent arising, the cause of contentions and disputes is said to be
the tendency to hold things dear, <i>piyappah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>t<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> kalah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> viv<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. Then the question
is about the cause of this idea of holding things dear. The cause of it is said
to be desire, <i>chandanid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ni
piy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ni loke.</i> Things dear originate from
desire. Desire, or interest, makes things 'dear'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The next question is: What is the
origin of desire? Desire is traced to the distinction between the pleasant and
the unpleasant. It is in reply to the question regarding the origin of this
distinction between the pleasant and the unpleasant that contact is brought in.
In fact, it is the question as to the origin of contact, <i>phasso nu lokasmi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> kuto nid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>no</i>, which
formed the starting point of our discussion. The answer to that question is
name-and-form, <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>maÃ±ca r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>paÃ±ca</i>.
So in this chain of causes, the link that comes next to contact is name-and-form.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now the verse in question
beginning with <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>goes deeper
than name-and-form. Even the question about contact has a peculiar wording: <i>Kismi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>te na phusanti
phass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;When what is not there, do
touches not touch?&quot; The question, then, is not just the cessation of
contact as such. The answer, too, has the same peculiarity. <i>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pe vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>te na phusanti
phass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;It is when form is not there
that touches do not touch&quot;. It is the subsequent question regarding form
that brings out the cryptic verse as the answer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to show that the
verse in question alludes to a supramundane state far transcending the formless
or any supposed intermediate stage. The transcendence of pleasure and pain, as
well as perception of form, is implied here. The verse beginning with <i>na
saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>brings the entire analytical
disquisition to a climax. It comes as the thirteenth verse in the series.
Usually, such a disquisition leads up to a climax, highlighting <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. It is obvious, therefore, that the reference
here is to the <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic </i>mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have here four negations: <i>Na
saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> - na visaÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>
- no pi asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> - na vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>tasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>.</i> These four negations insinuate a strange
supramundane level of perception. In short, it is an attempt to analyse the
crux of the <i>Dhamma&nbsp;</i>in terms of perception. As to the provocation
for such an approach, we may remind ourselves of the fact that, according to
the Buddha, release from materiality amounted to a release from the perception
of form. Here, we have something really deep. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As it was stated in the <i>Ja<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#257;</span>sutta</i>, for the disentangling of the tangle,
name-and-form, resistance and perception of form, have to be cut off. This last
mentioned perception of form, or <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, is highly significant. Before the advent of the
Buddha the general belief, even among ascetics, was that, in order to be free
from form, one has to attain to the formless, <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>,
But, as we pointed out in an earlier sermon, this kind of approach to the
question of freedom from form, is like the attempt of one who, having imagined
a ghost in the darkness of the night, runs away to escape it.<a
name="_ednref387"></a><a href="#_edn387" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[387]</span></span></a>
He is simply taking the fantasy of the ghost with him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Likewise, perception of form is already
implicit in the formless. What has been done is only a pushing away of the
perception of form with the help of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>. It is merely a suppression of form through the
power of absorption. It does not amount to a cessation of the perception of form.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What, then, is the message the
Buddha gave to the world regarding the abandonment by way of eradication? He
pointed out that freedom from form can be won only by comprehending a certain
deep normative principle behind perception. Till then, one keeps on going round
and round in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.
Even if one breaks away from form to stay for aeons in formless realms, one
swings back to form at the end of that period. Why? Because the ghost of form
still haunts the formless. It is precisely because of this fact that
pre-Buddhistic ascetics could not free themselves from the round of existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The <i>Kalahaviv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta

the two views of existence and non-existence. Our departure from the <i>Mah<span

discourse might sometimes be called in question. But let the wise judge its
reasonableness on its own merits. </span></p>

far, the thirteenth verse marks the climax of the discourse, with its allusion
to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. This is obvious from the
fourteenth verse, in which the questioner confesses: <i>Ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

further proof of the tenability of this interpretation. The verse beginning

because of its unusual accent on the negative particle. We might have to hark
back to it when we come across similar discourses dealing with <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. Till then, let us remind ourselves of two
similes we have already given, in order to get a foretaste of the significance
of this problematic verse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Firstly, the Buddha's simile of
the magic show as an illustration for consciousness in the <i>Phe<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>api<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;&#363;</span>pamasutta</i>
- <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>y<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pamaÃ±ca viÃ±Ã±<span

name="_ednref393"></a><a href="#_edn393" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[393]</span></span></a>
While describing the five groups, he compares consciousness to a magical
performance at crossroads, conducted by a magician or his apprentice. A man
with the right type of vision, watching this magic show, understands that it is
empty, hollow and void of essence. It is as if he has seen through the tricks
and deceptions of the magician. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While watching a magic show, the
audience in general reacts to it with gaping mouths and exclamations. But how
would a man with radical attention and penetrative wisdom, who is fully aware
of the tricks of the magician, watch a magic show? He is simply looking on with
a vacant gaze. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This reminds us of the
significance of the word <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> ananta<span

name="_ednref394"></a><a href="#_edn394" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[394]</span></span></a>
That gaze is 'endless', <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,<i> </i>in
the sense that it does not have the magic show as its object. It goes beyond.
It is also 'non-manifestative',&nbsp;<i>anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
since the magic show does not manifest itself, as it has now been penetrated
through with wisdom. This wisdom is revealing in its 'all lustrous' nature, <i>sabbato
pabha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, so much so that the tricks are seen -
through. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So this man with discernment is
watching with a vacant gaze. Now how would such a person appear to one who is
deluded and enchanted by the magic show? The latter might regard the former as
an inattentive spectator who misses the magic show. Or else, he might think
that the other is out of his senses, or insensate. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What the riddle verse beginning
with <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> refers to, is such a
vacant gaze. That is to say, the person referred to is not one with the

end to perception, <i>na vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>tasaÃ±Ã±<span

vacant gaze of the one who is emancipated through wisdom. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Somewhat on the lines of the
simile used by the Buddha, we might reintroduce, as a flashback, the simile of

Though it has a modernistic flavour, it could perhaps be more easily
understood. Let us suppose that a matinee show of a technicolour film is in
progress with closed doors and windows. Suddenly, by some technical defect, the
doors and windows are flung open. What would be the change of perspective in
the spectator now? He, too, would be looking on with a vacant gaze. Though
still the show is going on, he is no longer seeing it. A sort of 'cessation'
has occurred, at least temporarily. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The theme as well as the objective
of all our sermons is expressed in the quotation beginning with &quot;This is
peaceful, this is excellent&quot; (etc.), which forms the rubric, as it were,
for each sermon. The change that occurs in the spectator now, is somewhat
reminiscent of it. Though not all preparations, at least those preparations
connected with the film show are momentarily 'stilled'. Whatever assets in the
form of the bundle of experiences on which the film show is evalued, are 'relinquished'.
The craving or the desire for the show has gone down. The colourful show has
'faded away', making way for detachment. The film show has 'ceased' for him. It
is also extinct for him, since his burning desire has cooled off now. In this
way, we can understand the four puzzling negations in that riddle verse as an
attempt to describe the vacant gaze of this spectator, and that man with
discernment at the magic show.</span></p>

perception as their source&quot;. <i>PapaÃ±ca&nbsp;</i>is a term with a deep
philosophical dimension in Buddhism. In fact, even the rise of many Buddhist
sects could be put down to an insufficient appreciation of its significance. In
our own philosophical tradition, too, much of the confusion with regard to the
interpretation of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> seems to have
come about due to a lack of understanding in this particular field. Therefore
we propose to devote sufficient time and attention to clarify the significance
of this term <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To begin with, we can bring up
clear evidence of the fact that the word <i>papaÃ±ca</i> is used in the
discourses to convey some deep idea. As a rule, whenever the Buddha presents a
set of ideas pertaining to some <i>Dhamma </i>topic, the deepest or the most
important of them is mentioned last. This feature is quite evident in the <i>A<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, where
very often a sermon is seen to unfold itself in an ascending order, leading to
a climax. In an enumeration of items 'the last but not the least', happens to
be the most important. Granted that this is the general trend, we can trace as
many as nine such contexts among the <i>suttas</i> in which <i>papaÃ±ca</i> is counted
last.<a name="_ednref396"></a><a href="#_edn396" title=""><span

act play. It might not be inapt to say something about the title of this
discourse by way of introduction, before we get down to an analysis of it. At
the conclusion of the discourse, Venerable <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>nanda</i>
makes the following comment on its significance before the Buddha: &quot;Lord,
just as if a man overcome by hunger and exhaustion came upon a honey-ball, and,
from whatever side he goes on licking it, he would get a sweet delectable
flavour which remains unimpaired, so too, Lord, any nimble witted monk, from

questioner. That is to say, generally, in the world, if anyone proclaims a
doctrine, it is natural that it will come into conflict with other doctrines.
Also, in proclaiming that doctrine one has to have latent perceptions relating
to it. The Buddha's reply, however, seems to contradict these presumptions. In
a nutshell, the reply amounts to this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. The main reason
for the confusion is the lack of attention on the part of the commentator to
the peculiar syntax of the formula in question. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this way, we can distinguish
three phases in this description of the process of sense perception in
Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Kacc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na's
</i>exposition. It begins with an impersonal note, but at the point of feeling
it takes on a personal ending, suggestive of deliberate activity. <i>Ya<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though we render the formula in
this way, the commentary explains it differently. It ignores the significance
of the personal ending and interprets the sensory process periphrastically, for
example as <i>saÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> saÃ±j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>,<i> vitakko vitakketi</i>, &quot;perception

feeling occurs, perception comes forward and perceives it, then reasoning takes
up the task of reasoning about perception. <i>PapaÃ±ca</i> then steps in and
converts that reasoning into <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. This is how the commentary
explains that formula. It has left out of account the significance of the use
of the active voice in this section of the formula. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a special purpose in
using the active voice in this context. It is in order to explain how a man is
overwhelmed by <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> - whatever it may be - that Venerable <i>Mah<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Kacc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;has
introduced this sequence of events in three phases. In fact, he is trying to
fill in the gap in the rather elliptical statement of the Buddha, beginning
with <i>yatonid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;
</span></i>beset a man&quot;. The initial phase is impersonal, but then comes
the phase of active participation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>From feeling onwards, the person
behind it takes over. What one feels, one perceives; what one perceives, one
reasons about; what one reasons about, one turns into <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. The
grossest phase is the third. Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Kacc<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nas </i>formula shows how the process of
sense-perception gradually assumes a gross form. This third phase is implicit
in the words <i>ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> papaÃ±ceti tatonid<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> beset that
man&quot;. The word <i>purisa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> is in the
accusative case here, implying that the person who directed sense-perception is
now beset with, or overwhelmed by, <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, as a result of
which all the evil unskilful mental states come to be. This itself is an index
to the importance of the term <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The course of events suggested by
these three phases may be illustrated with the legend of the three magicians.
While journeying through a forest, three men, skilled in magic, came upon a
scattered heap of bones of a tiger. To display their skill, one of them
converted the bones into a complete skeleton, the second gave it flesh and
blood, and the third gave it life. The resurrected tiger devoured all three of
them. It is such a predicament that is hinted at by the peculiar syntax of the
formula in question. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The comparison of this discourse
to a honey-ball is understandable, since it holds the secret of the latent
tendencies towards dogmatic views. It also affords a deep insight into the
nature of the linguistic medium, and words and concepts in everyday usage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We haven't yet clarified the
meaning of the term <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. It is already found in common parlance as a
word suggestive of verbosity and circumlocution. Etymologically, it is
traceable to <i>pra + Ã paÃ±c</i>, and it conveys such meanings as 'spreading
out', 'expansion', 'diffuseness' and 'manifoldness'. Verbosity and
circumlocution usually lead to delusion and confusion. However, the word <i>papaÃ±ca</i>
is sometimes used to denote a conscious elaboration of what is already
expressed in brief. In this particular sense, the cognate term <i>vipaÃ±citaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i> is used in the context of four types of persons,
distinguished according to their levels of understanding, namely <i>uggha<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All in all, <i>papaÃ±ca</i> in
linguistic usage has the insinuation of a certain degree of delusion brought
about by verbosity and circumlocution. But here the term has a deeper
philosophical dimension. Here it is not a case of linguistic usage, but the
behaviour of the mind as such, since it concerns sense-perception. The fact
that it follows in the wake of <i>vitakka</i> is suggestive of its affinity to <i>vic<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>, or discursive thought, so often quoted as the
twin of <i>vitakka</i>, that is as <i>vitakkavic<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.<i>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is the twelfth sermon in the
series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. At the
beginning of our last sermon, we brought up the two terms <i>papaÃ±ca </i>and <i>nippapaÃ±ca</i>,
which help us rediscover quite a deep dimension in Buddhist philosophy, hidden
under the sense of time. In our attempt to clarify the meaning of these two
terms, initially with the help of the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta</i>,<i>
</i>what we could determine so far is the fact that <i>papaÃ±ca</i> signifies a
certain gross state in sense-perception. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though in ordinary linguistic
usage <i>papaÃ±ca </i>meant 'elaboration', 'circumlocution', and 'verbosity',
the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta</i> has shown us
that in the context of sensory perception it has some special significance. It
portrays how a person, who directed sense perception, is overwhelmed by <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>
with regard to sense-objects relating to the three periods of time, past,
present, and future, as a result of his indulging in <i>papaÃ±ca</i>&nbsp;based
on reasoning about percepts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to show that <i>papaÃ±ca</i>&nbsp;has
connotations of some kind of delusion, obsession, and confusion arising in a
man's mind due to sense perception. In explaining the meaning of this term,
commentators very often make use of words like <i>pamatta</i>, 'excessively
intoxicated', 'indolent', <i>pam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>,
'headlessness', and <i>madana</i>, 'intoxication'. For example: <i>Kena<span

</i>in what sense? In the sense that it leads one on to a state of intoxication
and indolence.&quot; Sometimes it is commented on as follows: <i>papaÃ±cit<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ca honti pamatt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>k<span

&quot;They are subject to <i>papaÃ±ca</i>, that is, they become more or less
inebriated or indolent.&quot; Or else it is explained as <i>madan<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

like a term similar in sense to <i>pam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, indolence,
heedlessness. But there is a subtle difference in meaning between them. <i>Pam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, even etymologically, conveys the basic idea of
'excessive intoxication'. It has a nuance of inactivity or inefficiency, due to
intoxication. The outcome of such a state of affairs is either negligence or
heedlessness. But as we have already pointed out, <i>papaÃ±ca</i>&nbsp;has an
etymological background suggestive of expansion, elaboration, verbosity and
circumlocution. Therefore, it has no connotations of inactivity and inefficiency.
On the other hand, it seems to imply an inability to reach the goal due to a
deviation from the correct path. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

distinction in meaning between <i>pam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da </i>and <i>papaÃ±ca</i>&nbsp;with
the help of an illustration. Suppose we ask someone to go on an urgent errant
to Colombo. If instead of going to Colombo, he goes to the nearest tavern and
gets drunk and sleeps there - that is a case of <i>pam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>.
If, on the other hand, he takes to a long labyrinthine road, avoiding the
shortest cut to Colombo, and finally reaches Kandy instead of Colombo - that is
<i>papaÃ±ca</i>. </span></p>

definition of <i>papaÃ±ca </i>as such. It is true that these are instances of <i>papaÃ±ca,</i>
for even in the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta</i> we

'what is worth asserting', <i>ajjhositabba<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>
means 'what is worth clinging on to'. These three expressions are very often
used in the discourses to denote the three defilements craving, conceit and
views. That is to say, 'delighting in' by way of craving with the thought 'this
is mine'; 'asserting' by way of conceit with the thought 'this am I'; and
'clinging on to' with the dogmatic view 'this is my soul'.</span></p>

exegesis on <i>papaÃ±ca </i>in terms of craving, conceit and views is to a great

is that it conveys the sense of proliferation and complexity of thought, on the
lines of those three basic tendencies. That is why the person concerned is said
to be 'overwhelmed by <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span

synonymously in the same way as <i>nirutti, adhivacana </i>and <i>paÃ±Ã±atti</i>.
All these are in sense akin to each other in so far as they represent the

permanence in something. Perception has the characteristic of grasping a sign.
It is with the help of signs that one recognizes. Perceptions of forms,
perceptions of sounds, perceptions of smells, perceptions of tastes, etc., are
so many ways of grasping signs. Just as a party going through a forest would
blaze a trail with an axe in order to find their way back with the help of
notches on the trees, so does perception catch a sign in order to be able to
recognize. </span></p>

groping of a blind man, fumbling in the dark. There is a tendency in the mind
to grasp a sign after whatever is felt. So it gives rise to perceptions of
forms, perceptions of sounds, etc. A sign necessarily involves the notion of
permanence. That is to say, a sign stands for permanence. A sign has to remain
unchanged until one returns to it to recognize it. That is also the secret
behind the mirage nature of perception as a whole.<a name="_ednref414"></a><a

recognition alone is not enough. What is recognized has to be made known to the

uses the language much in the same way as parents make use of a child's homely<span

present this <i>Dhamma</i>, which goes against the current,<a name="_ednref418"></a><a

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[418]</span></span></a> through the medium of worldly
language, with which the worldlings have their transaction in defilements. That
is probably the reason why the Buddha at first hesitated to preach this <i>Dhamma</i>.

importance of the <i>Po<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hap<span

ghee is already inherent in the milk obtained from the cow, he will try to
argue it out on the grounds that after all it is milk that becomes ghee. And
once it becomes ghee, he might imagine that milk is still to be found in ghee,
in some latent form. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a general statement, this might
sound ridiculous. But even great philosophers were unaware of the implications of
their theories. That is why the Buddha had to come out with this homely milk
simile, to bring them to their senses. Here lies the secret of the soul theory.
It carried with it the implication that past and future also exist in the same
sense as the present. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

uses the verb <i>atthi</i>, 'is', only for what exists in the present. He
points out that, whatever is past, should be referred to as <i>ahosi</i>,
'was', and whatever is yet to come, in the future, should be spoken of as <i>bhavissati</i>,
'will be'. This is the fundamental principle underlying the <i>Niruttipathasutta</i>&nbsp;already
quoted. Any departure from it would give rise to such confusions as referred to
above. </span></p>

merely so many stages in a certain process. The worldlings, however, have put
them into watertight compartments, by designating and circumscribing them. They
are caught up in the conceptual trap of their own making. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When the philosophers started
working out the logical relationship between cause and effect, they tended to
regard these two as totally unrelated to each other. Since milk becomes curd,
either the two are totally different from each other, or curd must already be
latent in milk for it to become curd. This is the kind of dilemma their logic posed
for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Indian philosophical systems
reflect a tendency towards such logical subtleties. They ended up with various
extreme views concerning the relation between cause and effect. In a certain
school of Indian philosophy, known as <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rambhav<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, effect is explained as something totally new,
unrelated to the cause. Other schools of philosophy, such as <i>satk<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>av<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, also arose by
confusing this issue. For them, effect is already found hidden in the cause,
before it comes out. Yet others took only the cause as real. Such extreme
conclusions were the result of forgetting the fact that all these are mere
concepts in worldly usage. Here we have a case of getting caught up in a
conceptual trap of one's own making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This confusion regarding the three
periods of time, characteristic of such philosophers, could be illustrated with
some folk tales and fables, which lucidly bring out a deep truth. There is, for
instance, the tale of the goose that lays golden eggs, well known to the West.
A certain goose used to lay a golden egg every day. Its owner, out of excessive
greed, thought of getting all the as yet ones. He killed the goose and opened
it up, only to come to grief. He had wrongly imagined the future to be already
existing in the present. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

soul theorists also committed. In the field of philosophy, too, the prolific
tendency led to such subtle complications. It is not much different from the
proliferations indulged in by the ordinary worldling in his daily life. That is
why reckonings born of prolific perception are said to be so overwhelming. One
is overwhelmed by one's own reckonings and figurings out, under the influence
of prolific perceptions. </span></p>

The pupil of venerable <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gharakkhita Thera</i>,
a nephew of his, indulged in a <i>papaÃ±ca</i>&nbsp;while fanning his teacher.
In his imagination, he disrobed, got married, had a child, and was coming in a
chariot with his wife and child to see his former teacher. The wife, through
carelessness, dropped the child and the chariot run away. So he whipped his
wife in a fit of anger, only to realize that he had dealt a blow on his
teacher's head with the fan still in his hand. Being an <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;with
psychic powers, his teacher immediately understood the pupil's state of mind,
much to the latter's discomfiture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A potter in Sanskrit literature
smashed his pots in a sort of business <i>papaÃ±ca</i> and was remorseful
afterwards. Similarly the proud milk maid in English literature dropped a
bucket of milk on her head in a day dream of her rosy future. In all these
cases one takes as present something that is to come in the future. This is a
serious confusion between the three periods of time. The perception of
permanence, characteristic of concepts, lures one away from reality into a
world of fantasy, with the result that one is overwhelmed and obsessed by it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

designation, being fully aware of their worldly origin, as if they were using a
child's language. When an adult uses a child's language, he is not bound by it.
Likewise, the Buddhas and <i>arahants</i> do not forget that these are worldly
usages. They do not draw any distinction between the relative and the absolute
with regard to those concepts. For them, they are merely concepts and
designations in worldly usage. That is why the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gatas

constructing speculative views by taking too seriously linguistic usage and
grammatical structure. All pre-Buddhistic philosophers made such blunders as
the confusion between milk and curd. Their blunders were mainly due to two
reasons, namely, the persistent latency towards perception and the dogmatic
adherence to views. It is precisely these two points that came up in the very
first statement of the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta</i>,
discussed in our previous sermon. That is to say, they formed the gist of the
Buddha's cursory reply to the <i>Sakyan Da<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ap<span

The Buddha's reply was: &quot;According to whatever doctrine one does not
quarrel or dispute with anyone in the world, such a doctrine do I preach. And
due to whatever statements, perceptions do not underlie as latencies, such
statements do I proclaim.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. The debate had all
the outward appearance of a hot dispute. However, towards the end of it, the
Buddha makes the following challenge to <i>Saccaka</i>: &quot;As for you, <i>Aggivessana,</i>
drops of sweat have come down from your forehead, soaked through your upper
robe and reached the ground. But, <i>Aggivessana</i>, there is no sweat on my
body now.&quot; So saying he uncovered his golden-hued body in that assembly, <i>iti

comprises the Stream-winner, the Once-returner and the Non-returner. Though
there are four types, according to the analysis of their attitudes, the last
two can be regarded as one type, since their attitudes to those concepts are
the same. So we might as well speak of three kinds of attitudes. Let us now try
to understand the difference between them. </span></p>

or a metaphor occurs, as a figure of speech. But here it is something more than
that. Here it refers to an indulgence in a deluded mode of thinking under the
influence of craving, conceit and views. Perceiving earth as 'earth', he imagines
earth to be substantially 'earth'.</span></p>

the fact that he has not fully comprehended it.</span></p>

discourse describes three different attitudes regarding twenty-four concepts

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;The <i>arahant</i> (as well
as the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>) understands through
higher knowledge earth as 'earth', having understood through higher knowledge
earth as 'earth', he does not imagine earth to be 'earth', he does not imagine
'on the earth', he does not imagine 'from the earth', he does not imagine
'earth is mine', he does not delight in earth. Why is that? I say, it is
because it has been well comprehended by him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now try to compare and
contrast these three attitudes, so that we can understand them in greater detail.
The attitude of the untaught ordinary person in regard to any of the
twenty-four concepts like earth, water, fire, air (the twenty-four cited being
illustrations), is so oriented that he perceives it as such. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance in the case of earth,
he perceives a real earth, that is, takes it as earth per se. It may sometimes
be only a block of ice, but because it is hard to the touch, he grasps it as
'earth'. Thus the ordinary person, the worldling, relies only on perception in
his pursuit of knowledge. Having perceived earth as 'earth', he imagines it to
be 'earth'. The peculiarity of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or
'me'-thinking, is that it is an imagining in terms of 'I' and 'mine'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So he first imagines it as
'earth', then he imagines 'on the earth', 'from the earth', 'earth is mine' and
delights in the earth. Here we find various flexional forms known to grammar. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, grammar
itself is a product of the worldlings for purposes of transaction in ideas
bound up with defilements. Its purpose is to enable beings, who are overcome by
the personality view, to communicate with their like-minded fellow beings.
Grammar, therefore, is something that caters to their needs. As such, it
embodies certain misconceptions, some of which have been highlighted in this
context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> maÃ±Ã±ati</i> could
be interpreted as an attempt to imagine an earth - as a full-fledged noun or
substantive. It is conceived as something substantial. By <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>haviy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>,<i> </i>&quot;he imagines 'on the earth'&quot;,
the locative case is implied; while '<i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> me'ti maÃ±Ã±ati</i>, &quot;he imagines 'earth is
mine'&quot;, is an instance of the genitive case, expressing the idea of
possession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Due to such imaginings, a reality
is attributed to the concept of 'earth' and its existence is taken for granted.
In other words, these various forms of imaginings go to confirm the notion
already aroused by the concept of 'earth'. Once it is confirmed one can delight
in it, <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
abhinandati</i>. This, then, is the worldview of the untaught ordinary person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The other day we mentioned that
the monk who is in higher training understands through higher knowledge, not
through perception, earth as 'earth'. Though it is a higher level of
understanding, he is not totally free from imaginings. That is why certain
peculiar expressions are used in connection with him, such as <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>avi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
maÃ±Ã±i, pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>haviy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> m<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i, pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havito m<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i, 'pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> me'ti m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i, pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
abhinandi.</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we have to call in question
the commentarial explanation. According to the commentary, this peculiar expression
had to be used as a dilly dally phrase, because the monk in higher training
could not be said to imagine or not imagine.<a name="_ednref440"></a><a
href="#_edn440" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[440]</span></span></a> But it is clear enough that the
particle <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> in this context is used in its
prohibitive sense. <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i</i> means &quot;do
not imagine!&quot;, and <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> abhinandi </i>means
&quot;do not delight!&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is significant about the <i>sekha</i>,
the monk in higher training, is that he is in a stage of voluntary training. In
fact, the word <i>sekha</i> literally means a &quot;learner&quot;. That is to
say, he has obtained a certain degree of higher understanding but has not
attained as yet full comprehension. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is precisely for that reason
that the section about him is summed up by the statement: <i>Ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> kissa hetu? PariÃ±Ã±eyya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
tass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>'ti vad<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi</i>.
&quot;Why is that? Because, I say, that it should be comprehended by him.&quot;
Since he has yet to comprehend it, he is following that course of higher
training. The particle <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> is therefore a
pointer to that effect. For example, <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i</i>
&quot;do not imagine!&quot;, <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> abhinandi </i>&quot;do
not delight!&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In other words, the monk in higher
training cannot help using the grammatical structure in usage among the
worldlings and as his latencies are not extinct as yet, he has to practise a certain
amount of restraint. By constant employment of mindfulness and wisdom he makes
an attempt to be immune to the influence of the worldling's grammatical
structure. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a possibility that he
would be carried away by the implications of such concepts as earth, water,
fire and air, in his communications with the world regarding them. So he
strives to proceed towards full comprehension with the help of the higher
understanding already won, keeping mindfulness and wisdom before him. That is
the voluntary training implied here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The monk in higher training is
called <i>attagutto</i>, in the sense that he tries to guard himself.<a
name="_ednref441"></a><a href="#_edn441" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[441]</span></span></a>
Such phrases like <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±i</i>&nbsp;indicate
that voluntary training in guarding himself. Here we had to add something more
to the commentarial explanation. So this is the situation with the monk in
higher training.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now as to the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;and
the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, the world views of both are
essentially the same. That is to say, they both have a higher knowledge as well
as a full comprehension with regard to the concept of earth, for instance. <i>PariÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> tass<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>'ti
vad<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi</i>, &quot;I say it has been comprehended
by him&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As such, they are not carried away
by the implications of the worldlings' grammatical structure. They make use of
the worldly usage much in the same way as parents do when they are speaking in
their child's language. They are not swept away by it. There is no inner
entanglement in the form of imagining. There is no attachment, entanglement and
involvement by way of craving, conceit and view, in regard to those concepts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to show the immense
importance of the <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lapariy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yasutta</i>.
One can understand why this <i>sutta</i> came to be counted as the first among
the <i>suttas</i> of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
It is as if this <i>sutta&nbsp;</i>was intended to serve as the alphabet in
deciphering the words used by the Buddha in his sermons delivered in discursive
style. As a matter of fact the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>
in particular is a text abounding in deep <i>suttas</i>. This way we can
understand why both higher knowledge and full comprehension are essential. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have shown above that this
discourse bears some relation to the grammatical structure. Probably due to a
lack of recognition of this relationship between the modes of imagining and the
grammatical structure, the commentators were confronted with a problem while
commenting upon this discourse. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such phrases as <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> maÃ±Ã±ati </i>and <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>haviy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> maÃ±Ã±ati </i>occur
all over this discourse in referring to various ways of imagining. The
commentator, however, always makes it a point to interpret these ways of
imagining with reference to craving, conceit and views. So when he comes to the
phrase <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> abhinandi</i>,<i> </i>he finds it to
be superfluous. That is why Venerable <i>Buddhaghosa </i>treats it as a
repetition and poses a possible question as follows: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this is how the commentator
poses his own problem: When the phrase <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> maÃ±Ã±ati </i>by itself fulfils the purpose, why is it
that an additional phrase like <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> abhinandati</i>&nbsp;is brought in? That is to say, if
the imagining already implies craving, conceit and views, what is the
justification for the concluding phrase <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> abhinandati</i>, &quot;he delights in earth&quot;,
since craving already implies a form of delighting? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So he takes it as a repetition and
seeks for a justification. He confesses that the ancients have not handed down
an explanation and offers his own personal opinion on it, <i>aya<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pana me attano mati, </i>&quot;but then this is my
own opinion&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And what does his own explanation
amount to? <i>Desan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vil<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sato
v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; &#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>navadassanato
v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;either as a particular style in
preaching, or by way of showing the perils of the ways of imagining&quot;. He
treats it as yet another way of preaching peculiar to the Buddha, or else as an
attempt to emphasize the perils of imagining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, going by the explanation
we have already given above, relating these modes of imagining to the structure
of grammar, we can come to a conclusion as to why the phrase <i>m<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> abhinandi </i>was brought in. The reason is that each
of those concepts crystallized into a real thing as a result of imagining,
based on the framework of grammar. It received real object status in the world
of imagination. Once its object status got confirmed, one can certainly delight
in it. It became a thing in truth and fact. The purpose of these ways of
imagining is to mould it into a thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us go deeper into this
problem. There is, for instance, a certain recurrent passage in the discourses
on the subject of sense restraint.<a name="_ednref443"></a><a href="#_edn443"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[443]</span></span></a>
The gist of that passage amounts to this: A person with defilements takes in
signs and features through all the six sense doors, inclusive of the mind. Due
to that grasping at signs and features, various kinds of influxes are said to
flow in, according to the passages outlining the practice of sense restraint.
From this we can well infer that the role of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,&nbsp;or
imagining, is to grasp at signs with regard to the objects of the mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That is to say, the mind
apperceives its object as 'something', <i>dhammasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
The word <i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;in the opening sentence of this <i>sutta</i>, <i>sabbadhammam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lapariy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vo, bhikkhave, desess<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi</i>,
means a 'thing', since every-thing is an object of the mind in the last
analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>,<i> </i>&quot;he imagines earth

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The two terms <i>nimitta, </i>sign,
and <i>anuvyaÃ±jana</i>, feature, in the context of sense restraint have to be
understood in this way. Now the purpose of a <i>nimitta</i>, or sign, is to
give a hazy idea like 'this may be so'. It receives confirmation with the help
of corroborative features, <i>anuvyaÃ±jana</i>, all the features that are
accessory to the sign. The corroboration comes, for instance, in this manner:
'This goes well with this, this accords with this, therefore the sign I took is
right'. So even on the basis of instructions on sense restraint, we can
understand the special significance of this <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The reason for the occurrence of
these different ways of me-thinking can also be understood. In this discourse
the Buddha is presenting a certain philosophy of the grammatical structure. The
structure of grammar is a contrivance for conducting the worldlings' thought
process, characterised by the perception of permanence, as well as for
communication of ideas arising out of that process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The grammatical structure invests
words with life, as it were. This mode of hypostasizing is revealed in the
nouns and substantives implying such notions as 'in it', 'by it' and 'from it'.
The last of the flexional forms, the vocative case, <i>he pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>havi</i>,
&quot;hey earth&quot;,<i> </i>effectively illustrates this hypostasizing
character of grammar. It is even capable of infusing life into the concept of

entertain some kind of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or
me-thinking. Even some philosophers are prone to that habit. They indulge in
some sort of prolific conceptualisation and me-thinking on the basis of such
conventional usages as 'in <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>', 'from <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The primary sense of the word <i>Nibb<span

already discussed this point with reference to such contexts as <i>Aggivacchagottasutta</i>.<a

&nbsp;In that discourse the Buddha explained the term <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
to the wandering ascetic <i>Vacchagotta</i>&nbsp;with the help of a simile of
the extinction of a fire. Simply because a fire is said to go out, one should
not try to trace it, wondering where it has gone. The term <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is essentially a verbal noun. We also came
across the phrase <i>nibbuto tveva sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kha<span

therefore some sort of reckoning, an appellation or designation. The word <i>Nibb<span

The commentator, it seems, is at pains to salvage our <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
but his attempt is at odds with the trend of this discourse, because the <i>sekha</i>,<i>
</i>or the monk in higher training, has no need to train himself in refraining
from delighting in any heretical <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.

nouns and verbs reflect the worldling's mode of thinking. As in the case of a

evident even in the relation between the noun and the verb. The noun has
adjectives as attributes and the verb has adverbs to go with it. Particles fall
in between, and there we have what is called grammar. If one imagines that the

that nouns are invested with a certain amount of permanence. Even a verbal

nature of the so-called river. This is the result of the perception of
permanence. </span></p>

these reckonings, appellations and designations, because the perception of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Since we have been talking about
the concept of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> so much, one might
ask: 'So then, <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is not an absolute, <i>paramattha</i>?'
It is not a <i>paramattha</i> in the sense of an absolute. It is a <i>paramattha</i>
only in the sense that it is the highest good, <i>parama attha</i>. This is the
sense in which the word was used in the discourses,<a name="_ednref458"></a><a

the attainment of the highest good&quot;, the <i>suttas </i>speak of <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In later Buddhist thought,
however, the word <i>paramattha</i>&nbsp;came to acquire absolutist
connotations, due to which some important discourses of the Buddha on the
question of worldly appellations, worldly expressions and worldly designations
fell into disuse. This led to an attitude of dwelling in the scaffolding,
improvised just for the purpose of constructing a building. </span></p>

distinguished from all other discourses in respect of one significant feature.
That is, the concluding statement to the effect that the monks who listened to
the sermon were not pleased by it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

This is probably why this discourse came to be neglected in the course of time.
But on the basis of the exposition we have attempted, we might advance a
different interpretation of the attitude of those monks. The declaration that
none of the concepts, including that of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
should be egoistically imagined, could have caused displeasure in monks, then
as now. So much, then, for the <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lapariy<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yasutta</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha has pointed out that
this <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or egoistic imagining, or
me-thinking, is an extremely subtle bond of <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.
A discourse which highlights this fact comes in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta
Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i> under the title <i>Yavakal<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>pisutta</i>.<a name="_ednref463"></a><a href="#_edn463"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[463]</span></span></a>
In this discourse the Buddha brings out this fact with the help of a parable.
It concerns the battle between gods and demons, which is a theme that comes up
quite often in the discourses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In a war between gods and demons,
the gods are victorious and the demons are defeated. The gods bind <i>Vepacitti</i>,
the king of the demons, in a fivefold bondage, that is, hands and feet and
neck, and bring him before <i>Sakka,</i> the king of the gods. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This bondage has a strange
mechanism about it. When <i>Vepacitti </i>thinks 'gods are righteous, demons
are unrighteous, I will go to the <i>deva</i> world', he immediately finds
himself free from that bondage and capable of enjoying the heavenly pleasures
of the five senses. But as soon as he slips into the thought 'gods are
unrighteous, demons are righteous, I will go back to the <i>asura </i>world',
he finds himself divested of the heavenly pleasures and bound again by the
fivefold bonds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>After introducing this parable,
the Buddha comes out with a deep disquisition of <i>Dhamma</i> for which it

the meaning of this exhortation. The opening sentence is an allusion to the

his thoughts. Its very mechanism is dependent on his thoughts. </span></p>

what is this bondage of <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>?
&quot;Imagining, monks, one is bound by <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
not imagining one is freed from that Evil One.&quot; Then comes a list of nine

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the same discourse the Buddha
goes on to qualify each of these imaginings with four significant terms, namely

allusion to the fickleness of the mind, as for instance conveyed by the first
line of a verse in the <i>Dhammapada</i>, <i>phandana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

'am', is the most elementary standard of measurement. It is the peg from which

persons, first person, second person and third person, we happened to mention
that as soon as one grants 'I am', a 'here' is born. It is only after a 'here'

multifarious imaginings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in the nature of these
imaginings that as soon as an imagining or a me-thinking occurs, a thing is
born as a matter of course. And with the birth of a thing as 'something',
impermanence takes over. That is to say, it comes under the sway of
impermanence. This is a very strange phenomenon. It is only after becoming a
'something' that it can become 'another thing'. <i>AÃ±Ã±ath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span

an error. So from the couplet quoted above we clearly understand how subtle
this <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> is and why it is called an

as follows: Once <i>Sakka</i>, the king of the gods, came to see the Buddha
when he was staying at <i>Pubb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma

destruction of craving?' The quintessence of the Buddha's brief reply to that
question is the above mentioned dictum, <i>sabbe dhamm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

in this sermon approvingly and left. Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, who was seated near the Buddha at that time, had
the inquisitive thought: 'Did <i>Sakka</i> rejoice in this sermon having
understood it, or did he rejoice without understanding it?' Being curious to
find this out he vanished from <i>Pubb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma</i> and appeared in the <i>T<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vati<span

welcomed the latter, saying: 'Come good sir <i>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
welcome good sir <i>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>! It is a long
time, good sir <i>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, since you found
an opportunity to come here.' </span></p>

Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
and took a low seat at one side. Then Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>asked <i>Sakka</i> what sort of a sermon the
Buddha had preached to him on his recent visit, saying that he himself is
curious on listening to it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sakka's</span></i><span

was: 'Good sir <i>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, we are so busy,
we have so much to do, not only with our own business, but also with the
business of other gods of <i>T<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vati<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sa</i>. So it is not easy for us to remember such <i>Dhamma</i>
discussions.' Then <i>Sakka</i> goes on to relate some other episode, which to
him seems more important: 'After winning the war against the <i>asuras</i>, I
had the <i>Vejayanti </i>palace built. Would you like to see it, good sir <i>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

binding on a visitor, Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>agreed and <i>Sakka </i>conducted him around the
<i>Vejayanti </i>palace in the company of his friend, king <i>Vessava<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>. It was a wonderful palace with hundreds of
towers. <i>Sakka's </i>maids, seeing Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>coming in the distance, were embarrassed out of
modest respect and went into their rooms. <i>Sakka </i>was taking Venerable <i>Mah<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;around,
saying: 'See, good sir, how lovely this palace is.' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>also courteously responded, saying that it is a
fitting gift for his past merit. But then he thought of arousing a sense of
urgency in <i>Sakka</i>, seeing: how negligent he has become now. And what did
he do? He shook the <i>Vejayanti </i>palace with the point of his toe, using
his supernormal power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Since <i>Sakka </i>had 'entered
into' the <i>Vejayanti </i>palace with his craving, conceit and views, he also
was thoroughly shaken, along with the palace. That is to say, a sense of
urgency was aroused in him, so much so that he remembered the sermon the Buddha
had preached to him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It was then that Venerable <i>Mah<span

pointedly: 'How did the Exalted One state to you in brief the deliverance
through the destruction of craving?' <i>Sakka </i>came out with the full
account, creditably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So after all it seems that the
Venerable <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Moggall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
took all this trouble to drive home into <i>Sakka</i> the moral of the sermon <i>sabbe

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> abhinives<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If one goes through this discourse
ignoring the deeper aspects of it, it appears merely as a fairy tale. Even as
those heavenly maidens entered their rooms, <i>Sakka</i> also had entered into
this <i>Vejayanti</i>&nbsp;palace of his own creation, while showing his
distinguished visitor around, like a rich man these days after building his
mansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So from this we can see the nature
of these worldly concepts. For instance, in the case of the concept of 'a
house', entering the house physically does not necessarily mean that one is 'in
it'. Only if one has entered into the concept of a house is he 'in it'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us take a simply analogy.
Little children sometimes build a little hut, out of fun, with a few sticks and
shady leaves. They might even invite their mother for the house-warming. When
the mother creeps into the improvised hut, she does not seriously entertain the
concept of 'a house' in it, as the children would do. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the same in the case of
Buddhas and <i>arahants.</i>&nbsp;To the Emancipated Ones, who have fully
understood and comprehended the true meaning of concepts like 'house',
'mansion' and 'palace', the sandcastles of adults appear no better than the
playthings of little children. We have to grant it, therefore, that <i>Tath<span

relativity between a house and a tile as well as between a house and a brick.
So there is no need to get down to an atomistic analysis like nuclear
physicists. Wisdom is something that enables one to see this relativity penetratively,
then and there.</span></p>

deep sections of the <i>Dhamma</i>, particularly on the subject of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span

the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya

this subtle conceit 'am', <i>asmim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, are
mere imaginings or methinkings, and that they are called a bondage of <i>M<span

dichotomy, even like the dilemma posed by the fivefold bondage of <i>Vepacitti</i>,

shall be percipient' or 'I shall be non-percipient', or 'I shall be

here. The fact that these imaginings, which follow a dichotomy, must be

the theme and gradually developing it, analysing, clarifying, and expatiating,
as the discourse proceeds. The opening sentence in the above paragraph is a
quotation of a part of that original statement of the Buddha, which forms the
theme. Here is the rendering:</span></p>

of imaginings no longer occur in him, and when the tides of imaginings occur no
more in him, he is called a sage stilled', so it was said. And with reference
to what was this said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>'Am', monk, is something imagined;
'I am this' is something imagined; 'I shall be' is something imagined; 'I shall

imagined; 'I shall be formless' is something imagined; 'I shall be percipient'
is something imagined; 'I shall be non-percipient' is something imagined; 'I
shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient' is something imagined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The imagined is a disease, the
imagined is an abscess, the imagined is a dart. It is with the surmounting of
all what is imagined, monk, that a sage is called 'stilled'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The sage who is stilled is not
born, nor does he age, nor does he die, nor is he shaken, and he has no
longing. Even that is not in him whereby he might be born. Not being born, how
shall he age? Not aging, how shall he die? Not dying, how shall he be shaken?
Being unshaken, what shall he long for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So it was with reference to this,
that it was said 'steadied whereon the tides of imaginings no longer occur in
him, and when the tides of imagining occur no more in him, he is called a sage
stilled'.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to show how relevant
the question of imaginings is to the path leading to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
This pithy passage, which brings the discourse to a climax, portrays how the
sage is at peace when his mind is released by stemming the tides of imaginings.
He attains release from birth, decay and death, here and now, because he has
realized the cessation of existence in this very world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is in this light that we have
to interpret the above statement &quot;even that is not in him whereby he might
be born&quot;. Dependent on existence is birth. Due to whatever postulate of
existence one can speak of a 'birth', even that existence is not in him. Not
being born, how can he age? How can he grow old or decay? This is because of
the implicit interrelation between conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we can flash back to our
analogy of a tree, mentioned earlier.<a name="_ednref480"></a><a href="#_edn480"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[480]</span></span></a>
In order to explain the mutual interrelation between the concepts of birth,
decay and death, we brought up a simile, which however is not canonical. That
is to say, supposing there is some kind of a tree, the buds, the leaves, the
flowers, the fruits and the wood of which could be sold for making one's
livelihood. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If five men trading in those items
respectively are made to line up at some particular stage in the growth of this
tree and asked whether the tree is too young or too old, the answers given
might differ according to the individual standpoint grasped in each case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It turns out to be a difference of
viewpoint. For instance, the man who makes his living by selling the buds would
reply that the tree is too old when the buds turn into leaves. Similarly, when
it is the season for the leaves to fall and the flowers to bloom, one who
trades in leaves might say that the tree is too old. And when flowers turn into
fruits, the florist's viewpoint would be similar. In this way one can
understand how this concept changes according to what one grasps - that there
is an implicit relativity about it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, as for this sage, he has
given up everything that he had grasped. Grasping has been given up completely.
Imagining, too, has been abandoned. Hence, not being 'born', how shall he age?
The sage has no postulate of existence. Since there is no existence, there is
no 'birth'. Because there is no birth, there is no decay. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is a well known fact that the
term <i>jar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>&nbsp;implies both growth and
decay. It is after setting a limit that we speak of a process of 'decay', after
'growth'. This limit, however, varies according to our individual standpoint
grasped - according to our point of view. That is what we have tried to
illustrate by this analogy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then we have the statement
&quot;not aging, how shall he die?&quot; Since decay is an approach to death,
where there is no decay, there is no death. The fact that there is no death we
have already seen in our exposition of the significance of the verses quoted
above from the <i>Adhimutta Therag<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>th<span

longing, desiring for something or other. In this context it refers to that

longings. <i>Akuppam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>no kissa pihessati</i>,

clearly understand from this discourse why <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>is known as a decayless, deathless state, realizable in this very world.
That sage has conquered decay and death here and now, because he has realized
the cessation of existence, here and now. </span></p>

wonderful about the <i>arahant</i>. He realizes the cessation of existence in

grasping. Where there is no grasping, there is no existence. Because there is
no existence, birth, decay and death, along with sorrow and lamentation, cease

The entire mass of suffering, summed up by the terms birth, decay, death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, are basically of a mental origin.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For an illustration of this fact,
we can go back to our analogy of winding some strands into a rope, mentioned
earlier.<a name="_ednref485"></a><a href="#_edn485" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[485]</span></span></a>
We pointed out that in the case of some strands that are being mistakenly wound
in the same direction, it is the grasp in the middle that gives at least a
semblance of a rope to it. So long as there is no such grasping, the strands do
not become knotty or tense, as they go round and round. It is only when someone
grasps it in the middle that the strands begin to get winded up, knotty and
tense. What is called existence, or becoming, <i>bhava</i>, follows the same
norm. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>True to the law of impermanence,
everything in the world changes. But there is something innocent in this
change. Impermanence is innocuous in itself. We say it is innocuous because it
means no harm to anyone. It is simply the nature of this world, the suchness,
the norm. It can do us harm only when we grasp, just as in the case of that
quasi rope. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The tenseness between winding and
unwinding, arising out of that grasp in the middle, is comparable to what is
called <i>bhavasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
&quot;preparations for existence&quot;. <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or preparations,
are said to be dependent on <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, or
ignorance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now we can form an idea of the
relationship between these two even from this analogy of the rope. The grasp in
the middle creates two ends, giving rise to a dilemma. In the case of
existence, too, grasping leads to an antinomian conflict. To become a thing, is
to disintegrate into another thing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On a previous occasion we happened
to discuss the significance of the term <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
me-thinking or imagining, with reference to the verse <i>yena yena hi maÃ±Ã±ati,

MaÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> itself gives rise to a 'thing', which
from its very inception goes on disintegrating into another thing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Just as much as grasping leads to
the concept of two ends, to become a thing is to start changing into another
thing, that is, it comes under the sway of the law of impermanence.

their significance is often ignored.</span></p>

a not-born, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded, therefore there is a

The Buddha declares that if not for this not-born, not-become, not-made,
not-compounded, there would be no possibility of stepping out or release here,
that is, in this very world, from the born, the become, the made and the
compounded. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The second half of the passage
rhetorically reiterates and emphasises the same fact. Now as to the
significance of this profound declaration of the Buddha, we may point out that
the terms not-born, not-become, not-made, not-compounded, suggest the
emancipation of the <i>arahant's </i>mind from birth, becoming and
preparations, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. They refer to the cessation of birth, becoming
and preparations realized by the <i>arahant</i>. So then the significance of
these terms is purely psychological. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But the commentator, the Venerable
<i>Dhammap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>la</i>, pays little attention to the
word <i>idha</i>, &quot;here&quot;, in this passage, which needs to be emphasized.
The fact that there is a possibility here and now, of stepping out from the
state of being born, become, made and compounded, surely deserves emphasis,
since, until then, release from decay and death was thought to be possible only
in another dimension of existence, that is, after death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The prospect of stepping out from
decay and death here and now in this very world has to be asserted for its
novelty, which is why the declaration opens with the word <i>atthi</i>,
&quot;there is&quot;. However, most of the scholars who tried to interpret this
passage in their discussion on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
instead of laying stress on the word <i>idha, </i>&quot;here&quot;, emphasize
the opening word <i>atthi</i>, &quot;there is&quot;, to prove that <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is some form of reality absolutely existing
somewhere. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As that passage from the <i>Dhatuvibha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta</i>&nbsp;on <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
which we discussed, has shown us, the terms <i>aj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Existence is a conceit deep rooted
in the mind, which gives rise to a heap of pervert notions. Its cessation,
therefore, has also to be accomplished in the mind and by the mind. This is the
gist of the Buddha's exhortation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now come back to the <i>Dhatuvibha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta </i>to discuss another facet of it. We started
our discussion with the grand finale of that discourse, because of its
relevance to the question of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
However, as a matter of fact, this discourse preached by the Buddha to the
Venerable <i>Pukkus<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i> is an exposition of a
systematic path of practice for the emancipation of the mind from imaginings or
<i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The discourse begins with the
declaration <i>chadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>turo aya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,

The worldling thinks that a being, <i>satta </i>(Sanskrit <i>sattva</i>),
exists at a higher level of reality than inanimate objects. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now what did the Buddha do to
explode this concept of a being in his discourse to Venerable <i>Pukkus<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>? He literally thrashed out that concept, by
breaking up this 'man' into his basic elements and defining him as a bundle of
six elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As the discourse proceeds, he
explains in an extremely lucid manner how one can detach one's mind from each
of these elements. We happened to mention at the very outset that the depth of
the <i>Dhamma</i> has to be seen through lucidity and not through complicated
over-drawings. In fact, this discourse exhibits such lucidity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The meditation subject of
elements, which grew in complexity at the hands of later Buddhist philosophers,
who took to atomistic analysis of a speculative sort, is presented here in this
<i>Dhatuvibha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta</i>&nbsp;with a refreshing
clarity and lucidity. Here it is explained in such a way that one can directly
experience it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance in describing the
earth element, the Buddha gives as examples of the internal earth element such
parts of the body as head hairs, body hairs, nails and teeth. Because the
external earth element hardly needs illustration, nothing in particular has been
mentioned as to that aspect. Anyone can easily understand what is meant by it.
There is no attempt at atomistic analysis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

thus with right wisdom as it is, he becomes dejected with the earth element, he

the case with this 'man'. What is found in his body is the earth element. What
is to be found outside is also the earth element. And yet, the ordinary person
sees quite a wide disparity between the two. Why is that? That is because of
the illusory nature of consciousness. </span></p>

Even as one who comes before a mirror, on seeing his reflection on it, would
say: 'this is mine', 'this am I', 'this is my self', the worldling is in the

elements earth, water, fire and air, the Buddha pointed out a way of liberating
one's mind from the space element with the help of similar illustrations. In
explaining the space element, too, he gave easily intelligible examples. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

did not speak of any microscopic space element, as in scientific explanations,
probably because it is irrelevant. Such an analysis is irrelevant for this kind
of reflection. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we have to bear in mind the

analysing, form and space are relative to each other like a picture and its
background. A picture is viewed against its background, which is relative to
it. So also are these two concepts of form and space. Consciousness provides
the framework for the entire picture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of clarification we may
allude to the pre-Buddhistic attempts of Yogins to solve this problem, solely
through the method of serenity,<i> samatha</i>, ignoring the method of insight,
<i>vipassan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. The procedure they followed was
somewhat on these lines: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>They would first of all surmount
the concept of form or matter through the first four mental absorptions, or <i>jh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nas</i>. Then as they inclined towards the formless,
what confronted them first was space. A very appropriate illustration in this
context would be the method of removing the sign of the <i>kasi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i> and attending to the space left by that removal
as 'infinite' or 'boundless', in order to arouse the base of infinity of space.<a

conditions as purely external things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we see the relativity between
form and space. Like the picture and its background, form and space stand
relative to each other. All this is presented to us by attention, <i>manasik<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some of the later speculations
about the nature of the space element are not in consonance with the basic
principles outlined in the <i>Dhamma</i>. Such confusion arose probably due to
a lack of understanding of the term <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now if we are to say something
more about this particular discourse, what remains after detaching one's mind
from these five elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and space, is a
consciousness that is extremely pure. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The basic function of
consciousness is discrimination. It distinguishes between the bitter and the
sweet, for instance, to say: 'this is bitter', 'this is sweet'. Or else it
distinguishes between the pleasant, the unpleasant and the neutral with regard
to feelings: 'this is pleasant', 'this is unpleasant', 'this is
neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now that the five elements earth,
water, fire, air and space, which create discrete objects as the outward
manifestations of consciousness, have been totally removed, the residual
function of consciousness amounts to a discrimination between the three grades
of feelings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The sage who has arrived at this
stage of progress on the path to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
takes the next step by observing these three kinds of feelings, pleasant,
unpleasant and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, as they arise and cease
dependent on specific contacts, thereby gradually bringing the mind to
equanimity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>He brings his mind to a stage of
radiant equanimity. But even this equanimity he does not grasp by way of
me-thinking or imagining. The phrase used in this connection is <i>visa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutto na<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vedeti</i>,
&quot;being detached he experiences it&quot;.<a name="_ednref505"></a><a
href="#_edn505" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[505]</span></span></a> There is a detachment, an
aloofness, even in going through those sensations. This is clearly expressed in
that context. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, in the case of a
pleasant feeling, it is said: <i>anicc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ti paj<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti, anajjhosit<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ti paj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti,
anabhinandit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ti paj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>, &quot;he understands it to be impermanent, he
understands it to be uninvolved, he understands it to be unrejoiced&quot;. With
the understanding of impermanence, conceit goes down. The non-involvement does
away with the views. The absence of rejoicing suggests the extinction of
craving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the attainment of <i>arahant</i>-hood
is in effect the cessation of that consciousness itself. That consciousness is
divested of its most primary function of discriminating between the three
grades of feeling, pleasant, unpleasant and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The term <i>visa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutto
</i>connotes disjunction, suggestive of dispassion and detachment. In this way,
the <i>Dhatuvibha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta </i>clearly brings out
the relevance of the question of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> to
the path leading to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.<i> </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In some contexts, this practice of
desisting from me-thinking or imagining is called <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
non-identification. This is the term used by the Buddha throughout the <i>Sappurisasutta</i>&nbsp;of
the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. For instance we read there:

thus: the principle of non-identification has been recommended by the Buddha
even with regard to the attainment of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception thus: in whatever way they imagine about

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The 'good man' referred to here is

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This term <i>tammaya </i>needs to
be clarified in order to understand the significance of this statement. It is
derived from <i>tad</i> <i>maya</i>, literally &quot;made of that&quot; or
&quot;of that stuff&quot;. It is on a par with such terms as <i>sova<span

silvery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When one has cravings, conceits
and views about something, he practically becomes one with it due to that very
grasping. In other words, he identifies himself with it. That is why the person
who has imaginings about the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
which he has attained, thinks 'I am one who has attained the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>He thereby has conceit, which is a
defilement in itself. As a result, when he loses his mastery of that
attainment, he becomes disconcerted. It is for that reason that the Buddha had
enjoined that one should cultivate the attitude of <i>atammayat<span

attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. </span></p>

unexpressed, they seem to imply the relevance of <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i><span

imaginings or methinkings by way of craving, conceit and views, lead to an
identification, for which the term used is <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.

significance, we brought up a quotation of two lines from the <i>Jar<span

for the <i>arahant</i> in the sense that he has &quot;shaken off&quot; the dust
of defilements. So then, these two lines imply that the <i>arahant</i> does not
imagine thereby, namely <i>yadida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, in terms
of whatever is seen, heard or sensed. These two lines are, as it were, a random
exegesis of our riddle terms in the <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The first line itself gives the
clue to the rather elliptical term <i>na tena</i>, which carries no verb with
it. Our quotation makes it clear that the implication is <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span

makes no mention of the word <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, this
particular expression seems to suggest that what is implied here is a form of
imagining. By way of further proof we may allude to another quotation, which we
had to bring up several times: <i>Yena yena hi maÃ±Ã±anti, tato ta<span

therefore, from the above quoted two lines of the verse, is that what is to be
understood by the elliptical expression <i>na tena</i> in the <i>B<span

implied by the word <i>tena</i>, or &quot;by it&quot;, can also be easily
inferred from those two lines. In fact, the second line beginning with the word
<i>yadida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, which means &quot;namely&quot; or
&quot;that is&quot;, looks like a commentary on the first line itself. The <i>dhono</i>,
or the <i>arahant</i>, does not imagine 'thereby', namely by whatever is seen,
heard and sensed. </span></p>

its framework the four terms <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha,

me-thinkings about the seen is therefore the way to stop short at just the
seen. If one does not stop short at just the seen, but goes on imagining in
terms of 'in the seen', 'from the seen', etc., as already stated, one will end
up with an identification, or <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the term <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. When one starts
imagining in such terms about something, one tends to become one with it, <i>tammayo</i>,
even as things made out of gold and silver are called golden, <i>suva<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>amaya</i>, and silvery, <i>rajatamaya</i>. It
is as if one who grasps a gem becomes its owner and if anything happens to the gem
he is affected by it. To possess a gem is to be possessed by it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When one gets attached and becomes
involved and entangled in the seen through craving, conceit and views, by
imagining egoistically, the result is identification, <i>tammayat<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the Buddha puts <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya D<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ruc<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>riya</i> on the path to non-identification, or <i>atammayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. That is to say, he advises <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya
</i>not to indulge in such imaginings. That attitude leads to
non-identification and detachment. When one has no attachments, involvements
and entanglements regarding the seen, one does not have the notion of being in
the seen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

for instance <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i> does not imagine 'by
the seen', he is not 'in the seen'. Likewise, he is not in the heard, sensed or

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[521]</span></span></a> We also pointed out that the
grammatical structure springs up along with it. That is to say, together with
the notion 'am' there arises a 'here'. 'Here' am I, he is 'there' and you are
'yon' or in front of me. This is the basic ground plan for the grammatical structure,
known to grammar as the first person, the second person and the third person.</span></p>

and a grammatical structure springs up. This, in fact, is the origin of
proliferation, or <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. So it is the freedom from that proliferation
that is meant by the expression <i>nev'idha na hura<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
na ubhayamantarena</i>, &quot;neither here nor there nor between the two&quot;.
The notion of one's being in the world, or the bifurcation as 'I' and 'the
world', is no longer there. <i>Es'ev'anto dukkhassa</i>, this, then, is the end
of suffering, <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yo</i>, by hate. He is not dependent,<i> anissito</i>,
on cravings, conceits and views. He is not involved, <i>appa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ibaddho</i>,
with desires and attachments and is released, <i>vippamutto</i>, from
defilements. He is no longer shackled, <i>visa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutto</i>,
by fetters and his mind is free from barriers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What these barriers are, we can
easily infer. They are the bifurcations such as the internal and the external, <i>ajjhatta
bahiddh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, which are so basic to what is called
existence, <i>bhava</i>. Where there are barriers, there are also attachments,
aversions and conflicts. Where there is a fence, there is defence and offence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the <i>arahant </i>dwells with
a mind unpartitioned and barrierless, <i>vimariy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dikatena
cetas<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. To be able to make such a statement is
the highest standard of giving evidence in regard to the four noble usages. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is also noteworthy that in the <i>B<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i> the Buddha has presented the triple
training of higher morality, higher concentration and higher wisdom, <i>adhis<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>la, adhicitta </i>and <i>adhipaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
through these four noble usages. The commentary, too, accepts this fact.<a

But this is a point that might need clarification. How are we to distinguish
between morality, concentration and wisdom in this brief exhortation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now how does the exhortation
begin? It opens with the words <i>tasm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tiha te, B<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;well then, <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i>,
you should train yourself thus.&quot; This is an indication that the Buddha
introduced him to a course of training, and this is the preliminary training: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
be just the cognized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is hinted at by this initial
instruction is the training in higher morality, <i>adhis<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>lasikkh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. The most important aspect of this training is the
morality of sense-restraint, <i>indriya sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>vara s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>la</i>. The first principles of sense-restraint are
already implicit in this brief instruction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If one stops short at just the
seen in regard to the seen, one does not grasp a sign in it, or dwell on its
details. There is no sorting out as 'this is good', 'this is bad'. That itself
conduces to sense-restraint. So we may conclude that the relevance of this
brief instruction to the morality of sense-restraint is in its enjoining the
abstention from grasping a sign or dwelling on the details. That is what
pertains to the training in higher morality, <i>adhis<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>lasikkha</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us see how it also serves the
purpose of training in higher concentration. To stop at just the seen in the
seen is to refrain from discursive thought, which is the way to abandon mental
hindrances. It is discursive thought that brings hindrances in its train. So
here we have what is relevant to the training in higher concentration as well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then what about higher wisdom, <i>adhipaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>? Something more specific has to be said in this
concern. What precisely is to be understood by higher wisdom in this context?
It is actually the freedom from imaginings, <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
and proliferation, <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If one stops short at just the
seen in the seen, such ramifications as mentioned in discourses like the <i>M<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>lapariy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yasutta</i> do not
come in at all. The tendency to objectify the seen and to proliferate it as 'in
it', 'from it' and 'it is mine' receives no sanction. This course of training
is helpful for the emancipation of the mind from imaginings and proliferations.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

one trains oneself according to the instruction &quot;in the seen there will be

will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will be just the cognized&quot;,
that identification implied by the term <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>

It was after the Buddha had already set out on his alms round that this sermon

worth, the Buddha continued with his alms round. Just then a cow with a young

round with a group of monks, the Buddha saw the corpse of the <i>arahant</i> <i>B<span

saying: &quot;Monks, a co-celibate of yours has passed away.&quot;</span></p>

interprets the verse as a description of the destination of the <i>arahant</i> <i>B<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya D<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ruc<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>riya</i> after he attained <i>Parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,

connection, the 'place' one goes to in attaining <i>Parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
That place, according to the commentary, is not easily understood by
worldlings. Its characteristics are said to be the following: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The four elements, earth, water,
fire and air, are not there. No sun, or moon, or stars are there. The reason
why the four elements are negated is supposed to be the fact that there is
nothing that is compounded in the uncompounded <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>element, into which the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;passes away. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Since no sun, or moon, or stars
are there in that mysterious place, one might wonder why there is no darkness
either. The commentator tries to forestall the objection by stating that it is
precisely because one might think that there should be darkness when those
luminaries are not there, that the Buddha emphatically negates it. So the
commentarial interpretation apparently leads us to the conclusion that there is
no darkness in the <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>element, even
though no sun or moon or stars are there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The line of interpretation we have
followed throughout this series of sermons allows us to depart from this
commentarial trend. That place where earth, water, fire and air do not find a
footing is not where the <i>arahant</i> <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya
D<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ruc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>riya</i> had
'gone' when he passed away. The commentator seems to have construed this verse
as a reply the Buddha gave to the question raised by those monks. Their
question was: &quot;Where has he gone after death, what is his after death
state?&quot; They were curious about his borne. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But when we carefully examine the
context, it becomes clear that they raised that question because they did not
know that the corpse they cremated was that of an <i>arahant</i>. Had they
known it, they would not have even asked that question. That is precisely the
reason for the Buddha's declaration that <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i>
attained <i>Parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, a fact he had not
disclosed before. He added that <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i>
followed the path of <i>Dhamma</i> without harassing him with questions and
attained <i>Parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now that is the answer proper. To reveal
the fact that <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i> attained <i>Parinibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is to answer the question put by those
inquisitive monks. Obviously they knew enough of the <i>Dhamma</i> to
understand then, that their question about the borne and destiny of Venerable <i>B<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i> was totally irrelevant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then the verse uttered by the
Buddha in conclusion was something extra. It was only a joyous utterance, a
verse of uplift, coming as a grand finale to the whole episode. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Such verses of uplift are often to
be met with in the <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. As we already mentioned,
the verses in the <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> have to be
interpreted very carefully, because they go far beyond the implications of the
story concerned.<a name="_ednref531"></a><a href="#_edn531" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[531]</span></span></a>
They invite us to take a plunge into the ocean of <i>Dhamma</i>. Just one verse
is enough. The text is small but deep. The verse in question is such a
spontaneous utterance of joy. It is not the answer to the question 'where did
he go?' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Well, in that case, what are we to
understand by the word <i>yattha</i>, &quot;where&quot;? We have already given
a clue to it in our seventh sermon with reference to that non-manifestative
consciousness, <i>anidassana viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>.
What the Buddha describes in this verse, is not the place where the Venerable <i>arahant</i>

To sum up, the attention of the audience in a cinema is directed to the narrow
beam of light falling on the screen. The audience, or the spectators, are
seeing the scenes making up the film show with the help of that beam of light
and the thick darkness around. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This second factor is also very
important. Scenes appear not simply because of the beam of light. The thickness
of the darkness around is also instrumental in it. This fact is revealed when
the cinema hall is fully lit up. If the cinema hall is suddenly illuminated,
either by the opening of doors and windows or by some electrical device, the
scenes falling on the screen fade away as if they were erased. The beam of
light, which was earlier there, becomes dim before the superior light. The
lesser lustre is superseded by a greater lustre. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We might sometimes be found fault
with for harping on this cinema simile, on the ground that it impinges on the
precept concerning abstinence from enjoying dramatic performances, song and
music. But let us consider whether this cinema is something confined to a
cinema hall. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the open air theatre of the
world before us, a similar phenomenon of supersedence is occurring. In the
twilight glow of the evening the twinkling stars enable us to faintly figure
out the objects around us, despite the growing darkness. Then the moon comes
up. Now what happens to the twinkling little stars? They fade away, their
lustre being superseded by that of the moon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then we begin to enjoy the
charming scenes before us in the serene moonlit night. The night passes off.
The day light gleam of the sun comes up. What happens then? The soft radiance
of the moon wanes before the majestic lustre of the sun. The moon gets
superseded and fades away. Full of confidence we are now watching the multitude
of technicoloured scenes in this massive theatre of the world. In broad
daylight, when sunshine is there, we have no doubt about our vision of objects
around us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But now let us suppose that the
extraneous defilements in the mind of a noble disciple, treading the noble
eightfold path, get dispelled, allowing its intrinsic lustre of wisdom to shine
forth. What happens then? The stars, the moon and the sun get superseded by
that light of wisdom. Even the forms that one had seen by twilight, moonlight
and sunlight fade away and pale into insignificance. The umbra of form and the
penumbra of the formless get fully erased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

to mention that form and space are related to each other, like the picture and
its background. Now all this is happening in the firmament, which forms the

darkness. The twilight, the moonlight and the sunlight are but various levels
of that darkness. </span></p>

&quot;Monks, there are these four lustres. What four? The lustre of the moon,
the lustre of the sun, the lustre of fire, the lustre of wisdom. These, monks,
are the four lustres. This, monks, is the highest among these four lustres,
namely the lustre of wisdom.&quot;</span></p>

When one sees forms, one sees them together with their shadows. The fact that
one sees shadows there, is itself proof that darkness has not been fully
dispelled. If light comes from all directions, there is no shadow at all. If
that light is of a penetrative nature, not even form will be manifest there. </span></p>

along the lines of interpretation we have adopted. By way of further proof of
the inadequacy of the commentarial explanation of the references to the sun,
the moon and the stars in this verse, we may draw attention to the following
points. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the commentary the
verse is supposed to express that there are no sun, moon or stars in that
mysterious place called <i>anup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>disesa Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>, which is incomprehensible
to worldlings. We may, however, point out that the verbs used in the verse in
this connection do not convey the sense that the sun, the moon and the stars
are simply non existent there. They have something more to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, with regard to the
stars it is said that there the stars do not shine, <i>na tattha sukk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> jotanti</i>. If in truth and fact stars are not there,
some other verb like <i>na dissanti</i>, &quot;are not seen&quot;, or <i>na
vijjanti</i>, &quot;do not exist&quot;, could have been used. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With reference to the sun and the
moon, also, similar verbs could have been employed. But what we actually find
here, are verbs expressive of spreading light, shining, or appearing beautiful:<i>
Na tattha sukk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> jotanti,</i> &quot;there the stars
do not shine&quot;; <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dicco nappak<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sati,</i> &quot;the sun spreads not its lustre&quot;; <i>na
tattha candim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti,</i>
&quot;the moon does not appear resplendent there&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

statements. The verse in question is a joyous utterance<i>, Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nag<span

depth. There is nothing recondite about it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In our earlier assessment of the
commentarial interpretation we happened to lay special stress on the words
'even though'. We are now going to explain the significance of that emphasis.
For the commentary, the line <i>tamo tattha na vijjati,</i> &quot;no darkness
is to be found there&quot;, is a big riddle. The sun, the moon and the stars
are not there. Even though they are not there, presumably, no darkness is to be
found there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, when we consider the law
of superseding, we have already mentioned, we are compelled to give a totally
different interpretation. The sun, the moon and the stars are not manifest,
precisely because of the light of that non-manifestative consciousness. As it
is lustrous on all sides, <i>sabbato pabha</i>, there is no darkness there and
luminaries like the stars, the sun and the moon do not shine there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

a wealth of information relevant to our topic. Not only the exhortation to <i>B<span

this mind of ours. It is in order to indicate the luminosity of this mind that
the Buddha used those peculiar expressions in this verse of uplift. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What actually happens in the
attainment to the fruit of <i>arahant</i>-hood? The worldling discerns the
world around him with the help of six narrow beams of light, namely the six

go down. This cessation of the six sense-bases could also be referred to as the
cessation of name-and-form, <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mar<span

sense-objects, which the worldling grasps as real and truly existing, get

The task of seeing the spectrum of rainbow colours through a tiny dewdrop
hanging from a creeper or a leaf is one that calls for a high degree of
mindfulness. Simply by standing or sitting with one's face towards the rising
sun, one will not be able to catch a glimpse of the brilliant spectrum of
rainbow colours through the dewdrop. It requires a particular viewpoint. Only when

folded legs, gazing at the Buddha sun, one might not be able to see the six
rainbow colours of the <i>Dhamma</i>. One may be short of just one-hundredth of
an inch as the proper adjustment for right view. Yet it is a must. Once that
adjustment is made, one immediately, then and there, <i>tavad'eva</i>, catches

then, that we have to perfect morality first, then develop concentration, and
only lastly wisdom. One need not think of wisdom before that. But when we come
to the noble eightfold path, we find a different order of values. Here right
view takes precedence. As a matter of fact, in the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>catt<span

Even in a context where the subject is morality, we find a similar statement.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the noble eightfold path, pride
of place is given to right view, which is representative of the wisdom group.
As the well-known definition goes, right view and right thoughts belong to the
wisdom group; right speech, right action and right livelihood come under the
morality group; and right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration
belong to the concentration group. </span></p>

of a tangle, let us try to illustrate the position with some other kind of
tangle. Suppose someone is trying to climb up a long rope, made up of three
strands. As he climbs up, his fingertips might come now in contact with the first
strand, now with the second and now with the third. He is not worried about the
order of the three strands, so long as they are well knit. One can safely climb
up, holding onto the three strands, only when they are firmly wound up into a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the course of our discussion of
the <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i> in our last sermon, we drew
attention to the wide gap that exists between the sensory experience of the
worldling and that experience the <i>arahant</i> gets through the eye of
wisdom. It is the same gap that obtains between the two terms <i>papaÃ±ca</i>
and <i>nippapaÃ±ca</i>. In sensory experience, which is based on worldly
expressions, worldly usages and worldly concepts, there is a discrimination
between a thing to be grasped and the one who grasps, or, in other words, a
subject-object relationship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is always a bifurcation, a
dichotomy, in the case of sensory perception. If there is a seen, there has to
be something seen and the one who sees. That is the logic. In the <i>B<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i>, beginning with 'in the seen there will
be just the seen', the Buddha proclaimed to the ascetic <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiya</i>
a brief exhortation on <i>Dhamma</i> which enables one to transcend the above
narrow view point and attain the state of non-proliferation or <i>nippapaÃ±ca</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is nothing to see, no one to
see, only 'a seen' is there. The cause of all these conceptual proliferation,
or <i>papaÃ±ca</i>, in the world is contact. The <i>arahants</i> understood this
by their insight into the fact that the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized
are simply so many collocations of conditions which come together for a moment
due to contact, only to break up and get dispersed the next moment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is called the seen, the
heard, the sensed and the cognized are for the worldling so many 'things'. But
to the wisdom eye of the <i>arahants</i> they appear as mere conglomerations of
conditions, dependent on contact, which momentarily come together and then get
dispersed. This insight into the dependence on contact, <i>phassam pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca, </i>is the very essence of the law of dependent
arising<i>, pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>.
It is equivalent to seeing the law of dependent arising itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In a certain discourse in the <i>Mucalindavagga
</i>of the <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, the Buddha has declared
in a verse of uplift that the cessation of contact comes about only by doing
away with that which brings about contact. The wandering ascetics of other sects
grew jealous of the Buddha and his congregation of monks, because of their own
loss of gain and honour, and began to hurl abuse on monks in the village and in
the forest. A group of monks came and reported this to the Buddha. The Buddha's
response to it was only a paean of joy. <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>actually
means a spontaneous utterance of joy, and the verse he uttered was such a one.

well. </span></p>

Groups of grasping do not necessarily imply that there are material objects to
be grasped. But the worldling, overcome by that triple proliferation of
cravings, conceits and views, and carried away by the worldly conventions,
imagines those groups of grasping as things grasped and deposited. The concept
of <i>upadhi</i> as assets has arisen as a result of this tendency to think of
groups of grasping as things grasped and deposited. So it turns out to be a
question of viewpoint. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'> is the
relinquishment of all such assets, accumulated in the mind. In order to
relinquish these assets there must be some kind of understanding - an
enlightenment. The vanity of all these assets has to be seen through by the
light of wisdom. It is only by seeing their vanity that the assets are
relinquished. In fact it is not so much a deliberate giving up of assets, as a
sequential liquidation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In a previous sermon we gave an
illustration of the situation that precipitates relinquishment. Let us bring it
up again. We found the cinema quite helpful as an illustration. In explaining
the phenomenon of relinquishment of assets with reference to the cinema, we
described how the assets accumulated in the minds of the audience, that is, the
assets proper to the cinema world woven around the story that is filmed, are
automatically abandoned when the cinema hall gets lit up.<a name="_ednref547"></a><a
href="#_edn547" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[547]</span></span></a> Then one understands the
illusory nature of what has been going on. It is that understanding, that enlightenment,
which precipitates the giving up or relinquishment of assets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To go a step further in this
illustration, when lights came on the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras </i>or preparations pertaining to the film show got
exposed for what they are. In fact, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i> is a word that has associations with the
dramatic tradition in its relation to the acting of actors and actresses down
to their make-up, which is so artificial and spurious. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When the cinema hall gets lit up
all of a sudden, one who has been enjoying the film show is momentarily thrown
out of the cinema world, because those preparations are pacified or nullified, <i>sabba
sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rasamatho</i>.
As a consequence of it, the heap of experiences which he had hitherto regarded
as real and genuine, lose their sanction. Those assets get liquidated or
relinquished, <i>sabb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>padhipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>inissagga</i>.
In their absence, that craving necessary for the appreciation or enjoyment of
the scenes to come becomes extinct, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>hakkhayo</i>.
When craving is gone, the floridity of the scenes to come also fades away, <i>vir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i>. With that fading away or decolouration, the
film show ceases for the person concerned, <i>nirodha</i>, though technically
the movie is going on. Because of that cessation all the fires of defilements
proper to the cinema world, with which he was burning, get extinguished, <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So here we have the full gamut of
the cinema simile as an illustration for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
This kind of awakening in the cinema world gives us a clue to the fact that the
assets, <i>upadhi</i>, are relinquished through an understanding born of
enlightenment in the light of wisdom. This in fact is something that should be
deeply ingrained in our minds. Therefore we shall endeavour to give some more
illustrations to that effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In our everyday life, too, we
sometimes see and hear of instances where assets get relinquished due to
understanding. Someone heaps up a huge bundle of currency notes of the highest
denomination, deposits it in his safe and keeps watch and ward over it day and
night. One fine morning he wakes up to hear that for some reason or other that
currency note has been fully devalued by law the previous night. How does he
look upon the wads of notes in his safe now? For him, it is now a mere heap of
papers. The craving, conceit and view he had earlier in regard to the notes are
completely gone. The bank notes are no longer valid. He might as well make a
bonfire of it. So this is some sort of relinquishment of assets in the world,
however temporary it may be. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Another person gets a sudden
transfer and is getting ready to leave for his new station. His immovable
assets he is forced to leave behind, but his movable assets he hurriedly
gathers up to take with him. The vehicle has already come and is tooting
impatiently, signalling delay. It is well past time, but his 'preparations' are
not finished. Time-pressed, in hot haste, he is running here and there. At
last, when he can delay no longer, he grabs the utmost he can take and darts to
the doorstep. Just then, he wakes up. It was only a dream! The transfer came in
a dream. No real vehicle, no real preparation, only a panting for nothing! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So here we have an 'awakening'
peculiar to the dream world. This is an instance of letting go of assets
connected with a dream. We go through such experiences quite often. Of course,
we take it for granted that when we pass from the dream world to the real
world, the assets proper to the dream world drop off. But are we sure that in
leaving the dream world we are entering a real world? Is awakening from a dream
a true awakening when considered from the point of view of the <i>Dhamma</i>?
Do we actually open our eyes, when we awaken from a dream? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Terms like <i>Buddha</i>, <i>bodhi</i>
and <i>sambodhi</i> convey the sense of awakening as well as understanding.
Sometimes in the <i>Dhamma</i> the emphasis is on the sense of awakening. Here
then is a kind of awakening. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Expressions like <i>dhammacakkhu</i>,
&quot;Dhamma-eye&quot;, <i>paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>cakkhu</i>,
&quot;Wisdom-eye&quot;, and <i>cakkhu<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> udap<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>di</i>, &quot;the eye arose&quot;, bespeak of an
arising of some sort of an eye. We already have eyes, but an eye is said to arise.
All this goes to show that in the context of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
where we are concerned with the deeper aspects of the <i>Dhamma</i>, the
awakening from a dream is not a true awakening. It is only a passage from one
dream world to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But let us see how the concept of <i>upadhi</i>,
or assets, goes deeper. What lies before us is the dream of <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. In order to
awaken from this dream, we have to understand somehow the vanity of all assets
connected with the dream that is <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. The fact that this understanding also comes
through some illumination we have already explained the other day in our
discussion of the paean of joy at the end of the <i>B<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i>.<a
name="_ednref548"></a><a href="#_edn548" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[548]</span></span></a>
As we pointed out then, the world of the six sense-bases which the worldlings
regard as 'their world', when examined against the background of that <i>Ud<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>verse reveals itself to be no more than six
narrow beams of light, appearing through a solidly thick curtain, namely the
darkness of delusion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We happened to mention the other day
that the sun, the moon and the stars shine precisely because of the presence of
darkness. In the non-manifestative consciousness which is infinite and lustrous
all round, <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
anidassana<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
sabbato pabha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, sun, moon and stars are not
manifest, because there is absolutely no darkness for them to shine forth. Even
the formless, which is the penumbra of form, disappears in that penetrative
lustre of wisdom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So the relinquishment of all
assets,<i> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, is not like the other
temporary awakenings already mentioned. Those three instances of awakening are
of a temporary nature. The awakening in the cinema world is extremely short
lived. That film fan, although he became disenchanted with the scenes because
of the unexpected sudden illumination of the cinema hall, when it is dark
again, influxes of sensuality, existence and ignorance so overwhelm him that he
gets engrossed in the cinema world as before. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The case of the devalued currency
note is also like that. Though the cravings, conceits and views about the
devalued note are gone, one still runs after notes that are valid. As for the
awakening from a dream, we all know that it is temporary. When again we go to
sleep, we have dreams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But the awakening in <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is not of such a temporary character. Why?
Because all the influxes that lead one into the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i> slumber with its dreams of recurrent births are
made extinct in the light of that perfect knowledge of realization. That is why
the term <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>savakkhaya</i>, extinction of
influxes, is used in the discourses as an epithet of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
The <i>arahants</i> accomplish this feat in the concentration on the fruit of <i>arahant</i>-hood,
<i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though there are enough instances
of references to this <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>
in the discourses, they are very often interpreted differently. As we have
already seen in the context of that verse of uplift in the <i>B<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hiyasutta</i>, some discourses alluding to the nature
of an <i>arahant's</i> mind have been misinterpreted, so much so that there is
a lot of confusion in regard to the concept of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
As a matter of fact, that concentration peculiar to an <i>arahant</i> is of an
extraordinary type. It baffles the worldling's powers of understanding. This
can well be inferred from the following verse of the <i>Ratanasutta</i>:</span></p>

&quot;unmanifest&quot;, since <i>vibhava </i>is a word which seems to have undergone
some semantic development. However, its primary sense is sufficiently evident
in the <i>Sutta</i> terminology. For instance, the twin term <i>bhava/vibhava</i>
stands for &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;non-existence&quot;. In this
context, too, <i>vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ta </i>seems to have a
negative sense, rather than the sense of being manifest. Hence our rendering:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The general trend of this verse
seems to imply something like this: The worldlings usually believe that one has
to have some form of perception or other. But the one referred to in this verse
is not percipient with any such perception, <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>.
As if to forestall the question, whether he is then in a swoon, there is the
negation <i>na visaÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>. A possible
alternative, like a plane of existence devoid of perception, is also avoided by
the emphatic assertion <i>no pi asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>. Yet
another possibility, that he has gone beyond perception or rescinded it, is
rejected as well with the words <i>na vibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>tasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The third line says that it is to
one thus endowed that form ceases to exist, while the last line seems to give
an indication as to why it is so: <i>SaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nid<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> hi papaÃ±casa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;for
reckonings born of proliferation have perception as their source&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The nature of these reckonings we
have already discussed at length. The conclusion here given is that they are
rooted in <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. Now the passages we have so far quoted are suggestive
of such a state of consciousness. Briefly stated, even the emphatic tone
characteristic of these discourses is sufficient proof of it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, in the first
discourse we took up for discussion, there is the recurrent phrase <i>na jh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yati</i>, &quot;does not muse&quot;, with reference to
all the possible objects of the senses, but at the end of it all comes the
emphatic assertion <i>jh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yati ca pana</i>,
&quot;nevertheless, he does muse&quot;. Similarly the passage dealing with the <i>saÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> aspect starts with <i>neva pathaviya<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pathavisaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>,
&quot;he is neither conscious (literally 'percipient') of earth in earth&quot;,
followed by a long list of negations, only to end up with an emphatic <i>saÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> ca pana assa</i>, &quot;but nevertheless he is
conscious&quot;. So also in the passage which takes up the attending aspect and
winds up with the assertion <i>manasi ca pana kareyya</i>, &quot;and yet he
will be attending&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this evidence is a pointer to the
fact that we have to interpret the reference to the paradoxical state of
consciousness implied by <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> na
visaÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> etc. in the <i>Kalahaviv<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta</i> in the light of that unique concentration
of the <i>arahant - </i>the <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is obvious enough even if we
take into consideration the occurrence of the term <i>papaÃ±casa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> in the last line
of the verse in question. The worldly concepts born of the prolific tendency of
the mind are rooted in perception. That is precisely why perception has to be
transcended. That is also the reason for our emphasis on the need for freedom
from the six sense-bases and from contact. The abandonment of <i>papaÃ±casa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> is accomplished
at this extraordinary level of concentration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The immense importance attached to
the <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i> comes to light in
the passages we have quoted. These discourses are abundant proof of the fact
that the Buddha has extolled this <i>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>
in various ways. The verse beginning with <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>
na visaÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> in particular points to this
fact. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On an earlier occasion we gave
only a clue to its meaning in the form of an allusion to our simile of the
cinema. That is to say, while one is watching a film show, if the cinema hall
is fully illuminated all of a sudden, one undergoes such an internal
transformation, that it becomes questionable whether he is still seeing the
film show. This is because his perception of the film show has undergone a
peculiar change. He is no longer conscious of a film show, nor has he put an
end to consciousness. It is a strange paradox. His gaze is actually a vacant
gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.4pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The verse in question expresses
such a vacant gaze. When the six sense-bases of the <i>arahant</i> cease and
the lustre of wisdom comes up, giving the conviction that all assets in the
world are empty, the vision in the <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>
is as vacant as that gaze of the man at the cinema. It is neither conscious,
nor unconscious, nor non-conscious, nor totally devoid of consciousness. At
that level of concentration even this material form is abandoned. </span></p>

the result that the cinema film has 'ceased' for him and he is 'extinguished'

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

facie. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But, as we pointed out in this
series of sermons, there is the question of the dichotomy between the form and
the formless. The formless, or <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, is
like the shadow of form, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>. Therefore,
when one comprehends form, one also understands that the formless, too, is not
worthwhile settling in. It is in that sense that we brought in the reading <i>asa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7789;</span>hit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> in this
context. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Those who have fully comprehended
form, do not depend on the formless either, and it is they that are released in
the realization of cessation. They transcend the duality of form and formless
and, by directing their minds to the cessation of existence, attain
emancipation. </span></p>

that here there is no touch. So what we have stated above might even appear as
contradictory. The above verse speaks of a 'touching' of the deathless element

is further corroborated by a certain passage in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>yatanvibha<span

In that discourse, which deals with some deeper aspects of the <i>Dhamma</i>,
the concept of <i>nekkhammasita domanassa</i>, or &quot;unhappiness connected
with renunciation&quot;, is explained as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If one contemplates with insight
wisdom the sense-objects like forms and sounds as impermanent,
suffering-fraught and transient, and develops a longing for <i>Nibb<span

feel an unhappiness. It is such an unhappiness which, however, is superior to
an unhappiness connected with the household life, that is called <i>nekkhammasita
domanassa</i>, or &quot;unhappiness connected with renunciation&quot;.</span></p>

the most controversial passage on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
Scholars, both ancient and modern, have put forward various interpretations of
this much vexed passage. Its riddle-like presentation has posed a challenge to
many a philosopher bent on determining what <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This brief discourse comes in the <i>Ud<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>as an inspired utterance of the Buddha on the
subject of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isamyuttasutta</i>.
To begin with, we shall try to give a somewhat literal translation of the
passage:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Monks, there is that sphere,
wherein there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor air; neither the
sphere of infinite space, nor the sphere of infinite consciousness, nor the
sphere of nothingness, nor the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception;
neither this world nor the world beyond, nor the sun and the moon. There,
monks, I say, is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away and no arising;
it is not established, it is not continuing, it has no object. This, itself, is
the end of suffering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Instead of getting down to the
commentarial interpretation at the very outset, let us try to understand this
discourse on the lines of the interpretation we have so far developed. We have
already come across two references to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
as an <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana </i>or a sphere. In the present
context, too, the term <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i> is an
allusion to <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>. Its
significance, therefore, is psychological. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>First of all we are told that
earth, water, fire and air are not there in that <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i>.
This is understandable, since in a number of discourses dealing with <i>anidassana
viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a </i>and <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i> we came across similar statements. It is said
that in <i>anidassana viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>,<i> </i>or
non-manifestative consciousness, earth, water, fire and air do not find a
footing. Similarly, when one is in <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>,
one is said to be devoid of the perception of earth in earth, for instance,
because he does not attend to it. So the peculiar negative formulation of the
above <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>passage is suggestive of the
fact that these elements do not exercise any influence on the mind of one who
is in <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The usual interpretation, however,
is that it describes some kind of a place or a world devoid of those elements.
It is generally believed that the passage in question is a description of the
'sphere' into which the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;passes away, that is, his after
death 'state'. This facile explanation is often presented only as a tacit
assumption, for fear of being accused of heretical views. But it must be
pointed out that the allusion here is to a certain level of experience of the
living <i>arahant</i>, namely the realization, here and now, of the cessation
of existence, <i>bhavanirodha</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The four elements have no part to
play in that experience. The sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite
consciousness etc. also do not come in, as we have already shown with reference
to a number of discourses. So it is free from both form and formless. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The statement that there is
neither this world nor a world beyond could be understood in the light of the
phrase, <i>na idhaloke idhalokasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>, na paraloke
paralokasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>, &quot;percipient neither of a
this world in this world, nor of a world beyond in a world beyond&quot; that
came up in a passage discussed above. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The absence of the moon and the
sun, <i>na ubho candima s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>riy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
in this sphere, is taken as the strongest argument in favour of concluding that
<i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is some kind of a place, a place
where there is no moon or sun. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But as we have explained in the
course of our discussion of the term <i>anidassana viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>,
or non-manifestative consciousness, with the cessation of the six
sense-spheres, due to the all lustrous nature of the mind, sun and moon lose
their lustre, though the senses are all intact. Their lustre is superseded by
the lustre of wisdom. They pale away and fade into insignificance before it. It
is in this sense that the moon and the sun are said to be not there in that
sphere. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why there is no coming, no going,
no staying, no passing away and no arising, can be understood in the light of
what we have observed in earlier sermons on the question of relative concepts.
The verbal dichotomy characteristic of worldly concepts is reflected in this
reference to a coming and a going etc. The <i>arahant </i>in <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i> is free from the limitations imposed by this
verbal dichotomy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The three terms <i>appati<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, appavatta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>&nbsp;and <i>an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;not
established&quot;, &quot;not continuing&quot; and &quot;objectless&quot;, are
suggestive of the three doorways to deliverance. <i>Appati<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> refers to <i>appa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ihita
vimokkha</i>, &quot;undirected deliverance&quot;, which comes through the
extirpation of craving. <i>Appavatta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> stands
for <i>suÃ±Ã±ata vimokkha</i>, the &quot;void deliverance&quot;, which is the
negation of continuity. <i>An<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> is clearly enough
a reference to <i>animitta vimokkha</i>, the &quot;signless deliverance&quot;.
Not to have an object is to be signless. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The concluding sentence &quot;this
itself is the end of suffering&quot; is therefore a clear indication that the end
of suffering is reached here and now. It does not mean that the <i>arahant</i>
gets half of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;here and the
other half 'there'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Our line of interpretation leads
to such a conclusion, but of course, in case there are shortcomings in it, we
could perhaps improve on it by having recourse to the commentarial
interpretation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now as to the commentarial
interpretation, this is how the <i>Ud<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;commentary
explains the points we have discussed:<a name="_ednref591"></a><a
href="#_edn591" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[591]</span></span></a> It paraphrases the term <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i> by <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a</i>, observing that it means reason in this context.
Just as much as forms stand in relation of an object to the eye, so the <i>asa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>, or the
&quot;unprepared element&quot;, is said to be an object to the <i>arahant's </i>mind,
and here it is called <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then the commentary raises the
question, why earth, water, fire and air are not there in that <i>asa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>. The four
elements are representative of things prepared, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>.
There cannot be any mingling or juxtaposition between the <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i> and the <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>.
That is why earth, water, fire and air are not supposed to be there, in that <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The question why there are no
formless states, like the sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite
consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
is similarly explained, while asserting that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>is nevertheless formless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Since in <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>one has transcended the sensuous sphere, <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>maloka</i>,
the concepts of a this world and a world beyond are said to be irrelevant. As
to why the sun and the moon are not there, the commentary gives the following
explanation: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In realms of form there is
generally darkness, to dispel which there must be a sun and a moon. But <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is not a realm of form, so how could sun and
moon come in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then what about the reference to a
coming, a going, a staying, a passing away and an arising? No one comes to <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> from anywhere and no one goes out from it, no
one stays in it or passes away or reappears in it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now all this is mystifying enough.
But the commentary goes on to interpret the three terms <i>appati<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, appavatta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>&nbsp;and <i>an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> also in the same
vein. Only that which has form gets established and <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>is formless, therefore it is not established anywhere. <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> does not continue, so it is <i>appavatta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, or non-continuing. Since <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> takes no object, it is objectless, <i>an<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ramma<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.
It is as good as saying that, though one may take <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
as an object, <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>itself takes no
object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So this is what the traditional interpretation
amounts to. If there are any shortcomings in our explanation, one is free to go
for the commentarial. But it is obvious that there is a lot of confusion in
this commentarial trend. Insufficient appreciation of the deep concept of the
cessation of existence seems to have caused all this confusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>More often than otherwise,
commentarial interpretations of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
leaves room for some subtle craving for existence, <i>bhavata<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. It gives a vague idea of a place or a sphere, <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yatana</i>, which serves as a surrogate destination for
the <i>arahants</i> after their demise. Though not always explicitly asserted,
it is at least tacitly suggested. The description given above is ample proof of
this trend. It conjures up a place where there is no sun and no moon, a place
that is not a place. Such confounding trends have crept in probably due to the
very depth of this <i>Dhamma</i>. </span></p>

extreme attitudes. Whereas in ordinary concentration <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span

control as the term <i>vikkhambhana</i>, &quot;propping up&quot;,

steadfastness, for the unwavering firmness to stand one's ground. So, the

The steadfastness associated with the epithet <i>t<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span

received acceptance in the commentarial period. In the course of our last
sermon, we made it very clear that some of the discourses cited by the
commentators in support of that view deal, on the contrary, with some kind of
realization the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;goes through here and now, in this very

cessation of the six sense-spheres.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, as for the first two lines,
the high and low paths refer to the modes of practice adopted, according to the
grades of understanding in different character types. For instances, the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The problem lies in the last two
lines. The commentary tries to tackle it by interpreting the reference to not
going twice to the farther shore, <i>na p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> digu<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

href="#_edn605" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[605]</span></span></a> The implication is that the
supramundane path of a stream-winner, a once-returner or a non-returner arises
only once. Why it is not to be conceived as a going once is explained as an acceptance
of the norm that requires not less than four supramundane paths to attain <i>arahant</i>-hood.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, a deeper analysis of the
verse in question would reveal the fact that it effectively brings up an
apparent contradiction. The commentary sidetracks by resolving it into two
different problems. The two lines simply reflect two aspects of the same
problem. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>They go not twice to the farther
shore, and this not going twice, <i>na ida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
is however not to be thought of as a 'going once' either. The commentary
sidetracks by taking <i>ida<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, 'this', to mean
the farther shore, <i>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
whereas it comprehends the whole idea of not going twice. Only then is the
paradox complete. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In other words, this verse
concerns the such-like one, the <i>arahant</i>, and not the stream-winner, the
once-returner or the non-returner. Here we have an echo of the idea already
expressed as the grand finale of the <i>Parama<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hakasutta</i>:
<i>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>gato na

</i><a name="_ednref606"></a><a href="#_edn606" title=""><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[606]</span></a></span> the such-like one, &quot;gone
to the farther shore, comes not back&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the last line, however, that
remains a puzzle. Why is this 'not going twice,' not to be thought of as a
'going once'? There must be something deep behind this riddle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, when one says
'I won't go there twice', it means that he will go only once. When one says 'I
won't tell twice', it follows that he will tell only once. But here we are told
that the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;goes not twice, and yet it is not a going once. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The idea behind this riddle is
that the influx-free <i>arahant</i>, the such-like-one, gone to the farther
shore, which is supramundane, does not come back to the mundane. Nevertheless,
he apparently comes back to the world and is seen to experience likes and
dislikes, pleasures and pains, through the objects of the five senses. From the
point of view of the worldling, the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;has come back to the
world. This is the crux of the problem. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why is it not to be conceived of
as a going once? Because the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;has the ability to detach himself
from the world from time to time and re-attain to that <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>. It is true that he too experiences the objects
of the five external senses, but now and then he brings his mind to dwell in
that <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi, </i>which is like
standing on the farther shore. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here, then, we have an extremely
subtle problem. When the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;comes back to the world and is
seen experiencing the objects of the five senses, one might of course conclude
that he is actually 'in the world'. This problematic situation, namely the
question how the influx-free<i> arahant</i>, gone to the farther shore, comes
back and takes in objects through the senses, the Buddha resolves with the help
of a simple simile, drawn from nature. For instance, we read in the <i>Jar<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta</i>&nbsp;of the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>
the following scintillating lines.</span></p>

from the <i>Uragasutta</i> which has the same refrain, because of its relevance
to the understanding of the term <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. The transcendence of
relativity involves freedom from the duality in worldly concepts such as 'good'
and 'evil'. The concept of a 'farther shore' stands relative to the concept of
a 'hither shore'. The point of these discourses is to indicate that there is a
freedom from worldly conceptual proliferations based on duality and relativity.
The verse we propose to bring up is:</span></p>

significant in that it brings out some points of interest. The overreaching and
lagging behind is an allusion to the verbal dichotomy. In the context of views,
for instance, annihilationism is an overreaching and eternalism is a lagging
behind. We may give another illustration, easier to understand. Speculation
about the future is an overreaching and repentance over the past is a lagging
behind. To transcend both these tendencies is to get beyond proliferation, <i>sabba<span

and <i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i> have to be explained. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A lot of confusion has arisen, due
to a misunderstanding of the meaning of these two terms in this particular
context. The usual commentarial exegesis on the term <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammika</i>
amounts to this: <i>Imasmi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> attabh<span

is, in the present&quot;. It seems all right. But then for <i>sampar<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ye khandhabhedato parabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ge</i>,
&quot;<i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>&nbsp;means after the
breaking up of the aggregates&quot;. The implication is that it refers to the <i>arahant's</i>
after death state. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Are we then to conclude that the <i>arahant</i>
gets half of his <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;here and the
other half hereafter? The terms <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammika</i>
and <i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i>, understood in their
ordinary sense, would point to such a conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But let us not forget that the
most distinctive quality of this <i>Dhamma</i> is associated with the highly
significant phrase, <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hevadhamme</i>,

How can we reconcile these two passages?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the context of <i>kamma</i>,
the meaning of the two terms in question can easily be understood. For
instance, that category of <i>kamma</i>&nbsp;known as <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammavedan<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ya</i> refers to those actions which produce their
results here and now. <i>Sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i>&nbsp;pertains
to what comes after death, as for instance in the phrase <i>sampar<span

hereafter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

that the term <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammika</i> is associated

must not be forgotten. If <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na&nbsp;</i>is
the cessation of existence, there is nothing left for the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;to

solely the realization of the cessation of existence or the end of the process of
becoming. So there is absolutely no question of a hereafter for the <i>arahant</i>.
By way of clarification, we have to revert to the primary sense of the term <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. We have made it sufficiently clear that <i>Nibb<span

irrelevant. If the idea of an extinguishment of a fire is brought in, the whole
problem is solved. Think of a blazing fire. If no more firewood is added to it,
the flames would subside and the embers would go on smouldering before turning
into ashes. This is the norm. Now this is not an analogy we are superimposing

feelings in a way that baffles <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. </span></p>

Outwardly it might appear as an act of self-immolation, which indeed is painful.

This is the nineteenth sermon in the series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Towards the end of our last sermon,
we started commenting on the two terms <i>sa-up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu </i>and <i>anup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>. Our discussion was based on a discourse, which
we quoted from the <i>Itivuttaka</i>. We also drew attention to a certain analogy
found in the discourses, which shows that the two <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>elements actually represent two stages of the extinguishment implicit in
the term <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When no more firewood is added to
a blazing fire, flames would subside and the logs of wood already burning go on
smouldering as embers. After some time, they too get extinguished and become
ashes. With regard to the <i>arahant</i>, too, we have to think in terms of
this analogy. It can be taken as an illustration of the two <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;elements. To the extent the living <i>arahant</i>
is free from fresh graspings, lust, hate and delusions do not flare up. But so
long as he has to bear the burden of this organic combination, this physical
frame, the <i>arahant</i> has to experience certain afflictions and be
receptive to likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In spite of all that, mentally he
has access to the experience of the extinguishment he has already won. It is in
that sense that the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;is said to be in the <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;element with residual clinging in his
everyday life, while taking in the objects of the five senses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At the last moment of the <i>arahant's
</i>life, even this organic body that had been grasped as <i>up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a</i> has to be
abandoned. It is at that moment, when he is going to detach his mind from the
body, that <i>anup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>
comes in. A brief hint to this effect is given in one of the verses occurring
in the <i>N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gasutta</i>&nbsp;referred to earlier.
The verse runs thus:</span></p>

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> elements this way, a more difficult problem
confronts us relating to the sense in which they are called <i>di<span

<i>Di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hadhammika</i>&nbsp;means what
pertains to this life and <i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i>

the meaning of these two terms is easily understood. But when it comes to <i>Nibb<span

two types of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic</i>&nbsp;bliss, one to be
experienced here and the other hereafter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But that kind of explanation would
not accord with the spirit of this <i>Dhamma</i>, because the Buddha always
emphasizes the fact that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is
something to be realized here and now in toto. It is not a piecemeal
realization, leaving something for the hereafter. Such terms like <i>di<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>heva dhamme</i>, in this very life, <i>sandi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hika</i>, here and now, and <i>ak<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the context of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, these two terms have to be understood as
representing two aspects of a perfect realization attainable in this very life.
Briefly stated, <i>anup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i> is
that which confers the certitude, well in time, that the appeasement
experienced by an <i>arahant</i> during this life time remains unchanged even
at death. To say that there is a possibility of realizing or ascertaining one's
state after death might even seem contradictory. How can one realize one's
after death state?</span></p>

feelings, the origin of feelings, and the point at which they surcease and the
way leading to their extinction. With the extinction of feelings, that monk is
hunger-less and perfectly extinguished. The reference here is to that bliss of <i>Nibb<span

mentioned here is not to be understood as the death of the <i>arahant</i>. In

to the living <i>arahant</i>. Only in the commentaries we find a distinction
made in this respect. The <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;of
the living <i>arahant </i>is called <i>kilesaparinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
the perfect extinguishment of the defilements, while what comes at the last

was probably the semantic development the term <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;had
undergone in the course of time. The fact that this perfect extinguishment is
essentially psychological seems to have been ignored with the passage of time.
That is why today, on hearing the word <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
one is immediately reminded of the last moment of the life of the Buddha or of
an <i>arahant</i>. In the discourses, however, <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is
clearly an experience of the living <i>arahant</i> in his <i>arahattaphalasam<span

&quot;he understands that all what is felt will cool off here itself&quot;. It

the feeling which comes at the termination of one's life. For the <i>arahant</i>,
the <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi </i>stands in good
stead, particularly at the moment of death. That is why it is called <i>akupp<span

of the mind. This is a description of how the Buddha attained <i>parinibb<span

verses,&nbsp; the commentarial exegesis seems to have gone at a tangent at this
point. Commenting on the last two lines of the first verse, the commentary
observes: <i>Buddhamuni santi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> gamiss<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ti, santi<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is some discrepancy in this
explanation. Commentators themselves usually give quite a different sense to
the word <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rabbha</i> than the one implicit in
this explanation. Here it means &quot;for the sake of&quot;. It is for the sake
of that peace that the Buddha is said to have passed away. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In such commentaries as <i>J<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taka-a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hakath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> and <i>Dhammapada-a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hakath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, commentators do not use the word <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rabbha</i> in the introductory episodes in this sense.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> </span>There it only means &quot;in connection
with&quot;, indicating the origin of the story, as suggested by the
etymological background of the word itself. When for instance it is said that
the Buddha preached a particular sermon in connection with <i>Devadatta Thera</i>,
it does not necessarily mean that it was meant for him.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a name="_ednref654"></a><a href="#_edn654" title=""><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[654]</span></a></span> He may not have been there at
all, it may be that he was already dead by that time. The term <i><span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rabbha</i>&nbsp;in such contexts only means that it was
in connection with him. It can refer to a person or an incident, as the point
of origin of a particular sermon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Granted this, we have to explain
the verse in question not as an allusion to the fact that the Buddha, the sage,
passed away for the sake of that peace with the idea 'I will attain to that
state of peace'. It only means that the Buddha, the sage, passed away having
brought his mind into that state of peace. In other words, according to the
commentary the passing away comes first and the peace later, but according to
the <i>sutta</i>&nbsp;proper, peace comes first and the passing away later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a crucial point involved
in this commentarial divergence. It has the presumption that the Buddha passed
away in order to enter into 'that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>element'.
This presumption is evident quite often in the commentaries. When hard put to
it, the commentaries sometimes concede the <i>sutta's</i>&nbsp;standpoint, but
more often than otherwise they follow a line of interpretation that comes
dangerously close to an eternalist point of view, regarding <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here too the commentarial
exegesis, based on the term <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rabbha</i>, runs the
same risk. On the other hand, as we have pointed out, the reference here is to
the fact that the Buddha adverted his mind to that peace well before the onset
of death, whereby <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra's</i>&nbsp;attempt is
foiled, because feelings are already cooled off. It is here that the
unshakeable deliverance of the mind proves its worth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a 'real'-ization it is already
available to the Buddha and the <i>arahants</i>&nbsp;in the <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, and when the time comes, they put forward this
experience to beat off <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. That is why we
find a string of epithets for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, such
as <i>t<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,

When faced with death, or the pain of death, it gives 'protection'<i>, t<span

shelter, like a 'cave',<i> le<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.
It is the 'island', <i>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
within easy reach. It is the 'refuge',&nbsp;<i>sara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, and the 'resort', <i>par<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yana<span

and above all the 'deathless', <i>amata<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.
This deathlessness they experience in this very world, and when death comes,
this realization stands them in good stead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why Venerable <i>Anuruddha</i>
brought in the profane concept of death with the expression <i>k<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lamakari</i> into this verse, describing the Buddha's <i>parinibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, is also a question that should arrest our
attention. This particular expression is generally used in connection with the
death of ordinary people. Why did he use this expression in such a hallowed
context? It is only to distinguish and demarcate the deliverance of the mind,
couched in the phrase <i>vimokkho cetaso ahu, </i>from the phenomenon of death
itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddhas and <i>arahants</i>
also abandon this body, like other beings. The expression <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lamakari</i>,
&quot;made an end of time&quot;, is an allusion to this phenomenon. In fact, it
is only the Buddhas and <i>arahants</i> who truly make an 'end' of time, being
fully aware of it. Therefore the most important revelation made in the last two
lines of the first verse, <i>anejo santim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rabbha,
ya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lamakar<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> muni</i>, is the fact that the Buddha passed away
having brought his mind to the peace of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to prove that an <i>arahant</i>,
even here and now in this very life, has realized his after death state, which
is none other than the birthless cessation of all forms of existence that
amounts to deathlessness itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In all other religions immortality
is something attainable after death. If one brings down the Buddha's <i>Dhamma</i>&nbsp;also
to that level, by smuggling in the idea of an everlasting <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, it too will suffer the same fate. That would
contradict the teachings on impermanence, <i>aniccat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
and insubstantiality, <i>anattat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But here we have an entirely
different concept. It is a case of overcoming the critical situation of death
by directing one's mind to a concentration that nullifies the power of <i>M<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. So it becomes clear that the two terms<i> sa-up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> parinibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu </i>and <i>anup<span

aspects of the same <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khatadh<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a matter of fact, <i>arahants</i>&nbsp;have
already directly realized, well in time, their after death state. That is to say,
not only have they gone through the experience of extinguishment here and now,
but they are also assured of the fact that this extinguishment is irreversible
even after death, since all forms of existence come to cease. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is an innovation, the importance
of which can hardly be overestimated. Here the Buddha has transcended even the
dichotomy between the two terms <i>sandi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hika</i>&nbsp;and
<i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i>. Generally, the world is
inclined to believe that one can be assured only of things pertaining to this
life. In fact, the word <i>sandi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hika</i>&nbsp;literally
means that one can be sure only of things visible here and now. Since one
cannot be sure of what comes after death, worldlings are in the habit of
investing faith in a particular teacher or in a god. </span></p>

illustration of the first principle we have outlined earlier. Where there is
knowledge born of personal experience, there is no need of faith. Faith is
displaced by knowledge of realization. It is where one has no such experiential
knowledge that faith comes in. That is why <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ha</i>
confesses that he has faith in the fifth fruit of giving. With regard to the
first four, faith is something redundant for him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is a verse attributed to the
Buddha that comes in the <i>Arahantavagga</i>&nbsp;of the <i>Dhammapada</i>,
which puns upon some words. Such riddle verses follow the pattern of a figure
of speech called double entendr<span lang=ZH-TW>â</span>, which makes use of
ambiguous words. The above verse sounds blasphemous on the first hearing. The
Buddha is said to have employed this device to arrest the listener's attention.
The surface meaning seems to go against the <i>Dhamma</i>, but it provokes
deeper reflection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, <i>assaddho</i>&nbsp;means
faithless, to be <i>akataÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i>&nbsp;is to be
ungrateful, <i>sandhicchedo</i> is a term for a housebreaker, <i>hat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>so</i>&nbsp;is a
hopeless case with no opportunities, <i>vant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>so</i>&nbsp;means
greedy of vomit. So the surface meaning amounts to this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;That faithless ungrateful
man,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Who is a housebreaker,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

supreme.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For the deeper meaning the words
have to be construed differently. <i>Assaddho</i>&nbsp; implies&nbsp;
that&nbsp; level of&nbsp; penetration&nbsp; into&nbsp; truth&nbsp; at&nbsp;
which&nbsp; faith </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>becomes
redundant. <i>Akata</i>, the unmade, is an epithet for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
and <i>akataÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i>&nbsp;is one who knows the
unmade. <i>Sandhicchedo </i>means one who has cut off the connecting links to <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. <i>Hat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>so</i> refers to that
elimination of opportunities for rebirth. <i>Vant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>so</i>
is a term for one who has vomited out desires. The true meaning of the verse,
therefore, can be summed up as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;That man who has outgrown
faith, as he is a knower of the&nbsp;&nbsp; unmade,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Who has sundered all shackles to
existence and destroyed all possibilities of rebirth,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>He indeed is the man
supreme.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The description, then, turns out
to be that of an <i>arahant</i>. <i>Assaddho</i> as an epithet for the <i>arahant</i>
follows the same norm as the epithet <i>asekho</i>. <i>Sekha</i>, meaning
&quot;learner&quot;, is a term applied to those who are training for the
attainment of <i>arahant</i>-hood, from the stream-winner, <i>sot<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>panna</i>, upwards. Literally, <i>asekha</i>&nbsp;could
be rendered as&nbsp; &quot;unlearned&quot; or &quot;untrained&quot;. But it is
certainly not in that sense that an <i>arahant</i> is called <i>asekha</i>. He
is called <i>asekha </i>in the sense that he is no longer in need of that
training, that is to say, he is an adept. <i>Assaddho</i>, too, has to be
construed similarly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we have mentioned before, the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;has
already realized the cessation of existence in his <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, thereby securing the knowledge of the unmade, <i>akata</i>,
or the unprepared, <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. The term <i>akataÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span></i> highlights that fact of realization. The most
extraordinary and marvellous thing about the realization of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is that it gives an assurance not only of
matters pertaining to this life, <i>sandi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hika</i>,
but also of what happens after death, <i>sampar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yika</i>

realization here and now of the cessation of existence, <i>bhavanirodho nibb<span

the assurance that there is no more existence after death. So there is only one
<i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khatadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>.
The verse we already quoted, too, ends with the words <i>paha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>su

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>One thing should be clear now.
Though there are two <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>elements
called<i> sa-up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dises<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nadh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu </i>as a place of eternal rest for the <i>arahants</i>&nbsp;after
death - an everlasting immortal state. The deathlessness of <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is to be experienced in this world itself. That
is why an <i>arahant</i> is said to feast on ambrosial deathlessness, <i>amata<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> paribhuÃ±jati</i>,<i> </i>when he is in <i>arahattaphalasam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>. When it is time for death, he brings his mind
to this <i>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, and it is while he is
partaking of ambrosial deathlessness that <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>&nbsp;quietly
takes away his body. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>An <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;might even
cremate his own body, as if it is another's. Now we are at an extremely deep
point in this <i>Dhamma</i>. We have to say something in particular about the
two terms <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i> and <i>asa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. In our last sermon, we happened to give a
rather unusual explanation of such pair-wise terms like the 'hither shore' and
the 'farther shore', as well as the 'mundane' and the 'supramundane'. The two
terms in each pair are generally believed to be far apart and the gap between
them is conceived in terms of time and space. But we compared this gap to that
between the lotus leaf and the drop of water on it, availing ourselves of a
simile offered by the Buddha himself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The distance between the lotus
leaf and the drop of water on it is the same as that between the hither shore
and the farther shore, between the mundane and the supramundane. This is no
idle sophistry, but a challenge to deeper reflection. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The <i>Dhammapada </i>verse we
quoted earlier beginning with <i>yassa p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra<span

&quot;to whom there is neither a farther shore nor a hither shore nor
both&quot;, is puzzling enough. But what it says is that the <i>arahant</i> has
transcended both the hither shore and the farther shore. It is as if he has
gone beyond this shore and the other shore as well, that is to say, he has
transcended the dichotomy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have to say something similar
with regard to the two terms <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>&nbsp;and
<i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>. <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>,
or the prepared, is like a floral design. This prepared floral design, which is
<i>bhava</i>, or existence, is made up, as it were, with the help of the glue
of craving, the tangles of views and the knots of conceits. If one removes the
glue, disentangles the tangles and unties the knots, the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>,
or the prepared, itself becomes <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>,
the unprepared, then and there. The same floral design, which was the <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>, has now become the <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>.
This itself is the cessation of existence, <i>bhavanirodho</i>. When one can
persuade oneself to think of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> as an
extinguishment, the term <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> can
well be understood as 'perfect extinguishment'. </span></p>

uttered a paean of joy. Venerable <i>Dabba Mallaputta</i> was an <i>arahant</i>,
gifted with marvellous psychic powers, specializing in miracles performed by
mastering the fire element, <i>tejo dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>. His

commentary gives two alternative meanings, probably because it is in doubt as
to the correct one. Firstly it brings in the idea of a bronze vessel that is
being beaten at the forge with an iron hammer, giving the option that the
gradual subsidence mentioned in the verse may apply either to the flames or to
the reverberations of sound arising out of it.<a name="_ednref662"></a><a

one gets a notion of compactness, as on seeing a red hot block of solid iron. </span></p>

&quot;better to swallow a red hot iron ball, that resembles a flame of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All in all, it is highly
significant that the Buddha uttered three verses of uplift in connection with
the <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;of the <i>arahant</i>
Venerable <i>Dabba Mallaputta</i>. The most important point that emerges from
this discussion is that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is essentially
an extinction or extinguishment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>An extinguished fire goes nowhere.
In the case of other<i> arahants</i>, who were cremated after their <i>parinibb<span

perpetuate at least the memory of their existence. But here Venerable <i>Dabba
Mallaputta</i>, as if to drive a point home, through his psychic powers based
on the fire element, saw to it that neither ashes nor soot will mar his perfect
extinguishment in the eyes of the world. That is why the Buddha celebrated it
with these special utterances of joy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then the cessation of existence
is itself <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. There is no everlasting

their <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That kind of argument the
commentaries sometimes put forward is now and then advanced by modern day
writers and preachers, too, in their explanations. When it comes to <i>Nibb<span

origin, the parable of the tortoise and the parable of the frog. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the former, a tortoise goes down
into the water and the fishes ask him where he came from. The tortoise replies
that he came from land. In order to determine what sort of a thing land is, the
fishes go on asking the tortoise a number of questions based on various
qualities of water. To each question the tortoise has to reply in the negative,
since land has none of the qualities of water. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The parable of the frog is much
the same. When it gets into water it has to say 'no no' to every question put
by the toad, still unfamiliar with land. To make the parables convincing, those
negative answers, the 'no-nos', are compared to the strings of negative terms
that are found in the <i>sutta</i>&nbsp;passages dealing with the <i>arahattaphalasam<span

that those passages do not in any way refer to a non-descript realm into which

teachings on the cessation of existence, dependent arising and not self. They
create a lot of misconceptions regarding <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
as the ultimate aim. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The purpose of all those arguments
is to assert that <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;is
definitely not an annihilation. The ideal of an everlasting <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is held out in order to obviate nihilistic
notions. But the Buddha himself has declared that when he is preaching about
the cessation of existence, those who held on to eternalist views wrongly
accused him for being an annihilationist, who teaches about the annihilation,
destruction and non-existence of a truly existing being, <i>sato satassa

not in any way incline towards eternalism in order to defend himself. He did
not put forward the idea of an everlasting <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;to
counter the accusation. Instead, he drew attention to the three signata and the
four noble truths and solved the whole problem. He maintained that the charge
is groundless and utterly misconceived, and concluded with the memorable
declaration: <i>pubbe c<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Even the term <i>tath<span

self. It is only a mass of suffering that has come down through <i>sa<span

ignorance. The so-called existence, <i>bhava</i>, is an outcome of grasping, <i>up<span

ceases, existence comes to an end. That itself is the cessation of existence, <i>bhavanirodha</i>,

of the cessation of existence. It is only when one is grasping something that
he can be identified with it, or reckoned by it. When one lets go of everything,
he goes beyond reckoning. Of course, even the commentaries sometimes use the

this account with the confession that he himself was perplexed and was in doubt

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With this sentence the discourse
ends abruptly, but there is an intricate point in the two sections quoted
above. In these two sections, we have adopted the reading <i>anuppatto</i>,
&quot;has reached&quot;, as more plausible in rendering the phrase <i>aÃ±Ã±atara<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yam anuppatto</i>,
&quot;has reached a certain body&quot;.<a name="_ednref684"></a><a
href="#_edn684" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[684]</span></span></a> The commentary, however, seeks
to justify the reading <i>anupapanno</i>, &quot;is not reborn&quot;, which
gives quite an opposite sense, with the following explanation <i>cutikkha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>eyeva pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isandhicittassa
anuppannatt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> anuppanno hoti</i>,<a

&quot;since at the death moment itself, the rebirth consciousness has not yet
arisen, he is said to be not yet reborn&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some editors doubt whether the
correct reading should be <i>anuppatto</i>.<a name="_ednref686"></a><a
href="#_edn686" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[686]</span></span></a> The doubt seems reasonable
enough, for even syntactically, <i>anuppatto</i> can be shown to fit into the
context better than <i>anuppanno</i>. The word <i>aÃ±Ã±atara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;
</span></i>provides us with the criterion. It has a selective sense, like
&quot;a certain&quot;, and carries definite positive implications. To express
something negative a word like <i>aÃ±Ã±a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
&quot;another&quot;, has to be used instead of the selective <i>aÃ±Ã±atara<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;a certain&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;On the other hand, the
suggested reading <i>anuppatto</i> avoids those syntactical difficulties. A
being lays down this body and has reached a certain body. Even the simile given
as an illustration is in favour of our interpretation. The original question of
<i>Vaccha</i> about the flame flung by the wind, reminds us of the way a forest
fire, for instance, spreads from one tree to another tree some distance away.
It is the wind that pushes the flame for it to catch hold of the other tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The commentarial explanation,
however, envisages a situation in which a being lays down this body and is not
yet reborn in another body. It is in the interim that craving is supposed to be
the grasping or a fuel. Some scholars have exploited this commentarial
explanation to postulate a theory of <i>antar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhava</i>,
or interim existence, prior to rebirth proper. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Our interpretation, based on the
reading <i>anuppatto</i>, rules out even the possibility of an <i>antar<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhava</i>. Obviously enough, <i>Vacchagotta's </i>question
is simple and straightforward. He is curious to know what sort of a grasping
connects up the being that lays down the body and the being that arises in
another body. That is to say, how the apparent gap could be bridged. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The answer given by the Buddha
fully accords with the analogy envisaged by the premise. Just as the wind does
the work of grasping in the case of the flame, so craving itself, at the moment
of death, fulfils the function of grasping for a being to reach another body.
That is precisely why craving is called <i>bhavanetti</i>, &quot;the guide in
becoming&quot;.<a name="_ednref687"></a><a href="#_edn687" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[687]</span></span></a>
Like a promontory, it juts out into the ocean of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. When it comes to rebirth, it is craving that
bridges the apparent gap. It is the invisible combustible fuel that keeps the
raging <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>forest
fire alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

debating hall (<i>Kut<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>halas<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>l<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>) reveals one important fact, namely that the
Buddha's reluctance to give a categorical answer regarding the after death
state of the emancipated one in his dispensation had aroused the curiosity of
those recluses and brahmins. That is why they kept on discussing the subject at
length. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, it was not the fact that
he had refused to make any comment at all on this point. Only, that the comment
he had made appeared so strange to them, as we may well infer from <i>Vacchagotta's</i>&nbsp;report
of the discussion at the debating hall. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha's comment on the
subject, which they had quoted, was not based on the tetralemma. It was a
completely new formulation.<i> Acchecchi ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vattayi saÃ±Ã±ojana<span

&quot;he cut off craving, disjoined the fetter and, by rightly understanding
conceit for what it is, made an end of suffering&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This then, is the correct answer,
and not any one of the four corners of the tetralemma. This brief formula is of
paramount importance. When craving is cut off, the 'guide-in-becoming', which
is responsible for rebirth, is done away with. It is as if the fetter binding
to another existence has been unhooked. The term <i>bhavasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yojanakkhaya</i>,
&quot;destruction of the fetter to existence&quot;, we came across earlier,
conveys the same sense.<a name="_ednref688"></a><a href="#_edn688" title=""><span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhisamaya</i>
is also highly significant. With the dispelling of ignorance, the conceit
&quot;am&quot;, <i>asmim<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, is seen for what
it is. It disappears when exposed to the light of understanding and that is the
end of suffering as well. The concluding phrase<i> antam ak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>si
dukkhassa</i>, &quot;made an end of suffering&quot;, is conclusive enough. The
problem that was there all the time was the problem of suffering, so the end of
suffering means the end of the whole problem.</span></p>

with the tetralemma, are known as <i>aby<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>katavatth<span

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[691]</span></span></a> Various recluses and brahmins,
as well as king <i>Pasenadi Kosala</i>, posed these ten questions to the
Buddha, hoping to get categorical answers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why the Buddha laid them aside is
a problem to many scholars. Some, like <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>lu<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ky<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>putta</i>, would put
it down to agnosticism. Others would claim that the Buddha laid them aside
because they are irrelevant to the immediate problem of deliverance, though he
could have answered them. That section of opinion go by the <i>Si<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vanasutta</i> in the <i>Saccasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta </i>of the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Once while dwelling in a <i>si<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> grove, the
Buddha took up some <i>si<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>
leaves in his hands and asked the monks: &quot;What do you think, monks, which
is more, these leaves in my hand or those in the <i>si<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sap<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i><span lang=ZH-TW> </span>grove?&quot; The monks
reply that the leaves in the hand are few and those in the <i>si<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>&nbsp;grove are
greater in number. Then the Buddha makes a declaration to the following effect:
&quot;Even so, monks, what I have understood through higher knowledge and not
taught you is far more than what I have taught you&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If we rely on this simile, we
would have to grant that the questions are answerable in principle, but that
the Buddha preferred to avoid them because they are not relevant. But this is
not the reason either. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All these ten questions are based
on wrong premises. To take them seriously and answer them would be to grant the
validity of those premises. The dilemmas and the tetralemma seek arbitrarily to
corner anyone who tries to answer them. The Buddha refused to be cornered that
way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The first two alternatives,
presented in the form of a dilemma, are <i>sassato loko,</i> &quot;the world is
eternal&quot;, and <i>asassato loko,</i> &quot;the world is not eternal&quot;.
This is an attempt to determine the world in temporal terms. The next set of alternatives
seeks to determine the world in spatial terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why did the Buddha refuse to
answer these questions on time and space? It is because the concept of 'the
world' has been given quite a new definition in this dispensation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Whenever the Buddha redefined a
word in common usage, he introduced it with the phrase <i>ariyassa vinaye</i>,
&quot;in the discipline of the noble ones&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have already mentioned on an
earlier occasion that according to the discipline of the noble ones, 'the
world' is said to have arisen in the six sense-spheres, <i>chasu loko

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[693]</span></span></a>
In short, the world is redefined in terms of the six spheres of sense. This is
so fundamentally important that in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>yatanasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i> of the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta
Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>&nbsp;the theme comes up again and
again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For instance, in the <i>Samiddhisutta</i>
Venerable <i>Samiddhi</i> poses the following question to the Buddha: '<i>Loko,
loko'ti, bhante, vuccati. Kitt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vat<span

style='font-size:8.0pt'>[694]</span></span></a> &quot;'The world, the world',
so it is said Venerable sir, but how far, Venerable sir, does this world or the
concept of the world go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha gives the following
answer: <i>Yattha kho, Samiddhi, atthi cakkhu, atthi r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>p<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, atthi cakkhuviÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a<span

lokapaÃ±Ã±atti v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;where there is the eye,
<i>Samiddhi</i>, where there are forms, where there is eye-consciousness, where
there are things cognizable by eye-consciousness, there exists the world or the
concept of the world&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A similar statement is made with
regard to the other spheres of sense, including the mind. That, according to
the Buddha, is where the world exists. Then he makes a declaration concerning
the converse:<i> Yattha ca kho, Samiddhi, natthi cakkhu, natthi r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, natthi cakkhuviÃ±Ã±<span

&quot;where there is no eye, <i>Samiddhi</i>, where there are no forms, where
there is no eye-consciousness, where there are no things cognizable by
eye-consciousness, there the world does not exist, nor any concept of the
world&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>From this we can well infer that
any attempt to determine whether there is an end of the world, either in
temporal terms or in spatial terms, is misguided. It is the outcome of a wrong
view, for there is a world so long as there are the six spheres of sense. That
is why the Buddha consistently refused to answer those questions regarding the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There are a number of definitions
of the world given by the Buddha. We shall cite two of them. A certain monk
directly asked the Buddha to give a definition of the world: <i>Loko, loko'ti
bhante, vuccati. Kitt<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
nu kho, bhante, loko'ti vuccati</i>? &quot;'The world, the world', so it is
said. In what respect, Venerable sir, is it called a world?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

dependent on eye-contact, be it pleasant, or painful, or

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here the Buddha is redefining the
concept of the world, punning on the verb <i>lujjati</i>, which means to
&quot;break up&quot; or &quot;disintegrate&quot;. To bring about a radical
change in outlook, in accordance with the <i>Dhamma</i>, the Buddha would
sometimes introduce a new etymology in preference to the old. This definition
of 'the world' is to the same effect. </span></p>

conceived substantially as a unit. How then can an eternity or infinity be
predicated about it? If all the so-called things in the world, listed above,
are all the time disintegrating, any unitary concept of the world is
fallacious. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Had the Buddha answered those
misconceived questions, he would thereby concede to the wrong concept of the
world current among other religious groups. So then we can understand why the
Buddha refused to answer the first four questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us examine the next
dilemma, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>va<span

soul is one thing and the body another&quot;. To these questions also, the
other religionists insisted on a categorical answer, either 'yes' or 'no'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a 'catch' in the way
these questions are framed. The Buddha refused to get caught by them. These two
questions are of the type that clever lawyers put to a respondent these days. They
would sometimes insist strictly on a 'yes' or 'no' as answer and ask a question
like 'have you now given up drinking?'. If the respondent happens to be a
teetotaller, he would be in a quandary, since both answers tend to create a
wrong impression. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

alternatives, &quot;the soul and the body are the same, the soul is one thing
and the body another&quot;. Either way there is a presumption of a soul, which
the Buddha did not subscribe to. The Buddha had unequivocally declared that the
idea of soul is the outcome of an utterly foolish view, <i>kevalo parip<span

meant for those of other sects. The latter adhered to the view that both the
ordinary disciple as well as the perfected individual in their systems of
thought had a soul of some description or other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The other day we discussed, to
some extent, the ten questions known as the &quot;ten indeterminate
points&quot;, <i>dasa avy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>katavatth<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ni</i>, which the Buddha laid aside, refusing to give a
categorical answer as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. We pointed out, that
the reason why he refused to answer them was the fact that they were founded on
some wrong views, some wrong assumptions. To give categorical answers to such
questions would amount to an assertion of those views. So he refrained from
giving clear-cut answers to any of those questions. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Already from our last sermon, it
should be clear, to some extent, how the eternalist and annihilationist views
peep through them. The tetralemma on the after-death state of the <i>Tath<span

presupposes the validity of those two extreme views. Had the Buddha given a
categorical answer, he too would be committing himself to the presumptions
underlying them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The middle path he promulgated to
the world is one that transcended both those extremes. It is not a piecemeal
compromise between them. He could have presented a half-way solution by taking
up one or the other of the last two standpoints, namely &quot;the <i>Tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> both exists and does not exist after
death&quot;, or &quot;the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;neither
exists nor does not exist after death&quot;. But instead of stooping to that
position, he rejected the questionnaire in toto. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On the other hand, he brought in a
completely new mode of analysis, illustrative of the law of dependent arising

connection is particularly significant. This word came up in our discussion of

There we had much to say about the word. It is synonymous with <i>samaÃ±Ã±<span

&quot;designation&quot;. Reckoning, appellation and designation are synonymous
to a great extent. So the concluding statement of the Buddha, already quoted,
makes it clear that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;cannot
be reckoned or designated in terms of form, though he has form, he cannot be
reckoned by feeling, though he experiences feeling, nor can he be reckoned by,

consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in order to make a reckoning,
or a designation, there has to be a duality, a dichotomy. We had occasion to
touch upon this normative tendency to dichotomize. By way of illustration we
may refer to the fact that even the price of an article can be reckoned, so
long as there is a vortex between supply and demand. There has to be some kind
of vortex between two things, for there to be a designation. A vortex, or <i>va<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a</i>, is an alternation between two things, a
cyclic interrelation. A designation can come in only so long as there is such a
cyclic process. Now the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is free
from this duality.</span></p>

letting go of name-and-form, and realizing the state of a non-manifestative
consciousness, the <i>arahant </i>has, in this very life, realized the
cessation of existence, which amounts to a cessation of suffering as well.

the <i>arahant</i>. The commentary to the <i>Sutta Nip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta</i>,<i>
Paramatthajotik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, gives the following
definition to the term when it comes up in the <i>Kasibh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>radv<span

the word <i>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a</i>, associated with it,
we may say that the term has a deeper meaning. From the point of view of
etymology, the word <i>keval<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> is suggestive of
singularity, full integration, aloofness and solitude. We spoke of a letting go
of name-and-form. The non-manifestative consciousness, released from

asking where the extinguished fire has gone. One might say that the vortex has
'joined' the ocean. But that, too, would not be a proper statement to make.
From the very outset what in fact was there was the great ocean, so one cannot
say that the vortex has gone somewhere, nor can one say that it is not gone. It
is also incorrect to say that it has joined the ocean. A cessation of a vortex
gives rise to such a problematic situation. So is this state called <i>keval<span

have paid sufficient attention to the implications of this simile. But when one

whirling vortex can we point out a 'here' and a 'there'. In the vast ocean,

going on in the form of the vortex, there is a possibility of designation or
appellation as 'so-and-so'. But once the vortex has ceased, there is actually
nothing to identify with, for purposes of designation. The most one can say
about it, is to refer to it as the place where a vortex has ceased. </span></p>

food and drink, to make a few rounds within, only to be exuded as dirty excreta

the dichotomy from which the <i>arahant</i> is free. The context unmistakeably
proves that the expression <i>na upalabbhati</i> means &quot;not to be
found&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All this goes to show that the
Buddha set aside the four questions forming the tetralemma not because they are
irrelevant from the point of view of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
despite the fact that he could have answered them. That is to say, not that he
could not, but that he would not. How can one say that the question of an <i>arahant's
</i>after death state is totally irrelevant? So that is not the reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The reason is that the questions
are misleading. Those who posed these questions had the presumption that the
word <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;implied a truly
existing being or a person. But the Buddha pointed out that the concept of a
being or a person is fallacious. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though it is fallacious, for the
worldling living in an illusory unreal world, it has its place as a relative
reality. Due to the very fact that it is grasped, it is binding on him.
Therefore, when a worldling uses such terms as 'I' and 'mine', or a 'being' and
a 'person', it is not a mere way of expression. It is a level of reality proper
to the worldling's scale of values. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But for the <i>arahants</i>, who
have reached the state of suchness, it is a mere concept. In fact, it becomes a
mere concept in the context of the simile of the vortex and the ocean. That is
to say, in the case of the <i>arahants</i>, their five aggregates resemble the
flotsam and jetsam on the surface waters of a vortex already ceased at its
depth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>On seeing the Buddha and the <i>arahants</i>,
one might still say, as a way of saying, 'here is the Buddha', 'here are the <i>arahants</i>'.
For the Buddha, the concept of a 'being' is something incompatible with his
teaching from beginning to end. But for the nonce he had to use it, as is
evident from many a discourse. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With the permission of the Most
Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of the venerable meditative monks.
This is the twentysecond sermon in the series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We made an attempt, in our last
sermon, to explain that the comparison of the emancipated one in this
dispensation to the great ocean has a particularly deep significance. We
reverted to the simile of the vortex by way of explanation. Release from the <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i> vortex, or the
breach of the vortex of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
is comparable to the cessation of a whirlpool. It is equivalent to the stoppage
of the whirlpool of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Generally, what is known as a
vortex or a whirlpool, is a certain pervert, unusual or abnormal activity,
which sustains a pretence of an individual existence in the great ocean with a
drilling and churning as its centre. It is an aberration, functioning according
to a duality, maintaining a notion of two things. As long as it exists, there
is the dichotomy between a 'here' and a 'there', oneself and another. A vortex
reflects a conflict between an 'internal' and an 'external' - a 'tangle within'
and a 'tangle without'. The cessation of the vortex is the freedom from that
duality. It is a solitude born of full integration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We happened to discuss the meaning
of the term <i>keval<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> in our last sermon. The
cessation of a vortex is at once the resolution of the conflict between an internal
and an external, of the tangle within and without. When a vortex ceases, all
those conflicts subside and a state of peace prevails. What remains is the
boundless great ocean, with no delimitations of a 'here' and a 'there'. As is
the great ocean, so is the vortex now. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This suchness itself indicates the
stoppage, the cessation or the subsidence of the vortex. There is no longer any
possibility of pointing out a 'here' and a 'there' in the case of a vortex that
has ceased. Its 'thusness' or 'suchness' amounts to an acceptance of the
reality of the great ocean. That 'thus-gone' vortex, or the vortex that has now
become 'such', is in every respect worthy of being called <i>tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The term <i>t<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i> is also semantically related to this suchness. The
<i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is sometimes referred to as <i>t<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>&nbsp;or <i>t<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>diso</i>, &quot;such-like&quot;. The 'such-like'
quality of the <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is associated with
his unshakeable deliverance of the mind. His mind remains unshaken before the
eight worldly vicissitudes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why the Buddha refused to give an
answer to the tetralemma concerning the after-death state of the <i>tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, should be clear to a great extent by those <i>sutta</i>
quotations we brought up in our last sermon. Since the quotation <i>di<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>heva dhamme saccato thetato tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gate anupalabbhiyam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ne,</i><a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[730]</span></span></a><i>
</i>&quot;when a <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is not to be
found in truth and fact here in this very life&quot;, leads to the inference
that a <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is not to be found in
reality even while he is alive, we were forced to conclude that the question
'what happens to the <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata </i>after his
death?' is utterly meaningless. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is also obvious from the
conclusive statement, <i>pubbe c<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> etarahi ca dukkhaÃ±ceva paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>pemi
dukkhassa ca nirodha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i> - &quot;formerly as
well as now I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering&quot; -
that the Buddha, in answering this question, completely put aside such
conventional terms like 'being' and 'person', and solved the problem on the
basis of the four noble truths, which highlight the pure quintessence of the <i>Dhamma</i>
as it is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We have to go a little deeper into
this question of conventional terms like 'being' and 'person', because the
statement that the <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> does not exist
in truth and fact is likely to drive fear into the minds of the generality of
people. In our last sermon, we gave a clue to an understanding of the sense in
which this statement is made, when we quoted an extraordinary new etymology,
the Buddha had advanced, for the term <i>satta</i> in the <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhasa<span

</i>&quot;<i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dha</i>, that desire, that lust,
that delight, that craving in form with which one is attached and thoroughly attached,
therefore is one called a 'being'.&quot;<span class=MsoEndnoteReference> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here the Buddha has punned on the
word <i>satta</i>, to give a new orientation to its meaning, that is, <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pe satto visatto</i>, &quot;attached and thoroughly
attached to form&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>From prehistoric times, the word <i>satta</i>
was associated with the idea of some primordial essence called <i>sat</i>,
which carried with it notions of permanent existence in the world. As
derivatives from the present participle <i>sant</i> and <i>sat</i>, we get the
two words <i>satya</i> and <i>sattva </i>in Sanskrit. <i>Satya</i>&nbsp;means
&quot;truth&quot;, or what is &quot;true&quot;. <i>Sattva </i>means a
&quot;being&quot; or the &quot;state of being&quot;. We might even take <i>sattva</i>
as the place from which there is a positive response or an affirmation of a
state of being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Due to the semantic affinity
between <i>satya</i>, &quot;truth&quot;, and <i>sattva</i>, &quot;being&quot;,
an absolute reality had been granted to the term <i>sattva</i> from ancient
times. But according to the new etymology advanced by the Buddha, the term <i>sattva</i>
is given only a relative reality within limits, that is to say, it is 'real'
only in a limited and a relative sense. The above quotation from the <i>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhasa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta </i>makes it
clear that a being exists only so long as there is that desire, lust, delight
and craving in the five aggregates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Alternatively, when there is no
desire, or lust, or delight, or craving for any of the five aggregates, there
is no 'being'. That is why we say that it is real only in a limited and
relative sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When a thing is dependent on
another thing, it is relative and for that very reason it has a limited
applicability and is not absolute. Here, in this case, the dependence is on
desire or attachment. As long as there is desire or attachment, there is a
'being', and when it is not there, there is no 'being'. So from this we can
well infer that the <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;is not a
'being' by virtue of the very definition he had given to the term <i>satta</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The other day, we briefly quoted a
certain simile from the <i>R<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhasutta</i> itself,
but could not explain it sufficiently. The Buddha gives this simile just after
advancing the above new definition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Suppose, <i>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dha</i>, some little boys and girls are playing with
sandcastles. So long as their lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving
for those things have not gone away, they remain fond of them, they play with
them, treat them as their property and call them their own. But when, <i>R<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dha</i>, those little boys and girls have outgrown that
lust, desire, love, thirst, passion and craving for those sandcastles, they
scatter them with their hands and feet, demolish them, dismantle them and
render them unplayable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When we reflect upon the meaning
of this simile from the point of view of <i>Dhamma</i>, it seems that for those
little boys and girls, sandcastles were real things, as long as they had
ignorance and craving with regard to them. When they grew wiser and outgrew
craving, those sandcastles became unreal. That is why they destroyed them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The untaught worldling is in a
similar situation. So long as he is attached to these five aggregates and has
not comprehended their impermanent, suffering-fraught and not-self nature, they
are real for him. He is bound by his own grasping. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The reality of the law of <i>kamma</i>,
of merit and demerit, follows from that very grasping. The dictum <i>up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>napaccay<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> bhavo</i>, &quot;dependent on grasping is
existence&quot;, becomes meaningful in this context. There is an existence
because there is grasping. But at whatever point of time wisdom dawned and
craving faded away, all those things tend to become unreal and there is not
even a 'being', as there is no real 'state of being'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This mode of exposition receives
support from the <i>Kacc<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yanagottasutta</i> of the

knowledge of realization by oneself for which one is not dependent on another.
The noble disciple wins to such a knowledge of realization in regard to this
fact, namely, that it is only a question of suffering and its cessation. The
right view mentioned in this context is the supramundane right view, and not
that right view which takes <i>kamma</i> as one's own, <i>kammassakat<span

groundless allegations. There was also the opposite reaction of seeking refuge
in a form of eternalism, through fear of being branded as annihilationists. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the word <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, Venerable <i>Buddhaghosa

'non-existing' or 'untraceable'. When by the word <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>
a being is meant, the sense 'non existing' is fitting; and when the influx-free
one is meant, the sense 'untraceable' is fitting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to this exegesis, the
term <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> in contexts where it means a
'being' is to be understood as non-existing, <i>asamvijjam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>no</i>,
which is equivalent in sense to the expression <i>anupalabbhiyam<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ne</i>, discussed above. On the other hand, the other
sense attributed to it is <i>avindeyyo</i>, which somehow grants the existence
but suggests that it is 'untraceable'. In other words, the <i>Tath<span

out. </span></p>

and now the influx-free one, while he is alive, is untraceable by <i>Indra</i>
and others in regard to his consciousness. Gods, including <i>Indra, Brahm<span

indeed unable in their search to find out either the insight consciousness, or
the path consciousness, or the fruition consciousness, to be able to say: 'it
is dependent on this object'. How then could they find out the consciousness of
one who has attained <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> with no
possibility of conception?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Presumably, the argument is that,
since the consciousness of the <i>arahant</i> is untraceable by the gods while
he is alive, it is all the more difficult for them to find it out when he has
attained <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. That is to say, the <i>arahant</i>&nbsp;somehow
exists, even after his <i>parinibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, only
that he cannot be traced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is obvious from this
commentarial trend that the commentator finds himself on the horns of a
dilemma, because of his inability to grasp an extremely deep dimension of
linguistic usage. The Buddha's forceful and candid declaration was too much for
him. Probably, he demurred out of excessive faith, but his stance is not in
accordance with the <i>Dhamma</i>. It falls short of right view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now recapitulate the
correct position in the light of the above <i>sutta</i>&nbsp;passage. The
Buddha declares at the very outset that the emancipated monk undergoes a
significant change by virtue of the fact that he has abandoned the conceit
'am'. That <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, that emancipated monk,
who has put down the flag of conceit, laid down the burden of the five
aggregates, and won release from the fetters to existence, defies definition
and eludes categorization. Why is that? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As we pointed out earlier, the
word <i>asmi</i> constitutes the very basis of the entire grammatical
structure.<a name="_ednref736"></a><a href="#_edn736" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[736]</span></span></a>
<i>Asmi</i>, or &quot;am&quot;, is the basic peg, which stands for the first
person. The second person and the third person come later. So <i>asmi</i> is
basic to the grammatical structure. When this basic peg is uprooted, the
emancipated monk reaches that state of freedom from the vortex. There is no
dichotomy to sustain a vortex, no two teams to keep up the vortical interplay.
Where there is no turning round, there is no room for designation, and this is
the implication of the phrase <i>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> tesa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> n'atthi paÃ±Ã±<span

is no vortex whereby to designate. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That is why the <i>Tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, in this very life, is said to have
transcended the state of a 'being'. Only as a way of speaking in terms of
worldly parlance one cannot help referring to him as a 'being'. But in truth
and fact, his position is otherwise. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Going by worldly usage, one might
indiscriminately think of applying the four propositions of the tetralemma to
the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> as well. But it is precisely
in this context that the questioner's presumptions are fully exposed. The fact
that he has misconceived the implications of the terms <i>satta</i> and <i>Tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> is best revealed by the very question whether
the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> exists after his death. It
shows that he presumes the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> to be
existing in truth and fact, and if so, he has either to go on existing or be
annihilated after death. Here, then, we have an extremely deep dimension of
linguistic usage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

defies definition due to his abandonment of proliferations of cravings, conceits
and views. Cravings, conceits and views, which bring in attachments, bindings
and entanglements to justify the usage of terms like <i>satta</i>, 'being', and
<i>puggala</i>, 'person', are extinct in the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>.

simile for you that you may grasp this meaning all the more clearly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Suppose, friend <i>Yamaka</i>,
there was a householder or a householder's son, prosperous, with much wealth
and property, protected by a bodyguard. Then some man would come by who wished
to ruin him, to harm him, to imperil him, to deprive him of life. And it would
occur to that man: 'This householder or a householder's son is prosperous, with
much wealth and property, he has his bodyguard, it is not easy to deprive him
of his life by force. What if I were to get close to him and take his life?' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then he would approach that
householder or householder's son and say to him: 'Would you take me on as a servant,
sir?' Then the householder or householder's son would take him on as a servant.
The man would serve him, rising up before him, going to bed after him, being at
his beck and call, pleasing in his conduct, endearing in his speech. The
householder or householder's son would regard him as a friend, an intimate
friend, and would place trust in him. But once the man has ascertained that the
householder or householder's son has trust in him, he waits for an opportunity
to find him alone and kills him with a sharp knife.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this is the simile. Based on
this deep simile, Venerable <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta </i>puts
the following questions to Venerable <i>Yamaka</i> to see whether he has
grasped the moral behind it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;What do you think, friend <i>Yamaka</i>,
when that man approached that householder or householder's son and said to him
'would you take me on as a servant, sir?', wasn't he a murderer even then,
though the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer'?
And when the man was serving him, rising up before him and going to bed after
him, being at his beck and call, pleasing in his conduct and endearing in his
speech, wasn't he a murderer then too, though the householder or householder's
son did not know him as 'my murderer'? And when the man, finding him alone, took
his life with a sharp knife, wasn't he a murderer then too, though the other
did not know him as 'my murderer'?&quot; Venerable <i>Yamaka </i>answers
&quot;yes, friend&quot;, by way of assent to all these matter-of-fact
questions. </span></p>

everyone of the five aggregates is a murderer, though the worldlings, ignorant
of the true state of affairs, pride themselves on each of them, saying 'this is
mine, this am I and this is my self'. As the grand finale of this instructive
discourse comes the following wonderful declaration by Venerable <i>Yamaka</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

of the Venerable <i>S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta</i>, my mind is
liberated from the influxes by non-grasping.&quot;</span></p>

and <i>ehipassika</i>, &quot;inviting to come and see&quot;. But all the same
we have to grant the fact that this discourse, which begins with a Venerable <i>Yamaka
</i>who is bigoted with such a virulent evil view, which even his fellow monks
found it difficult to dispel, concludes, as we saw, with this grand finale of a
Venerable <i>Yamaka</i>&nbsp;joyfully declaring his attainment of <i>arahant</i>-hood.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This episode bears testimony to
the fact that the tetralemma concerning the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata's

this <i>Dhamma</i>. There are some who are even scared to discuss this topic,
perhaps due to unbalanced faith - faith unwarranted by wisdom. The tetralemma,
however, reveals on analysis a wealth of valuable <i>Dhamma</i>&nbsp;material
that goes to purify one's right view. That is why the Venerable <i>Yamaka</i>
ended up as an <i>arahant</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So this discourse, also, is
further proof of the fact that the Buddha's solution to the problem of the
indeterminate points actually took the form of a disquisition on voidness. Such
expositions fall into the category called <i>suÃ±Ã±atapa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isa<span

This category of discourses avoids the conventional worldly usages, such as <i>satta</i>,
&quot;being&quot;, and <i>puggala</i>, &quot;person&quot;, and highlights the teachings
on the four noble truths, which bring out the nature of things 'as they are'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

fear into the minds of worldlings, so much so that even during the Buddha's
time there were those recorded instances of misconstruing and
misinterpretation. It is in this light that we have to appreciate the Buddha's
prediction that in the future there will be monks who would not like to listen
or lend ear to those deep and profound discourses of the Buddha, pertaining to
the supramundane and dealing with the void.</span></p>

by the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>, which are deep, profound

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This brings us to an extremely
deep dimension of this <i>Dhamma</i>. By way of clarification, we may allude to
a kind of exorcism practiced by some traditional devil dancers. At the end of
an all-night session of devil dancing, the mediating priest goes round,
exorcising the spirits from the house with fistfuls of a highly inflammable
incense powder. Blazing flames arise, as he sprinkles that powder onto the
lighted torch, directing the flames at every nook and corner of the house. Some
onlookers even get scared that he is trying to set the house on fire. But
actually no harm is done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Well, the Buddha, too, as the
mediating priest of the three realms, had to conduct a similar exorcising
ritual over linguistic conventions, aiming at some words in particular. It is
true that he made use of conventional language in order to convey his teaching.
But his <i>Dhamma </i>proper was one that transcended logic, <i>atakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vacaro</i>.<a name="_ednref743"></a><a href="#_edn743"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[743]</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It happened to be a <i>Dhamma</i>
that soared well above the limitations of grammar and logic, and analytically
exposed their very structure. The marvel of the <i>Dhamma</i> is in its very
inaccessibility to logic. That is why it defied the four-cornered logic of the
tetralemma. It refused to be cornered and went beyond the concepts of a 'being'
or a 'self'. The <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric</i>&nbsp;vortex
was breached and concepts themselves were transcended. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now this is the exorcism the
Buddha had to carry out. He smoked out the term <i>att<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
&quot;self&quot;, so dear to the whole world. Of course, he could not help
making use of that word as such. In fact there is an entire chapter in the <i>Dhammapada</i>&nbsp;entitled
<i>Attavagga</i>.<a name="_ednref744"></a><a href="#_edn744" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[744]</span></span></a>

permanent self. It stands for 'oneself'. Some who mistakenly rendered it as
'self', ended up in difficulties. Take for instance the following verse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At times, the Buddha had to be
incisive in regard to some words, which the worldlings are prone to
misunderstand and misinterpret. We have already discussed at length the
significance of such terms as <i>satta</i> and <i>tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>,
with reference to their etymological background. <i>Sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yadi<span

a self-bias. The Buddha, as we saw, performed the same ritual of exorcism to
smoke out those insinuations. His definition of the 'world' with reference to
the six sense-bases is a corrective to that erroneous concept.<a

this disintegrating nature and by overemphasizing the arising aspect that the

the six bases of sense-contact. This includes mind and mind-objects as well. In

all-night's ceremony of devil dancing. Generally this fire ordeal is horrifying
to the onlookers. The Buddha also had to stage a similar fire ordeal in the <i>Dhammay<span

administered to exorcize the malignant personality view, <i>sakk<span

imply two functions of the ritual associated with incense. While some fragrant

to the recognition of a vortex that has already ceased with the help of the

ceased, flotsam and jetsam could still go on rotating, giving the wrong
impression that the vortex is still there. If one understands that the vortex
has actually ceased deep down at its centre, and that what remains there, now,
is the great ocean, undifferentiated and unique, one can get rid of the
unfounded fear arising from the statement that there is no <i>Tath<span

from these statements is already implicit in the term <i>arahant</i>. We use
this term with reference to the Buddha as well as the <i>arahants</i>. Though

however, is that based on the mind. It is in this mode of measuring and

viewpoints, the law of dependent arising promulgated by the Buddha transcends
them by penetrating into the concept as such. The Buddha explained the arising

synonymous with the arising of the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

explanation of the way a concept of the world comes about. This is an extremely
subtle point. Since the concept of the world is a product of wrong reflection,
it is <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>, or &quot;prepared&quot;. It
is like something imagined. The <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>,

the world is finite or infinite relates to space. Both time and space involve a
circularity. The furthest limit of the forenoon is the nearest limit of the
afternoon, and the furthest limit of the afternoon is the nearest limit of the
forenoon. This is how the cycle of the day turns round. Where the forenoon ends
is the afternoon, where the afternoon ends is the forenoon. </span></p>

Speculative views and standpoints about the universe, current among the

leads to a circularity of argument as is evident from the <i>Lok<span

from <i>lok<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yata</i>, which signifies a branch of
knowledge dealing with the length and breadth of the world, perhaps a prototype
of modern science, though it relied more on logic than on experiment. The two
Brahmins were probably students of such a branch of learning. One day they came
to the Buddha and posed this question:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

knowledge and vision of everything while walking or standing, whether asleep or
awake. With these claims to omniscience, he makes the following
declaration:&quot;</span></p>

teacher <i>Niga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7789;</span>ha N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>thaputta</i>
who also has similar claims to omniscience, but declares: <i>Aha<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then the two Brahmins ask the
Buddha which of these two teachers claiming omniscience in such contradictory
terms is correct. But the Buddha's reply was: <i>Ala<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

&quot;enough, brahmins, let that question be ... I shall preach to you the <i>Dhamma</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The expression used here is
suggestive of the fact that the question belongs to the category of unexplained
points. Terms like <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>hapita</i>, &quot;left
aside&quot;, and <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>hapan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ya</i>,
&quot;should be left aside&quot;, are used with reference to indeterminate
points. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Why did the Buddha leave the
question aside? We can guess the reason, though it is not stated as such. Now
the standpoint of <i>P<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ra<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a
Kassapa </i>is: &quot;I dwell knowing and seeing an infinite world with an
infinite knowledge.&quot; One can question the validity of his claim with the
objection: You see an infinite world, because your knowledge is not finite,
that is to say, incomplete. If it is complete, there must be an end. Therefore,
going by the sense of incompleteness in the word <i>ananta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
one can refute the former view. Why you see the world as infinite is because
your knowledge lacks finality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Niga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7789;</span>ha
N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>thaputta</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>, on the other hand, is asserting that
he sees a finite world with a finite knowledge. But the followers of <i>P<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ra<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a Kassapa</i>&nbsp;can
raise the objection: you are seeing the world as finite because your knowledge
is limited. Your knowledge has an end, that is why you see a finite world. So
here, too, we have a circle, or rather a circularity of argument. The two terms
<i>anta</i> and <i>ananata</i> are ambiguous. That must be the reason why the
Buddha rejected the two standpoints in question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then he declares: &quot;I shall
preach to you the <i>Dhamma</i>&quot;, and brings up as a simile an
illustration which could be summed up as follows. Four persons endowed with the
highest ability to walk, the highest speed and the widest stride possible,
stand in the four directions. Their speed is that of an arrow and their stride
is as wide as the distance between the eastern ocean and the western ocean.
Each of them tells himself: 'I will reach the end of the world by walking' and
goes on walking for hundred years, that being his full life-span, resting just
for eating, drinking, defecating, urinating and giving way to sleep or fatigue,
only to die on the way without reaching the end of the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>'But why so?', asks the Buddha
rhetorically and gives the following explanation. &quot;I do not say, O!
Brahmins, that the end of the world can be known, seen or reached by this sort
of running. Nor do I say that there is an ending of suffering without reaching
the end of the world.&quot; Then he declares: &quot;Brahmins, it is these five
strands of sense pleasures that in the Noble One's discipline are called 'the
world'&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this particular context, the
Buddha calls these five kinds of sense-pleasures 'the world' according to the
Noble One's terminology. This does not contradict the earlier definition of the
world in terms of the six sense-bases, for it is by means of these six
sense-bases that one enjoys the five strands of sense-pleasures. However, as an
art of preaching, the Buddha defines the world in terms of the five strands of
sense-pleasures in this context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then he goes on to proclaim the
way of transcending this world of the five sense pleasures in terms of <i>jh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic</i>&nbsp;attainments. When one attains to the first
<i>jh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, one is already far removed from that
world of the five sense-pleasures. But about him, the Buddha makes the
following pronouncement: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

&quot;and I too, O! Brahmins, say this: 'This one, too, is included in the
world, this one, too, has not stepped out of the world'&quot;. The Buddha makes
the same pronouncement with regard to those who attain to the other <i>jh<span

step with these words:</span></p>

can there be an experience of cessation of the six sense-spheres? The cessation

contact presupposes a duality. Contact is always between two things, between
eye and forms, for instance. It is because of a contact between two things that
one entertains a perception of permanence in those two things. Dependent on
that contact, feelings and perceptions arise, creating a visual world. The
visual world of the humans differs from that of animals. Some things that are
visible to animals are not visible to humans. That is due to the constitution
of the eye-faculty. It is the same with regard to the ear-faculty. These are
the measuring rods and scales which build up a world. </span></p>

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ko<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hita</i>&nbsp;is
asking whether there is even a little defilement left after the cessation of
the six spheres of sense-contact. But the question is obviously not about the
remaining defilements, in which case even a categorical negative could have
been the correct answer. The question here is about the very usage of the
expressions 'is' and 'is not'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With
the cessation of the six spheres of sense-contact all four propositions of the
tetralemma, based on the two standpoints 'is' and 'is not', lose their
applicability. They are rejected in toto. Here the <i>papaÃ±ca</i>, or
&quot;conceptual proliferation&quot;, implied, is the very discrimination
between 'is' and 'is not'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The
entire world is built up on the two concepts 'is' and 'is not'. Being unaware
of the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata</i>, or &quot;prepared&quot;,
nature of these concepts, we are accustomed to say 'this is' as occasion demands.
This recording machine before us 'is there'. So also are the things which we
presume to exist. We ourselves do exist, do we not? One could say 'I am'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Out
of the two rapid processes going on within us every moment, namely arising and
passing away, we are most of the time dwelling on the side of arising. The two
concepts 'is' and 'is not' are structured on the six spheres of sense-contact.
Not only 'is' and 'is not', but also the entire logical structure connecting
these two postulates is founded on these six spheres. Here, then, we see the
fistfuls of inflammable incense powder the Buddha had directed towards language
and logic, setting all that ablaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What
this discourse highlights is the fact that by the very cessation of the six
spheres of sense-contact the cessation of conceptual proliferation is brought
about. With reference to speculative views, particularly to those wrong views
that were put aside as unexplained points, the Buddha uses the term <i>di<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hipari<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>ha</i>,
&quot;delirium of views&quot;.<a name="_ednref777"></a><a href="#_edn777"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[777]</span></span></a>
<i>Pari<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>ha</i> means &quot;delirious
fever&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Patients
in delirium cry out for water. The worldlings, in general, are in high
delirium. Even such teachers like <i>P<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ra<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a Kassapa </i>and <i>Niga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7789;</span>ha
N<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>taputta</i>, who were trying to solve these speculative
problems about the world by logic, were also in delirium. Their views, based on
wrong reflections, were mere hallucinations. They kept on raising such
questions, because they had no insight into the nature of <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i>, or
&quot;preparations&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The
worldlings spend their whole lifetime running in search of the world's end. All
that is <i>papaÃ±ca</i>, conceptual proliferation. In fact, the term <i>papaÃ±ca</i>
is so pervasive in its gamut of meaning that it encompasses the entire world.
Usually, the term is glossed over by explaining it with reference to <i>ta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>and <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, bringing in craving,
conceits and views as illustrations of <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. But that does not amount
to an explanation proper. It is only a definition in extension by giving three
instances of <i>papaÃ±ca</i>. To rattle off the three instances is not a fit
answer to the question 'what is <i>papaÃ±ca</i>'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The
primary significance of <i>papaÃ±ca</i> is traceable to the linguistic medium.
We have already shown how the network of grammar spreads as soon as the peg
'am' is driven down to earth, as it were.<a name="_ednref778"></a><a
href="#_edn778" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[778]</span></span></a> The reality in the first person
in grammar beckons a second and a third person to complete the picture. In
logic, too, a similar legerdemain takes place. The interminable questions of identity
and difference lead the logician up the garden path. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The
'world' is precariously perched on a fictitious network of grammar and logic</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It
is as a solution to all this that the Buddha came out with the extraordinary
prospect of a cessation of the six spheres of sense-contact. This, then, is a
level of experience realizable here and now. That is why the Buddha declared
that the world is in this very fathom-long body with its perceptions and mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now
as to the questions about the world, we have already pointed out that there is
a circularity involved. Though one cannot find an end in something of a cyclic
nature, there is still a solution possible. There is only one solution, that
is, to break the cycle. That is what the term <i>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>upaccheda
</i>means. One can breach the cycle. The cycle cannot be discovered by
travelling. It is not out there, but in this very stream of consciousness
within us. We have already described it as the vortex between consciousness and
name-and-form. An allusion to the breach of the vortex is found in the
following verse, which we had already discussed in connection with <i>Nibb<span

Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of the venerable meditative monks.
This is the twentyfourth sermon in the series of sermons on <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. In our last sermon, we brought up a quotation
from the <i>Rohitassa Sutta</i>, which enshrines a momentous declaration by the
Buddha to the effect that the world, the arising of the world, the cessation of
the world, and the path leading to the cessation of the world, could be pointed
out with reference to this same body with its perceptions and mind.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a name="_ednref782"></a><a href="#_edn782" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The six sense-spheres, or the six
bases of sense-contact, with which we acquaint ourselves with the world as it is
conventionally understood and measured out, are themselves called 'the world'
according to the Noble One's terminology.<span class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a
name="_ednref783"></a><a href="#_edn783" title=""><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[783]</span></a></span>
Therefore, one can declare in accordance with the <i>Dhamma</i>, that the very
cessation of those six sense-spheres is the cessation of the world. It is this
state of the cessation of the world that is known as <i>asa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>khata
dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tu</i>, or the &quot;unprepared element&quot;.
That unprepared state, described in discourses on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
in such terms as <i>atthi, bhikkhave, aj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ta<span

&quot;monks, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unprepared&quot;,
is this cessation of the six spheres of sense, which is the end of that
prepared world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So, then, this particular world's
end, the end of the world as defined here, is not a destination to be reached
by travelling. The sage <i>Rohitassa</i> walked for hundred years in search of
this world's end at a speed of a flying arrow, but he failed to discover the
world's end. Why? It is because he took 'the world' along with him in his
journey to see its end. Since this six-based body with its perceptions and mind
is itself the world, he was taking the world with him in his exploration. That
is why he had to die on the way without seeing the end of the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That end of the world, which one
cannot see or reach by travelling, the Buddha pointed out in the very cessation
of the six sense-spheres. This fact comes to light in the discourses dealing

towards the end the following statement:</span></p>

unestablished, non continuing and objectless, is itself the end of

regard to the objects of the six senses is the result of the perception of
permanence. Due to the perception of permanence, there is a grasping of signs,
and due to that grasping of signs, influxes flow in. Proliferations through
craving, conceits and views get heaped up. This is how our world is
constructed. This is the way the aggregates of attachment get accumulated. On
the other hand, the contemplation of impermanence that leads to the signless
concentration is helpful in freeing the mind from these signs. </span></p>

of two types. Where there is a perception of permanence, the tendency is to
grasp the object tenaciously and hang on to it. This pervert tendency is known
as <i>par<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masana</i>. It is impelled by the triple
proliferations of craving, conceits and views. Under its influence one is
carried away by prolific perceptions, <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
and is kept under the sway of worldly concepts and designations born of
prolific perceptions, <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span

known as <i>sammasana</i>. It is that healthy attitude which progressively
leads to the liberation of the mind from the influence of signs, and attenuates
the prolific tendencies to craving, conceits and views. This kind of reflection
is the harbinger of insight. Contemplation of impermanence on these lines
effectively puts an end to this entire mass of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span

that picture called a movie is something thought out by the mind. But the
thought itself, monks, is even more picturesque than that picture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To say that it is more picturesque
is to suggest its variegated character. Thought is intrinsically variegated. We
have no idea what sort of a motion picture was there at that time, but the
modern day movie has a way of concealing impermanence by the rapidity of
projections of the series of pictures on the screen. The rapidity itself gives
an impression of permanence, which is a perversion, <i>vipall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The movie is enjoyable because of
this perversion. Due to the perception of permanence, there is a grasping of
signs, and in the wake of it influxes flow in, giving rise to proliferation,
due to which one is overwhelmed by reckonings born of prolific
conceptualization, <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. That is how one
enjoys a film show. All this comes about as a result of ignorance, or lack of
awareness of the cinematographic tricks concealing the fleeting, vibrating and
evanescent nature of the scenes on the screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though we resort to such
artificial illustrations, by way of a simile, the Buddha declares that actually
it is impossible to give a fitting simile to illustrate the rapidity of a
thought process. Once he proclaimed: <i>Upam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span>pi
na sukar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> y<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>va

&quot;it is not easy even to give a simile to show how rapidly thought
changes&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sometimes the Buddha resorts to
double entendre to bring out piquantly some deep idea. He puns on the word <i>citta</i>,
&quot;thought&quot; or &quot;picture&quot;, in order to suggest the
'picturesque' or variegated nature of thought, when he asserts that thought is
more picturesque, <i>cittatara</i>, than the picture. We can see that it is
quite reasonable in the light of the <i>Dvayamsutta</i>. It is this series of
picturesque formations that gives us a perception of permanence, which in turn
is instrumental in creating a world before our eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Our eye changes every split
second. It is quivering, vibrating and transient. So also are the forms. But
there is a malignantly pervert idea, ingrained in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>beings, known as the perception of permanence
in the impermanent, <i>anicce niccasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
which prevents them from seeing the inherent transience of eye and forms. That
is how the six spheres of sense create a world before us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the substructure of this
sense created world that the Buddha has revealed to us in this particular
discourse on impermanence. The substructure, on analysis, reveals a duality, <i>dvaya<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Consciousness is not something
substantial and absolute, like the so-called soul. That is precisely the point
of divergence for Buddhism, when compared with those religious systems which
rely on soul theories. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>Dhamma </i>there is
mention of six consciousnesses, as <i>cakkhuviÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a,

eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body- and mind-consciousness. Everyone of these
consciousnesses is based on a dyad. Just as in the case of eye-consciousness we
are given the formula beginning with<i> cakkhuÃ±ca pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca
r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pe ca</i>, &quot;dependent on eye and
forms&quot;, so with regard to ear-consciousness we get <i>sotaÃ±ca pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca sadde ca</i>, &quot;dependent on ear and
sounds&quot;, and so on. Even when we come to mind-consciousness, the theme is
the same, <i>manaÃ±ca pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca dhamme ca</i>,
&quot;dependent on mind and mind-objects&quot;. Mind also is vibrating,
changing and transforming with extreme rapidity every moment. So are the
objects of the mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The entire world is structured on
these vibrant, transient and evanescent basic elements. That is the burden of
this powerful discourse of the Buddha. Therefore, if someone developed the
contemplation of impermanence to the highest degree and brought his mind to the
signless state, having started from the sign itself, it goes without saying
that he has realized the cessation of the world. That is, the experience of <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is, at the same time, the
cessation of proliferation, <i>papaÃ±canirodha.</i>&nbsp;Prolific conceptualization
is founded on the perception of permanence, whereby one comes under the sway of
reckonings born of prolific perceptions,<i> papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. Proliferation
creates things, giving rise to the antinomian conflict. Duality masquerades
behind it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is by mistaking the impermanent
eye and the impermanent forms as permanent that the whole confusion has come
about. One imagines the eye and forms as permanent and thereby becomes blind to
their momentary change and transience. The glue of craving and intoxicating
influxes create a facade of a real world before him. That is the world we touch
with our hands and see with our eyes. All this exposes the insubstantial nature
of this world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

heard, sensed and cognized. The <i>Dvayamsutta</i> brings to light the fact
that all these four are insubstantial and coreless. Due to this very fact, the <i>Tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata </i>who realized the cessation of the six sense-bases,
was confronted with the stupendous problem of mediating with the world that
could not even imagine the frightful prospect of a cessation of the six
sense-bases. That is to say, when he reached the state of non-proliferation, <i>nippapaÃ±ca</i>,
by experiencing the cessation of the world through the cessation of the six
sense-bases, the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata </i>had to grapple

It was at this juncture that the Buddha came and addressed this deep discourse
to those monks. According to the commentary, the discourse was so profound that
at five points of the sermon the earth shook miraculously and at the end of the

We rendered it by &quot;such&quot;. It stands for the quality of steadfastness
of the <i>arahant </i>in remaining unshaken by the eight worldly vicissitudes.
His mainstay, in this respect, is <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
or non-identification. He is such because he does not grasp any of those things
as 'mine'. So he is 'such' in regard to whatever is seen, heard, sensed and
cognized. There is no one who is higher or more excellent than this
such-like-one in point of suchness. Then comes a couplet of verses, presenting
the gist of the sermon.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Our rendering of the sermon is in
need of further explication. Though it gives a general idea, some words and
phrases in the original have far reaching implications. The basic idea behind the
series of declarations made is the extraordinary change of attitude towards the
question of speculative views, which marks off the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata
</i>from all his contemporaries. He took a completely different turn,
transcending the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism. This difference of
attitude is revealed by the riddle like statements in the first part of the
discourse. One gets the impression that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata
</i>was confronted with a problematic situation of the highest order. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The first statement is to the
effect that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata </i>knows whatever in
the world with its gods, <i>M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras</i> and Brahmas,
among the progeny consisting of recluses and Brahmins, gods and men, is seen,
heard, sensed, cognized, thought after and pondered over by the mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The second statement asserts that
the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i> has a higher understanding of
all that. All the same, he takes no stance in regard to whatever is seen,
heard, sensed and cognized. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This might appear as a riddle.
Usually when one has a higher understanding of something, one is inclined to
take one's stand upon it. But here we have a denial. The discourse bears some
resemblance to the tetralemma we had discussed earlier.<a name="_ednref804"></a><a
href="#_edn804" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[804]</span></span></a> But there seems to be a
difference here, in the formulation of the first proposition of the tetralemma.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Normally the first proposition
amounts to an unqualified assertion of the affirmative standpoint. In this
case, however, we find the statement that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata
</i>not only knows all what the world knows, but that he has a higher
understanding of it, <i>abhaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>si<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.
It is precisely because he has a higher understanding that he takes no stance
in regard to it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

let us remind ourselves of the two levels of understanding mentioned in the <i>M<span

entertain imaginings by taking earth at its face value. He is not carried away

It is precisely because of this full understanding that he has not taken his
stand upon it. He has no stance in regard to all that. This is the gist of the
first paragraph of the discourse, which sounds more or less a paradox. It is
because of this apparently queer state of affairs that the <i>Tath<span

his part to say: &quot;All that I do not know&quot;. </span></p>

a thing entitles one to assert it dogmatically. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The commentary has it that the

as a mark of approbation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

indicating the plane of the influx-free one, <i>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;&#7751;&#257;</span>savabh<span

from influxes. He does not grasp them by way of craving, conceit and views. He

by the term <i>saÃ±j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The declarations found in this discourse
bear some affinity to the above-mentioned tetralemma. However, we find here the
Buddha making the first declaration in several stages. Firstly, he makes the
statement that whatever is seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, thought after and
pondered over by all beings in the world, that he knows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the second statement he affirms
that he has a higher knowledge of all that. Then comes a sentence which
reaffirms that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata </i>has
understood, but ends with the statement &quot;the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;does
not take his stand upon it&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Generally, when confronted with
the tetralemma, the Buddha summarily dismisses all the four alternative
propositions. But here the peculiarity is in not dismissing the first
proposition at once. He declares that he knows, that he has a higher knowledge,
and that he has understood all that. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Apparently he is affirming the
first proposition, granting the validity of sensory data. But then comes the
concluding statement to the effect that he does not take his stand upon them, <i>na
upa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>si</i>,
which amounts to a negation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The secret behind this peculiar
presentation will emerge when we bring up the proper similes and parables. Till
then, what can be gleaned from the context is that the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata
</i>has no stance, not because he is ignorant, but due to the very fact that he
knows full well and has understood the nature of the sum total of sensory data.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The worldlings are prone to think
that it is when convincing knowledge is lacking that one has no such stance.
But the Buddha declares here that he takes no stance in regard to what is seen,
heard, sensed etc., precisely because he has a special understanding, a
penetrative knowledge of the essence-lessness of the data obtained through the
six sense-bases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So it seems, in this context too,
we have the negation of the first alternative, as is usual in the case of a
tetralemma, only that the negation is expressed here in a very peculiar way.
Let us now take up the second declaration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a difference of opinion
as to the correct reading of this second declaration. Deep <i>Suttas</i>&nbsp;often
present difficulties in determining the exact reading, and this is especially
the case with the <i>K<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7735;</span>ak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masutta</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In this instance, the commentary
has followed the reading <i>tam aha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> 'j<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>'ti

know', it would be a falsehood in me&quot;. But as we have pointed out earlier,
this reading is not meaningful.<a name="_ednref812"></a><a href="#_edn812"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[812]</span></span></a>
That is probably why the <i>Cha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>g<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ti-pi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>aka

&quot;if I were to say 'that I do not know'. This departure from the
commentarial tradition seems justifiable, since the Buddha has already declared
that he knows all that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It stands to reason, therefore,
that in the second declaration he makes it clear that to say 'I do not know'
would be a contradiction, a falsehood. But why this clarification? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Generally the worldlings expect
one to unequivocally assert and take one's stand upon one's viewpoint in categorical
terms, as expressed by the dictum <i>idam eva sacca<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>,
mogham aÃ±Ã±a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;this alone is true, all
else is false&quot;.<a name="_ednref813"></a><a href="#_edn813" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[813]</span></span></a>
Failure to do so is recognized as a lack of knowledge or precision. The second
declaration is meant to forestall such an objection, since the first
declaration ends with the clause <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> tath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gato na upa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>si</i>, but &quot;the <i>Tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gata</i>&nbsp;has
not taken his stand upon it&quot;. So it amounts to a statement like 'it is not
because I do not know that I take no stance'. In the same strain, we can
explain the declarations that follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It seems, then, that the second
declaration <i>tam aha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> 'na j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>'ti vadeyya<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;if I were to say, 'all that I do not know',
it would be a falsehood in me&quot;, amounts to the second alternative of the
tetralemma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The next declaration follows the
same trend. To quote the relevant portion,<i> tam aha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
'j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi ca na ca j<span

assa t<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>disam eva,</i> &quot;if I were to say 'I
both know it and do not know it', that too would be a falsehood in me&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In regard to the aforesaid seens,
heards, sensed etc., if I were to say that I know, I do not know, or even a
combination of both those statements as 'I both know and do not know', it would
be a falsehood on my part. Why? Because the world is accustomed to put down
such a vacillation to a lack of certitude. To say 'I both know it and know it
not' looks like a confession of partial knowledge, since it can mean knowledge
and ignorance going fifty-fifty. So the Buddha says, in this instance, too,
that it would likewise be a falsehood, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> p'
assa t<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>disam eva</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now we come to the fourth
statement. The Buddha declares, &quot;if I were to say 'I neither know it, nor
am ignorant of it', it would be a fault in me&quot;,<i> tam aha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> 'neva j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>mi na na j<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>n<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>, ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> mama assa kali</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We can understand that position,
too. Generally the worldlings think that a refusal to make a categorical
statement is either due to partial knowledge, or to an attitude of wriggling
out. In fact, this attitude of wriggling out had already assumed the status of
a philosophy in itself in <i>SaÃ±jaya Bela<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hiputta</i>,
a contemporary of the Buddha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When he was interrogated, he would
respond with such a series of negations like &quot;I do not say it is, I do not
say it is thus, I do not say it is otherwise, nor do I say it is neither&quot;,
etc.<a name="_ednref814"></a><a href="#_edn814" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[814]</span></span></a>
The attempt here is to evade the issue by a sort of 'eel-wriggling'. That
school of philosophy, which resorted to such an evasive legerdemain, came to be
known as <i>amar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>-vikkhepa-v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>.
The Buddha refuses to subscribe to such tactical sophistry by rejecting the
fourth alternative 'I neither know it, nor am ignorant of it'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here, then, we have the same
tetralemma, presented in a different guise. It smacks of a riddle that the
Buddha was confronted with - the riddle of coming to terms with worldly
parlance. As we have already mentioned, the commentary analyses the main theme
of the discourse into five planes. It also records that the earth shook at five
points of the discourse, that is, at the end of the proclamation for each
plane.<a name="_ednref815"></a><a href="#_edn815" title=""><span

first plane is the plane of omniscience, <i>sabbaÃ±Ã±utabh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>mi</i>.

&quot;does not take his stand upon it&quot;. It is so called because that
phrase brings out the characteristic of not taking a stance by way of cravings,
conceits and views in the case of an influx-free one. </span></p>

would be a falsehood in me&quot;,&nbsp;and <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>

the commentary as representing the third plane of truth, <i>saccabh<span

needed, let us take the case of hearing music from a distance. One imagines a
thing called 'music' and with the idea of listening to the same music goes to
the place where the music is going on. One is not aware of the fact that at
each step in that direction one is hearing a different music. Why? Because one
is ignorant of the law of dependent arising. Just as in the former case the dog
seen is dependent on the dog looking, here too, the auditory consciousness of a
music is the outcome of a dependence between ear and sound.</span></p>

the music hall to listen better to the same music. He will realize the extent
of his delusion if he happens to put his ear to the musical instrument. When he
does so, he will hear not a music, but a set of crude vibrations. But this is
what is going on in the world. The world is steeped in the delusion of
imagining that it is the same music one is hearing, though at each step in that
direction the music changes. This is due to the fact that it is dependently
arisen. Actually, there is no person hearing, but only a state of affairs
dependent on the ear and sound, a conditioned arising dependent on contact. In
the present textual context, the terms <i>di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha

seeing in the water. Such a delusion is not there in the <i>Tath<span

seriously the concept behind that word, one imagines a thing called 'music'.
The pandemonium created by a number of musical instruments is subsumed under
the word 'music'. Then one goes all the way to listen to it. The same state of
affairs prevails in the case of the seen. It is because the <i>Tath<span

explained it to some extent. It can be rendered by &quot;such&quot; or

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But this explanation is rather
misleading, as it ignores a certain deep dimension of the meaning of the term <i>t<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, the commentator happens
to quote from the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>niddesa </i>another
explanation, which is more to the point. It is briefly stated as <i>i<span

&quot;he is such in gain as well as in loss, he is such in fame as well as in
ill-fame ...&quot; etc. That is the correct explanation. Instead of saying
&quot;as he is in gain, so is he<i>&nbsp;</i>in loss&quot;, we have here a
continuous suchness in regard to all vicissitudes. He is such in gain as well
as in loss, he is such in fame as well as in ill-fame, he is such in praise as
well as in blame, he is such in pleasure as well as in pain.</span></p>

understanding of the norm called <i>tathat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
The other implication is the abstinence from the tendency towards
identification or acquisition, meant by <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
This exemplary trait is called <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.

however, has fallen into neglect at present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the case of music, for
instance, <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> would imply an
attachment to it that amounts to an identification with it. <i>Tammayo </i>means
&quot;made of that&quot;, as in <i>suva<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>amaya</i>,
&quot;made of gold&quot;, and <i>rajatamaya</i>, &quot;made of silver&quot;. To
be free from this <i>tammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, is to be <i>t<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>, &quot;such&quot;,
that is to say, not to be of that stuff, <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.

&quot;steadfastness&quot;, and &quot;immovability&quot;. Generally, one
associates firmness, immovability or stability with holding on or leaning on.
But here we have just the contrary. Not to hold on to anything, is to be
'such'. This suchness has a flexibility of a higher order, or an adaptability.

or a magician's apprentice should hold a magic show at the four crossroads and
a keen sighted man should see it, ponder over it and reflect on it radically.

it empty, he would find it hollow, he would find it void of essence. What

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So for the Buddha, consciousness
is comparable to a magic show. This is a most extraordinary exposition, not to
be found in any other philosophical system, because the soul theory tries to
sit pretty on consciousness when all other foundations are shattered. But then,
even this citadel itself the Buddha has described in this discourse as
essenceless and hollow, as a magical illusion. Let us now try to clarify for
ourselves the full import of this simile of the magic show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A certain magician is going to
hold a magic show in some hall or theatre. Among those who have come to see the
magic show, there is a witty person with the wisdom eye, who tells himself:
'Today I must see the magic show inside out!' With this determination he hides
himself in a corner of the stage, unseen by others. When the magic show starts,
this person begins to discover, before long, the secrets of the magician, his
deceitful stock-in-trade - counterfeits, hidden strings and buttons, secret
pockets and false bottoms in his magic boxes. He observes clearly all the
secret gadgets that the audience is unaware of. With this vision, he comes to
the conclusion that there is no magic in any of those gadgets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Some sort of disenchantment sets
in. Now he has no curiosity, amazement, fright or amusement that he used to get
whenever he watched those magic shows. Instead he now settles into a mood of
equanimity. Since there is nothing more for him to see in the magic show, he
mildly turns his attention towards the audience. Then he sees the contrast. The
entire hall is a sea of craned necks, gaping mouths and goggle-eyes with 'Ahs'
and 'Ohs' and whistles of speechless amazement. At this sorry sight, he even
feels remorseful that he himself was in this same plight before. So in this way
he sees through the magic show - an 'insight' instead of a 'sight'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When the show ends, he steps out
of the hall and tries to slink away unseen. But he runs into a friend of his,
who also was one of the spectators. Now he has to listen to a vivid commentary
on the magic show. His friend wants him to join in his appreciation, but he
listens through with equanimity. Puzzled by this strange reserved attitude, the
friend asks: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Why, you were in the same
hall all this time, weren't you?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Yes, I was.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Then were you
sleeping?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Oh, no.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;You weren't watching
closely, I suppose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;No, no, I was watching it
all right, maybe I was watching too closely.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;You say you were watching,
but you don't seem to have seen the show.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;No, I saw it. In fact I saw
it so well that I missed the show.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The above dialogue between the man
who watched the show with discernment and the one who watched with naive
credulity should give a clue to the riddle-like proclamations of the Buddha in
the <i>K<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7735;</span>ak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masutta</i>. The Buddha also was confronted with the
same problematic situation after his enlightenment, which was an insight into
the magic show of consciousness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>That man with discernment hid
himself in a corner of the stage to get that insight. The Buddha also had to
hide in some corner of the world stage for his enlightenment. The term <i>pa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>isall<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
&quot;solitude&quot;, has a nuance suggestive of a hide-away. It is in such a
hide-away that the Buddha witnessed the interior of the six-fold sense-base.
The reason for his equanimity towards conflicting views about truth and
falsehood in the world, as evidenced by this discourse, is the very insight
into the six sense-bases. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

The term is usually explained as signifying the quality of remaining unshaken
before the eight worldly vicissitudes. But in this context, it has a special
significance. It implies an equanimous attitude towards dogmatic views and
view-holders. This attitude avoids categorical affirmation or negation
regarding the question of truth and falsehood. It grants a relative reality to
those viewpoints. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is the moral behind the
hesitation to give clear-cut answers to that inquisitive friend in our pithy
dialogue. It is not the outcome of a dilly-dally attitude. There is something really
deep. It is the result of an insight into the magic show. The reason for this
suchness is the understanding of the norm of dependent arising, known as <i>tathat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is obvious from the expositions
of the norm of dependent arising that there are two aspects involved, namely, <i>anuloma</i>,
direct order, and <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>iloma</i>, indirect
order. The direct order is to be found in the first half of the twelve linked
formula, beginning with the word <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>paccay<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;dependent on ignorance, preparations&quot;,
while the indirect order is given in the second half with the words, <i>avijj<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya tveva asesavir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ganirodh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>etc., &quot;with the remainderless fading away and
cessation of ignorance&quot; etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The implication is that where
there is ignorance, aggregates of grasping get accumulated, which, in other
words, is a heaping up of suffering. That is a fact. But then, when ignorance
fades away and ceases, they do not get accumulated. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, with this magic show as an
illustration, we can get down to a deeper analysis of the law of dependent arising.
In a number of earlier sermons, we have already made an attempt to explain a
certain deep dimension of this law, with the help of illustrations from the
dramatic and cinematographic fields. The magic show we have brought up now is
even more striking as an illustration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the case of the cinema, the
background of darkness we compared to the darkness of ignorance. Because of the
surrounding darkness, those who go to the cinema take as real whatever they see
on the screen and create for themselves various moods and emotions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the case of the magic show, the
very ignorance of the tricks of the magician is what accounts for the apparent
reality of the magic performance. Once the shroud of ignorance is thrown off,
the magic show loses its magic for the audience. The magician's secret
stock-in-trade gave rise to the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ras </i>or preparations with the help of which the
audience created for themselves a magic show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To that discerning man, who viewed
the show from his hiding place on the stage, there were no such preparations.
That is why he proverbially missed the show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The same principle holds good in
the case of the magical illusion, <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>y<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, that is consciousness. A clear instance of this
is the reference in the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Vedallasutta </i>of
the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya </i>to <i>viÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>, consciousness, and <i>paÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, wisdom, as two conjoined psychological states.
They cannot be separated one from the other, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> no visa<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[843]</span></span></a>
But they can be distinguished functionally. Out of them, wisdom is to be
developed, while consciousness is to be comprehended, <i>paÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vetabb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, viÃ±Ã±<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The development of wisdom is for
the purpose of comprehending consciousness and comprehended consciousness
proves to be empty, essenceless and hollow. It is such a transformation that
took place within the person who watched the magic show with discernment. He
watched it too closely, so much so, that the preparations, <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
in the form of the secret stock-in-trade of the magician, became ineffective
and nugatory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This makes clear the connection
between ignorance, <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, and
preparations, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. That is why ignorance takes precedence in the
formula of dependent arising. Preparations owe their effectiveness to
ignorance. They are dependent on ignorance. To understand preparations for what
they are is knowledge. Simultaneous with the arising of that knowledge,
preparations become mere preparations, or pure preparations, <i>suddha sa<span

true, permanent or eternal, are mere phenomena arisen from the mind. <i>Manopubbangam<span

dependent arising is the way to liberate the mind from the whole lot of
dependently arisen things. Now why do we say so? Everyone of those twelve

of a nature to wither away, wear away, fade away and cease, <i>anicca<span

All the links are therefore unreal in the highest sense. They are dependent on

about this. One must not miss the wood for the trees. When the Buddha stretches
his arm and says: 'That is a forest', he does not expect us to go and grasp any
of the trees, or to go on counting them, so as to understand what a forest is.
One has to get a synoptic view of it from here itself. Such a view takes into
account not only the trees, but also the intervening spaces between them, all at
one synoptic glance. </span></p>

one's mind to rest on the norm that obtains between every two links. But this
is something extremely difficult, because the world is steeped in the notion of
duality. It grasps either this end, or the other end. Hard it is for the world
to understand the stance of the <i>arahant</i> couched in the cryptic phrase <i>nev'
idha na hura<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> na ubhayam antare</i>,
&quot;neither here nor there nor in between the two&quot;.<a name="_ednref854"></a><a

illustration, let us suppose that the magician is performing a trick, which
earlier appeared as a miracle. But now that one sees the counterfeits, hidden
strings and secret bottoms, one is aware of the fact that the magical effect is
due to the evocative nature of those preparations. So he does not take
seriously those preparations. His ignorance is thereby reduced to the same
extent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

suggests. All the links are of a nature to wither away, wear away, fade away
and cease. So, then, preparations are there only when ignorance is there. The
preparations are effective only so long as ignorance is there. With the arising
of ignorance, preparations arise. When ignorance is not there, preparations
lose their provenance. With the complete fading away and cessation of
ignorance, preparations, too, fade away and cease without residue. This, then,
is the relationship between those two links</span></p>

take consciousness as a compact unit. They regard it as their self or soul.

consciousness ceases to appear as a monolithic whole. This particular
eye-consciousness has arisen because of eye and forms. This particular
ear-consciousness has arisen because of ear and sound, and so on. This kind of
reflection and constant awareness of the part played by preparations in the
arising of consciousness will conduce to the withering away, wearing away and
fading away of consciousness. Disgust, disillusionment and dejection in regard

traceable to the term <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These three discourses tell us
that, after the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha spent the first week in
the same seated posture under the Bodhi tree, and that on the last night of the
week he reflected on the Law of Dependent Arising in the direct order in the
first watch of the night, in the reverse order in the second watch, and both in
direct and reverse order in the last watch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These last-mentioned reflection,
both in direct and reverse order, is like a compromise between the deluded
point of view and the discerning point of view, mentioned above. Now, in a
magic show to see <b>how</b> the magic is performed, is to get disenchanted
with it, to make it fade away and cease, to free the mind from its spell. By
seeing <b>how</b> a magician performs, one gets disgusted with <b>what</b> he
performs. Similarly, seeing the arising of the six bases of sense-contact is
the way to get disenchanted with them, to make them fade away and cease, to
transcend them and be emancipated.</span></p>

any magic. That is the mental transformation that occurred in the man who
watched the magic show from a hidden corner of the stage. This gives us a clue
to the cessation of consciousness in the <i>arahant</i> and the consequent
non-manifestative consciousness attributed to him. </span></p>

As in the case of a magic show, the delusory character of the magic of
consciousness is traceable to the perception of form. It is the perception of
form which gives rise to the host of reckonings through cravings, conceits and

requirement. That verse, beginning with the words <i>na saÃ±Ã±asaÃ±Ã±<span

of the magician, he lost the earlier impulses to laugh, cry and fear. Now he
has no curiosity, since the delusion is no more. At least temporarily,
ignorance has gone down in the light of understanding. According to this norm,

one does not give any significance to signs, one does not direct one's mind to
anything. <i>Pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>idhi </i>means &quot;direction of
the mind&quot;, an &quot;aspiration&quot;. In the absence of any aspiration,
there is nothing <i>'</i>essence-tial' in existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is a certain interconnection
between the three deliverances. <i>Animitta</i>, the signless, is that stage in
which the mind refuses to take a sign or catch a theme in anything. Where lust,
hate and delusion are not there to give any significance, signs become
ineffective. That is the signless. Where there is no tendency to take in signs,
there is no aspiration, expectation or direction of the mind. It is as if
dejection in regard to the magic show has given rise to disenchantment and
dispassion. When the mind is not directed to the magic show, it ceases to
exist. It is only when the mind is continually there, directed towards the
magic show or a film show, that they exist for a spectator. One finds oneself
born into a world of magic only when one sees something substantial in it. A
magic world is made up only when there is an incentive to exist in it.</span></p>

consciousness. Where there is no grasping at signs, there is no direction or
expectation, in the absence of which, existence ceases to appear substantial.

to familiarize ourselves with the facts we have related so far. Two friends are
seen drawing something together on a board with two kinds of paints. Let us
have a closer look. They are painting a chess board. Now the board is
chequered. Some throw-away chunks of wood are also painted for the pieces. So
the board and pieces are ready. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Though they are the best of
friends and amicably painted the chessboard, the game of chess demands two
sides - the principle of duality. They give in to the demand and confront each
other in a playful mood. A hazy idea of victory and defeat, another duality,
hovers above them. But they are playing the game just for fun, to while away
the time. Though it is for fun, there is a competition. Though there is a competition,
it is fun. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>While the chess-game is in
progress, a happy-go-lucky benefactor comes by and offers a handsome prize for
the prospective winner, to enliven the game. From now onwards, it is not just
for fun or to while away the time that the two friends are playing chess. Now
that the prospect of a prize has aroused greed in them, the innocuous game
becomes a tussle for a prize. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Worthless pieces dazzle with the
prospect of a prize. But just then, there comes a pervert killjoy, who shows a
threatening weapon and adds a new rule to the game. The winner will get the
prize all right, but the loser he will kill with his deadly weapon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So what is the position now? The
sportive spirit is gone. It is now a struggle for dear life. The two friends
are now eying each other as an enemy. It is no longer a game, but a miserable
struggle to escape death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We do not know, how exactly the
game ended. But let us hold the post mortem all the same. We saw how those
worthless chunks of wood picked up to serve as pieces on the chessboard,
received special recognition once they took on the paint. They represented two
sides. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>With the prospect of a prize, they
got animated in the course of the game, due to cravings, conceits and views in
the minds of the two players. Those impulses were so overwhelming that
especially after the death knell sounded, the whole chess board became the
world for these two friends. Their entire attention was on the board - a life
and death struggle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But this is only one aspect of our
illustration. The world, in fact, is a chessboard, where an unending chess game
goes on. Let us look at the other aspect. Now, for the <i>arahant</i>, the
whole world appears like a chessboard. That is why the <i>arahant</i>
Adhimutta, when the bandits caught him while passing through a forest and got
ready to kill him, uttered the following instructive verse, which we had quoted

on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, we were trying to explain what
sort of a state <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is. We had to do
so, because there has been quite a lot of confusion and controversy regarding <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>as the aim of the spiritual endeavour in
Buddhism. The situation today is no better. Many of those who aspire to <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>today, aim not at the cessation of existence,
but at some form of quasi existence as a surrogate <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

arrow reach the target? Our attempt so far has been to clarify and highlight

have been successful in this attempt, the task before us now is to adumbrate
the salient features of the path of practice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Up to now, we have been
administering a purgative, to dispel some deep-rooted wrong notions. If it has
worked, it is time now for the elixir. In the fore-going sermons, we had
occasion to bring up a number of key terms in the <i>suttas</i>, which have
been more or less relegated into the limbo and rarely come up in serious <i>Dhamma
</i>discussions. We have highlighted such key terms as <i>suÃ±Ã±at<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, <i>dvayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, <i>tathat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, idappaccayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, papaÃ±ca, </i>and <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
We have also discussed some aspects of their significance. But in doing so, our
main concern was the dispelling of some misconceptions about <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

however, is not the satisfying of some curiosity at an academic level. It is to
pave the way for an attainment of this goal, by rediscovering the intrinsic
qualities of this <i>Dhamma</i> that is well proclaimed, <i>sv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>kkh<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Its interpretation centres around
the word <i>dha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ka</i>, which means a crow. In
order to explain how thoughts disperse, it alludes to a game among village

away so that it is forced to come back and fall at their feet.<a

lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>in trying to explain that evil thoughts, <i>vitakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, distract the mind, <i>mano</i>. If the variant
reading <i>kum<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>kam iv' ossajanti</i> is adopted, the element <i>v
</i>in <i>va<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>kam iv' ossajanti </i>could be taken
as a hiatus filler, <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gama</i>, and then we have
the meaningful phrase <i>kum<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>

it up into two words. It is queer to find the same commentator analyzing this
compound differently in another context. In explaining the term <i>manovitakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> occurring in the <i>Kummasutta </i>of the <i>Devat<span

</i>is a word which has such meanings as &quot;moisture&quot; and
&quot;affection&quot;. In the simile of the banyan tree, the trunk-born runners
are born of moisture. They are self-begotten. Thoughts in the mind cleave to
diverse external objects. Just as the runners of a banyan tree, once they take
root would even conceal the main trunk, which gave them birth, so the thoughts
in the mind, attached to external objects of sense, would conceal their true
source and origin. Non radical reflection could easily come in. The runners are
moisture-born and self-begotten from the point of view of the original banyan
tree. The main trunk gets overshadowed by its own runners. </span></p>

is a plant parasite. When some bird drops a seed of a <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>luv<span

creeper comes up. As time goes on, it overspreads the tree, which gave it

of non radical reflection. Conceptual proliferation obscures the true source,

the Buddha. It is to illustrate this self-begotten nature that the Buddha
brings in the similes of the banyan tree and the <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>luv<span

branches of a banyan tree reach the ground and get rooted, after a time, it will
be difficult to distinguish the original trunk of the tree from its offsprings.
So also is the case with the parasitic <i>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>luv<span

The delusion or ignorance is the non-understanding of the reciprocal

play the game, there should be two sides. It is after this bifurcation and
confrontation as two sides that the actual game starts, with its vicissitudes
of winning and losing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Preparations grow yielding the
consequences of wish fulfilments and disappointments to the competitors. This
is the norm underlying this bifurcation. So ignorance is the non-understanding
of the fact that the basis of this <i>attasambhava </i>or springing up from

conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In other words, the ignorance
which gives rise to those preparations that go to create the vortex between
consciousness and name-and-form is the non-understanding of the mutual
interrelation implicit in this vortical interplay. That is why one is
instructed in insight meditation to reflect on preparations relating to
name-and-form. An insight into those preparations reveals this mutual
interrelation. There is such a dichotomy implicit in the term <i>attasambhava.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The commentary explains the
correlative <i>yathonid<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>,
&quot;whence arising&quot;, as a reference to <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>or craving. But it is actually an allusion to
ignorance. The true source is non-understanding. That is why the Buddha, in
presenting the formula of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>, went beyond craving and placed ignorance at the
head of the series of twelve links.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Very often, the commentators
mention this as a possible point of controversy. But the real reason for its
precedence is the fact that ignorance is more primary than craving as a
condition. It is more basic than craving. When one probes into the conditions
for craving, one discovers ignorance as its root. That is why, in stating the
law of <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>icca samupp<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da
</i>in the reverse order, the Buddha used the expression <i>avijj<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya tv'eva asesavir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ganirodh<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[909]</span></span></a>
It is with the cessation of ignorance that the entire series of conditions move
in the opposite direction. So ignorance is primary as a condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We can explain this primacy in
another way. Now <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>is that grasping of the object of craving. Actually it signifies a holding
onto something. What gives the impression that the object of craving is
something that can be grasped is a lack of a deep understanding of the
principle of duality. Craving finds something to hold onto precisely because
one presumes that there actually exists a thing to be grasped. That is how it
gets object status. This way, we can explain the basic reason for the recurrent
birth in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>as
the non-understanding of the mutual interrelation between conditions. This

it a unit. From the point of view of a water pump, it is capable of performing
both functions. It is from this point of view that we attribute a unitary
significance to it. In this very concept of a unit, one can discern the
delusion involved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Delusion is the apex of the
vicious triangle greed, hate and delusion. Greed and hate are the two feelers
directed from the apex delusion. Though we regard them as two functions, the
taking in and throwing out are simply two aspects of the same function. All
this points to the depth of the idea of duality and to the vortex simile, which
our commentarial tradition seems to have ignored.</span></p>

content and concentrated he broke up the point of origin of self like an
armour&quot;. This breaking up of the armour happened not at the moment he
uttered this verse, but at the moment he attained perfect enlightenment. Then
what is the provocation for making such a declaration at this juncture? </span></p>

of duality. For instance, one gazing at a mirror is imperceptibly involved in this
duality when he tries to compare his face with its reflection on the mirror.
This is the irony of the situation in ordinary life. But what we have here, in
this <i>Sutta</i>, is the opposite viewpoint. Not: 'this is mine', not: 'this

objects in the outside world and give them names. It is a burden or a strain to
the mind. The reflection by way of elements as given in the <i>Satipa<span

happened later was to revel in atomistic analyses, which more or less followed
the way of thinking peculiar to materialism. It ended up in hair-splitting
analyses even literally, painting for instance the earth element all the more
vividly in the mind. We have to assess this academic trend against the original
purpose, unbiased by the traditional predilection for it. It is no exaggeration

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>All the meditation techniques the
Buddha has taught are directed towards the fading away of this perception of
form. Because of these four primaries we have a perception of form, which
enables us to take signs. All the four are actually impermanent, but the
perceptual data we have gathered dependent on them are indelibly imprinted on
our minds. Signs taken up in the far distant past in one's <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>can come up
again and again as attachments and aversions to perpetuate one's <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>existence. The
thoughts and prolific concepts arise out of this perception of form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In other words, we distinguish
between one thing and another according to colour and shape. By evaluating them
through attachments and aversions, we allow them to get deeply rooted in our
mind. These are the latencies to perception, which in the <i>Madhupi<span

</i>suffering. In order to loosen the hold of these signs on our minds, the
perilous aspect of the four elements has to be emphasized. That is why the
Buddha in a number of discourses described to the monks the impermanence of the
four elements. It was not his intention to encourage any atomistic analysis. He
preached about the impermanence of the four elements to expose the hollowness
and vanity of this drama of existence </span><span lang=ZH-TW style='font-size:

latencies to perception, productive of existence. It is to eradicate them that
the Buddha has placed before us the story of this great earth in some

years, a savoury earth spread itself over the waters, like the tissue that
forms over hot milk as it cools. It was very sweet and tempting. Some being of

with his finger. Craving arose in him as a result of it. Others who saw him
doing it did the same. </span></p>

the savoury earth with their hands and eating it, with the result that their
subtle bodies became gross, hard and solid. Craving also increased, and their minds
became rougher and coarser. The environment changed in unison, becoming grosser
and grosser. So we have here the perilous aspect. As the perils became
manifest, the watery earth grew in solidity and the simple life grew in
complexity. </span></p>

it without leaving any ash or soot, like in a spot where oil or ghee had burnt.

to perception, amassed through them, persist in us, there is nothing to prevent
us from indulging in thoughts and proliferations. When we reflect on the impermanence

of harming. And where, monks, do these three unskilful thoughts cease without
remainder? For one who dwells with the mind well attended by the four
foundations of mindfulness, or for one who develops the signless concentration.
So much so that this is reason enough for one to develop the signless
concentration. Monks, when the signless concentration is developed and
cultivated it is of great fruit, of great benefit.&quot;</span></p>

developing the signless concentration these thoughts and concepts do not get an

the case of a carpenter, planing a piece of wood. In the process of planing,

his right eye closed might give it a critical glance. There is something
sinister about this way of looking. It is as if an expert is directing a
fault-finding critical glance on the work of an inexpert. But here it is the
carpenter himself looking at his own artefact. Why does he do so? He is himself
playing the role of a critic, in order to find out his shortcomings as a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

&quot;what is the cause, the arising and the origin of thinking?&quot;, and the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the same way, the Buddha goes
on to analyze unhappiness as being twofold. Out of them, that which is

productive of skilful thoughts should be pursued. But therein, too, that which
is unaccompanied by thinking and pondering is declared as more excellent than that

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Sometimes a little problem might
crop up here. In our discussion of the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta
</i>in an earlier sermon, we came across the following statement: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

one proliferates; what one proliferates, owing to that reckonings born of
prolific perception beset him&quot;etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Apparently there is a
contradiction between this statement in the <i>Madhupi<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7693;</span>ikasutta
</i>and the above quoted reply by the Buddha in the <i>SakkapaÃ±hasutta</i>,
where thinking is said to be the cause of desire, and reckonings born of
prolific perception are said to be the cause of thinking. But actually there is
no contradiction, since the raw material for thinking is the set of reckonings
or worldly concepts born of prolific perception. Proliferation only aggravates
the situation by further ramification of concepts, which overwhelm and obsess
the person concerned. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In other words, there is a
peculiar circularity involved in the process. Even for thinking concepts
evolved by prolific perception are utilized. In the course of thinking
proliferation takes over, with the result that those concepts throw up a flush
that tends to overwhelm and obsess the one who initiated the whole process. As
in the case of a fermenting agent, used in the preparation of liquor, there is
a circularity in this proliferation, which makes the confusion in <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra </i>worst
confounded.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in order to break this cycle,
a systematic and gradual approach is needed. That is what the <i>SakkapaÃ±hasutta</i>&nbsp;lays
down. Here is a task that cannot be done slipshod. It is one that calls for
mindfulness and circumspection. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha has described in minor
detail the modus operandi from the rugged outset proceeding by gradual stages
towards subtler and subtler objectives. It is a forked path, where one has to
proceed always keeping to the right, choosing the skilful in preference to the
unskilful, and intuitive in preference to the ratiocinative. So here we have a
wonderfully graded path that combines relativity with pragmatism.</span></p>

some observations about the commentarial explanation of the term <i>avitakkasam<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the commentary, <i>avitakkasam<span

from the second <i>jh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>upwards. This is an
interpretation purely from the <i>samatha</i>&nbsp;or tranquillity standpoint.
The commentary goes on to say that in the present context it means <i>arahattaphalasam<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the light of the foregoing observations on <i>vitakka </i>and <i>papaÃ±ca </i>, <i>avitakkasam<span

aspect of Buddhist meditation. It is not simply a term that connotes all <i>jh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>s devoid of thought, <i>vitakka</i>. It is a term
directly relevant to insight, <i>vipassan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

to temporarily suppress thought, <i>vikkhambhanappah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,
abandonment by suppression. It is the task of insight to dig into the roots of
thinking and clear up the mess, making them ineffective. In other words, it is
of relevance to abandonment by eradication, <i>samucchedappah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
It is in that sense that <i>avitakkasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi </i>stands
for <i>arahattaphalasam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

point further, let us get down to the meaning of this difficult verse. It might
be easier for comprehension if we explain the four lines one by one. The first
line is<i> yassa vitakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> vidh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pit<span

sensuality. The word <i>vidh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;
</span></i>gets the following comment: <i>ariyamaggaÃ±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>ena

of the noble path and fully eradicated&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>However, we happened to mention in
an earlier sermon that the word <i>vidh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pita</i>
has an extremely deep meaning. Particularly in a context where the two words <i>sandh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>peti </i>and <i>vidh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>peti </i>were
found together, we pointed out that the <i>dh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>element
in both words is suggestive of a peculiar ritual connected with incense.<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[951]</span></span></a>
Fragrant incense powder is used for the propitiation of gods, while caustic
types are used for exorcising evil spirits. So <i>vidh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pita</i>
could mean &quot;smoking out&quot; or &quot;expelling&quot; of thoughts in this
context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now as regards the second line, <i>ajjhatta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> suvikappit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ases<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, the commentary takes<i> suvikappit<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>as an equivalent of <i>susamucchinn<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;fully eradicated&quot;. But it is more
likely that the word <i>vikappita </i>basically signifies some form of
&quot;building up&quot;, since it is derived from the root <i>k<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;</span>p, </i>&quot;to make, build, construct, fit out&quot;,
from which Sanskrit words like <i>vikalpa, sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>kalpa,
<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>kalpa </i>and <i>kalpan<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>are
derived. <i>Ajjhatta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> suvikappit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;
</span></i>taken together would therefore mean &quot;well constructed
within&quot;. The second line could now be paraphrased as <i>yassa ajjhatta<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> suvikappit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> vitakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> ases<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> vidh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pit<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, &quot;in whom
thoughts, well constructed within, have been smoked out without residue&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now try to unravel the
meaning of the last two lines, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gam aticca ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>, catuyog<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tigato na j<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tim eti</i>. The commentary explains the word <i>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>as implying
attachment to defilements such as lust, but the attachment meant in this
context is attachment to thoughts, <i>vitakka</i>. <i>Ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gam aticca</i> means having gone beyond the
attachment to thoughts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then comes a term which is even
more abstruse: <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>.
The commentary adopts a queer mode of exegesis here. It says: <i>ruppanasa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>tassa ca vik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rassa tattha abh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vato

lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>a<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> katv<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
<i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> is called <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa
</i>because it is devoid of change that is reckoned as an affliction, <i>ruppana</i>,
and <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>therefore
means 'one who is percipient of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>as
the goal of the path'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is noteworthy that the compound
term <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>
could be analyzed in two ways. One can split it up as <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa
+ saÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>, or as <i>a + r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span></i>, <i>a </i>signifying negation equivalent to <i>na</i>.
In the first case, it gives the meaning &quot;percipient of the immaterial&quot;
realm. In the second case, the meaning is &quot;devoid of perception of
form&quot;. There is a subtle difference between these two possible senses. The
commentarial interpretation prefers the first sense, trying to establish the
term <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>as an epithet for <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> rather arbitrarily. It is the second possible
interpretation that fits the context. <i>Ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>means devoid of <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, <i>a + r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In one of our earlier sermons, we
had occasion to mention that the perception of form is a basic reason for thought

alluded to the following verse in the <i>Ja<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#257;</span>sutta

mention here too in this problematic verse. <i>Arahattaphalasam<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, but a release
from <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>in
toto. As we have already pointed out on an earlier occasion, <i>ar<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>still has the seed of <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>
in it. <i>Ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa </i>is only a shadow of <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i> and presupposes it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Therefore, the reference in this

lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>has a deeper
meaning than that. It implies release from the perception of form, <i>r<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, which
sustains the illusion of permanence and encourages the grasping of signs.
Perception of form and the idea of resistance, <i>pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>igha</i>,
that goes with it, is at the root of this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span

the four yokes, namely those of sensuality, existence, views and ignorance, <i>k<span

Venerable <i>Arahant</i> Subh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ti, who has gone

In this concern, the important issue of thoughts, so relevant to the life of a
meditator, finds an interesting answer. The army of M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra
is, in the last analysis, our thoughts themselves. Generally we take references
to an army of M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra in its gross sense. But in some

There is some imbalance between the two terms <i>bhav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>and <i>vac<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> khar<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, if the commentarial interpretation is granted.
Harsh speech could ill afford to get coupled with influxes of existence to be
cited as fundamental defilements extinct in an <i>arahant</i>. It seems <i>vac<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> khar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>has a deeper
significance than that. It probably means the sediments or dregs (Sanskrit <i>k<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7779;&#257;</span>ra</i>) of speech, namely the worldly concepts
and designations which, as <i>papaÃ±casaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>kh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, reckonings born of
prolific perception, form the basis of all thoughts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>arahant</i>, therefore,
influxes of existence as well as sediments of speech, are smoked out, gone down
and made extinct. This, then, seems to be the most plausible interpretation of
the two lines in question, <i>bhav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> yassa vac<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> khar<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So we have garnered sufficient
canonical evidence to conclude that the terms <i>vitakka </i>and <i>papaÃ±ca </i>are
particularly relevant to the life of a meditator. Also, the fact that the <i>arahattaphalasam<span

shows that the conquest of thoughts is not of a temporary type, as in the case
of tranquillity meditation. On the other hand, it is a transcendence of a more
radical type, through an insight into the relative validity of worldly
concepts, their falsifying nature and the perception of permanence underlying
them. </span></p>

pragmatism and relativity. We also made an attempt to understand why the <i>arahattaphalasam<span

non-prolific state by gradually attenuating cravings, conceits and views, comes

thirty-six objects of sense, out of which we brought up, as a paradigm, the

the thirty-six pathways of beings,<i> chatti<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>sa
sattapad<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, in the sense that they depict the
thought patterns of beings. In this discourse, the Buddha proclaims the basic
maxim he employs in gradually channelling the thought processes of beings
towards <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>along these thirty-six
pathways. The maxim is summed up in the following words: <i>tatra ida<span

application of the same formula. In the context of the path of practice, the
dependence on one thing is for the purpose of abandoning another. There is an
attitude of detachment in this course of practice. Based on this maxim, the Buddha
outlines the way in which he guides one towards <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
in four stages. The first stage in that gradual path towards <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

renunciation remain. That is the position at the end of the first stage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then, in the second stage, a
subtler and more refined level of experience is aimed at. Out of the three
types of mental states based on renunciation, firstly, the six kinds of
unhappiness based on renunciation are abandoned by the six kinds of happiness
based on renunciation. Then the six kinds of happiness based on renunciation
are abandoned by the six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To the extent that all the above
three mental states are based on renunciation, they are of a piece with each other.
Also, it is the same mode of insightful reflection that gives rise to them.
However, as attitudes, happiness is subtler and more excellent than
unhappiness, and equanimity is subtler and more excellent than happiness, since
it is nearer to wisdom. So in the second stage we see a gradual procedure
arriving at a subtler and more excellent state even in the case of those three
mental states based on renunciation. By the end of the second stage, only
equanimity based on renunciation remains. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now comes the third stage. Here
the Buddha points out that in the case of equanimity there can be two
varieties. <i>Atthi, bhikkhave, upekkh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> n<span

is, monks, an equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and there is
an equanimity that is unified, based on unity&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>What is that equanimity that is
diversified? It is defined as the equanimity regarding the objects of the five
external senses, that is to say, equanimity regarding forms, sounds, smells,
flavours and tangibles. Equanimity that is unified is defined with reference to
the immaterial realms, namely the sphere of infinity of space, the sphere of
infinity of consciousness, the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in the case of these two types
of equanimity, the Buddha points out a way of abandoning the equanimity based
on diversity with the help of the equanimity based on unity. As equanimity both
types are commendable, but that which is diversified and based on diversity is
grosser. Equanimity that is unified and based on unity is subtler and more
excellent. So the equanimity based on diversity is abandoned and transcended by
the equanimity that is unified, based on unity. This is the end of the third
stage.</span></p>

with only that equanimity that is based on unity. It is experienced in the

course of action. In fact, it is here that the deepest practical hint is given.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

point. A good man reflects wisely according to the advice given by the Buddha
to the effect that even to the higher <i>jh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nic </i>attainment
of neither-perception-nor-non-perception the principle of non-identification
must be applied, recalling the maxim made known by the Buddha: <i>Yena yena hi
maÃ±Ã±anti tato ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> hoti aÃ±Ã±atha</i>, &quot;in
whatever way they imagine, thereby it turns otherwise&quot;. </span></p>

<i>MaÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>is egoistic imagining. When one thinks
in egoistic terms about something, by that very me-thinking it turns otherwise.
Due to egoistic imagining, it becomes a thing, and once it becomes a thing, it
is bound to change and become another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The good man calls to mind that
maxim, that norm, and refrains from exalting himself and disparaging others on
account of his attainment. He does not identify himself with it. From this it
becomes clear that <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257; </span></i>or <b>non-identification
is the path to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i></b>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

channelizes the pathways of thoughts of beings from the grosser to subtler
levels and finally tops up by directing them to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
through non-identification, <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
Non-identification is the watchword for clinging-free <i>parinibb<span

in the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>yatanavibha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta</i>,
portrays a duality between attention, <i>manasik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>,
and inattention, <i>amanasik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>. That is to
say, the basic principle in this dictum is the method of encouraging
inattention to grosser things by recommending a way of attending to subtler
things. So it seems both attention and inattention are given an importance in
this procedure. In order to eliminate one thing by inattention, attention to
some other thing is recommended. For the purpose of inattention to something
gross, attention to something subtle is taken up. But that is not the end of
it. Even that is expelled with the help of something subtler. Here we have a
wonderful technique, based on the twin principles of pragmatism and relativity.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These two terms comprehend the
entire gamut of the path of practice in Buddhism. 'Pragmatic' means 'for some
practical purpose', 'relative' means 'in relation to something else', that is,
as a means to an end, and not absolutely as an end in itself. So in this system
of practice everything has a pragmatic and a relative value. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

point of this simile. When, for instance, a carpenter, in fitting out a door,
finds that he is driving a blunt nail, he extracts it with the help of a
sharper one. He takes up the sharper nail just for the purpose of extracting
the blunt nail. So also one resorts to a skilful thought to expel the unskilful
thought as a means to an end. This kind of pragmatic and relative approach
avoids tenacious grasping and dogmatic involvement. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The spirit of the law of dependent

also deserve our special attention in this context. The basic meaning of <i>kusala
</i>is &quot;skilful&quot;, and <i>akusala </i>means &quot;unskilful&quot;.
Here, again, we have something relative. 'Skilful' presupposes 'unskilful' and
gets a value in relation to the latter. It has no absolute value. We make use
of the skilful in order to push away the unskilful. That done, there is no
further involvement with it, as one's last resort is <i>atammayat<span

problem of a clogging coming in.</span></p>

religious systems the question of reality is resolved by having recourse to
unity. Oneness is supposed to be the ultimate goal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In our analysis of the <i>sa<span

often referred to a duality or a dichotomy. Everywhere we were confronted with
a duality. But to grasp the two as one, in some form of oneness, is not the way
out. Instead we have here, as the final solution, <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>
or non-identification, a clinging-free approach in the last analysis.</span></p>

beings find themselves bound and fettered. These fetters are called <i>sa<span

The term <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>

notion of a duality comes in <span lang=ZH-TW>&#8213;</span> one who holds and
the thing held. It is not at all easy to transcend this duality, characteristic
of <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>existence.

flood reveals some salient features of the middle path. If a person caught up
in a water current tries to stay still, he will sink. If he simply struggles to
escape, he will get swept away. So like a good swimmer, he has to avoid both
extremes, and, by means of a mindful and systematic gradual effort, work out
his freedom. In other words, he has to strive <span lang=ZH-TW>&#8213;</span>
not struggle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So we can understand why the
Buddha in his very first sermon, <i>Dhammacakkapavattanasutta</i>,
&quot;Discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of <i>Dhamma</i>&quot;, proclaimed
as the middle path the noble eightfold path, avoiding both extremes of
attachment to sensuality, <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masukhallik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nuyoga</i>, and self-mortification, <i>attakilamath<span

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[974]</span></span></a>
Here, too, the implication is that the entire round of existence is a water
current to be crossed over by means of a systematic and gradual effort. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In some of our earlier sermons,
while analyzing the law of dependent arising, we made use of the simile of the
vortex for easy comprehension.<a name="_ednref975"></a><a href="#_edn975"

Now if we are to take it up again, we may say that it is in the nature of
beings in <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ra</i>
to get drifted by the current of preparations, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>kh<span

ignorance, <i>avijj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, and go on revolving
between consciousness, <i>viÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>, and
name-and-form, <i>n<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma-r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This ignorance in the form of the
four pervert perceptions Ã namely the perception of permanence in the
impermanent, the perception of pleasure in the painful, the perception of
beauty in the repulsive, and the perception of self in the not-self Ã gives
rise to the run-away current of water which keeps running round and round
between consciousness and name-and-form. This is the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>vortex, <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rava<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>a</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, for instance, if we throw
even a small leaf to a spot where there is a vortex, it also keeps revolving.
Similarly, all over this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric
</i>existence duality holds sway. Therefore, freedom from it can be won only by
a subtle form of striving. That is why the Buddha used the two terms<i> appati<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; </span></i>and<i> an<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>y<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>ha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>.
Avoiding the two extremes of stagnation and struggling, one has to cross the
flood going the middle way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

these verses, we followed the reading <i>visuddhi</i>, whereas some editions
accept the reading <i>na suddhim <span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ha</i>, where
the negative seems superfluous.<i> Visuddhi </i>seems more meaningful here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The commentarial explanation of
these two verses seems to go off at a tangent.<a name="_ednref977"></a><a
href="#_edn977" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[977]</span></span></a> It says that the negatives in
the first two lines of the Buddha's reply refer to wrong views, wrong learning,
wrong knowledge, wrong virtue and wrong vows, and that the third and fourth
lines refer to right view, right learning, right knowledge, right virtue and
right vows. In other words, it is only a question of wrong view, <i>micch<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>, and
right view, <i>samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This interpretation misses the
subtle point at issue in this dialogue. If it is as simple as that, there is no
ground for M<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gandiya's accusation. Other religious
teachers, who disputed with each other, used to assert that purity is attained
only by their views, learning, knowledge, virtue and vows. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here then it is not a question of
difference between <i>micch<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi
</i>and <i>samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>.
Here is something more radical concerning <i>samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi </i>itself. According to this
enlightened approach, views etc. cannot totally be dispensed with, nor are they
to be grasped. We come back now to the two key words 'pragmatic' and
'relative'. That is why the Buddha declared that purity cannot be attained by
views, learning, knowledge, virtue and vows, nor in the absence of these
qualities. </span></p>

dialogue is that the holy life is not lived under the Fortunate One for the

two of the dialogue, Venerable S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta
highlights the contradictions in the answers given so far, somewhat like M<span

clarification. He asks: &quot;But, friend, is purification of virtue perfect <i>Nibb<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

negative. Then Venerable S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta asks: </span></p>

of contradictions has come to a head. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now in part three of the dialogue
we find Venerable S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>riputta rhetorically summing
up the previous section of the dialogue: &quot;When asked: 'But, friend, is
purification of virtue perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without
clinging?', you replied: 'No friend'&quot; (and so on), citing even the last
negative response: &quot;And when asked: 'But, friend, is perfect <i>Nibb<span

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>without
these states?', you replied: 'No friend'&quot;; and rounds up by asking with
apparent exasperation: <i>yath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>katha<span

statement?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So rather dramatically the stage
is now set for Venerable Pu<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a Mant<span

discussion:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>pessa. </span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Friend, if the Fortunate One
had designated purification of virtue as perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>without clinging, he would have designated what is still accompanied by
clinging as perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without
clinging.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the same strain, he goes on to
apply this criterion to the other stages of purification and finally brings out
the absurdity of the other extreme in the following words:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>AÃ±Ã±atra ce, <span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vuso,

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;And
if, friend, perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without
clinging were to be attained without these states, then even an ordinary
worldling would have attained perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without
clinging, for an ordinary worldling, friend, is without these states.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now we can see how subtle this
question is. Simply because it was said that none of the above states is
perfect <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without clinging, they cannot
be dispensed with. We have already discussed the significance of the <i>Alagadd<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pamasutta </i>in this concern. There we came across two
similes, the simile of the raft and the simile of the water snake. To carry the
raft on one's shoulder after crossing is one extreme.<a name="_ednref981"></a><a
href="#_edn981" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[981]</span></span></a> To take the water snake by its
tail is the other extreme. The middle path lies between these two extremes.
That is the implication of the above statement that if perfect <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>without clinging is attained without these
states, then even an ordinary worldling would have attained it, for he has none
of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>For further clarification of this
point, Venerable Pu<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a Mant<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>iputta comes out with the simile of the relay of
chariots. King Pasendi of Kosala, while living in S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vatth<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>, has some urgent business to settle at S<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>keta. Between S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vatth<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span> and S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>keta seven relay
chariots are kept ready for him. The king mounts the first relay chariot and by
means of it arrives at the second relay chariot. Then he dismounts from the
first relay chariot and mounts the second chariot. By means of the second
chariot he arrives at the third chariot. In this way, finally he arrives at S<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>keta by means of the seventh chariot. Then, when his
friends and relatives in S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>keta ask him: 'Sire,
did you come from S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vatth<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>
to S<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>keta by means of this chariot?', he cannot
reply in the affirmative. He has to relate the whole story of passing from
chariot to chariot. </span></p>

illustration, Venerable Pu<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#7751;</span>a Mant<span

of this dramatic exposition is <i>y<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vad eva</i>.
Simply rendered it means &quot;just for&quot;, that is, the sufficing condition

principles of pragmatism and relativity. In the light of the illustration by
relay chariots, this watchword stands for that impersonal momentum or impetus
required for any gradual course of purposive action, according to the law of
dependent arising.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So we see how the Buddha
discovered and laid bare the first principles of a universal law conducive to
one's emancipation. Here is a series of states, in which one state is to be
made use of for reaching another, and that for reaching yet another, but none
of which is to be grasped per se. This is the distinction between what is
called <i>upadhi</i>, or <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric

there is a different approach. One state leads up to another, and that to yet
another, in accordance with the simile of the relay chariots, but none of them
is to be grasped per se. One grasps neither purification of virtue, nor
purification of the mind, nor purification of view, nay, not even purification
by knowledge and vision. Leaving them all behind and reaching the subtlest of

of sermons we made allusions to this simile in brief on several occasions, but
let us now try to examine this simile in more detail. In order to present the
parable of the raft, the Buddha addressed the monks and made the following

comparable to a raft for crossing over and not for grasping.&quot; With this
introductory declaration, he goes on to relate the parable of the raft. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Monks, suppose a man in the
course of a long journey, saw a great expanse of water whose near shore was
dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and free from fear. But
there was no ferry boat or bridge going to the far shore. Then he thought: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

together into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with my
hands and feet I were to get safely across to the far shore'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>And then the man collected grass,
sticks, branches and leaves and bound them together into a raft, and supported
by the raft and making an effort with his hands and feet he got safely across
to the far shore. Then, when he got safely across and had arrived at the far
shore he might think thus: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>'This raft has been very helpful
to me, supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely
across to the far shore. Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my
shoulder and then go wherever I want.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now, monks, what do you think, by doing
so would that man be doing what should be done with that raft?&quot; &quot;No,
Venerable Sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;By doing what would that man
be doing what should be done with that raft? Here, monks, when that man got
across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: 'This raft has
been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an effort with my
hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to haul it
on dry land or set it adrift in the water and then go wherever I want.' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now it is by so doing that that
man would be doing what should be done with the raft. Even so, monks, I have
shown you how the <i>Dhamma </i>is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of
crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.&quot; And the Buddha concludes
with the significant statement: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Kull<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pama<span

"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>. &quot;Monks, when you know the <i>Dhamma </i>to
be similar to a raft, you should abandon even good states, how much more so bad
states&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So it seems, this raft simile has
a very deep meaning. The building of the raft by the person wishing to cross
symbolizes the pragmatic and relative values we highlighted in connection with
the path of practice leading to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
The raft improvised with self effort is not for grasping or carrying on one's
shoulder. As we have already pointed out with reference to such discourses like
<i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7735;&#257;</span>yatanavibha<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>gasutta</i>,
apart from the purpose of crossing, there is nothing worth holding on to or
grasping. Why so? Because the aim of this holy life or this path of practice is
non-grasping instead of grasping; non-identification, <i>atammayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, instead of identification, <i>tammayat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>; assetlessness, <i>nirupadhi</i>, instead of
assets, <i>upadhi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The importance attached to this
simile is so much that the Buddha reminds the monks of it in the <i>Mah<span

to the letter and to the spirit, excellent in the beginning, excellent in the

makes them, too, the object of mindfulness. This gradual process need not be

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This is the right endeavour
regarding skilful mental states. Why we refer to this aspect in particular is
that there is at present a tendency among those who recommend <i>satipa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>&nbsp;meditation
to overemphasize the role of attention. They seem to assert that bare attention
or noticing is all that is needed. The reason for such an attitude is probably
the attempt to specialize in <i>satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>in isolation, without reference to the rest of
the thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These seven tool-kits are
interconnected. From the <i>satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>tool-kit, the <i>sammappadh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na
</i>tool-kit comes out as a matter of course. That is why bare attention is not
the be all and end all of it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Proper attention is actually the
basis for right endeavour. Even when a machine is out of order, there is a need
for tightening or loosening somewhere. But first of all one has to mindfully
scan or scrutinize it. That is why there is no explicit reference to effort in
the <i>Satipa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nasutta</i>.
But based on that scrutiny, the four right endeavours play their role in regard
to unskilful and skilful mental states. So we see the close relationship
between the four foundations of mindfulness and the four right endeavours. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is also interesting to examine
the relationship between the four right endeavours and the four paths to
success. We have already quoted a phrase that is commonly used with reference
to all the four right endeavours, namely <i>chanda<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
janeti v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yamati viriya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>rabhati

effort, puts forth energy, makes firm the mind and endeavours&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Here we have a string of terms
suggestive of striving, systematically arranged in an ascending order. <i>Chanda<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> janeti </i>refers to the interest or the desire to
act. <i>V<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yamati</i> suggests effort or exercise. <i>Viriya<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>rabhati</i> has to do with the initial
application of energy. <i>Citta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pagga<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i> stands for that
firmness of resolve or grit. <i>Padahati </i>signifies the final all out effort
or endeavour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>These terms more or less delineate
various stages in a progressive effort. One who practices the four right
endeavours in course of time specializes in one or the other of the four bases
for success, <i>iddhip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>. That is why the
four bases for success are traceable to the four right endeavours. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>To illustrate the connection
between the right endeavours and the four bases for success, let us take up a
simile. Suppose there is a rock which we want to get out of our way. We wish to
topple it over. Since our wishing it away is not enough, we put some kind of
lever underneath it and see whether it responds to our wish. Even if the rock
is unusually obstinate, we at least give our shoulders an exercise, <i>v<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yamati</i>, in preparation for the effort. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Once we are ready, we heave slowly
slowly, <i>viriya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>rabhati</i>. But then it
looks as if the rock is precariously balanced, threatening to roll back. So we
grit our teeth and make a firm resolve,<i> citta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
pagga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti</i>. Now
comes the last decisive spurt. With one deep breath, well aware that it could
be our last if the rock had its own way, we push it away with all our might. It
is this last all out endeavour that in the highest sense is called <i>sammappadh<span

it is easy to mistake it as a base for psychic power. But the basic sense of <i>iddhi</i>
is &quot;success&quot; or &quot;proficiency&quot;. For instance, <i>samiddhi</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the course of our last sermon,
we took up the position that the seven groups of doctrinal categories
collectively known as the thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment
follow an extremely practical and systematic order of arrangement. By way of
proof, we discussed at some length the inner consistency evident within each
group and the way the different groups are related to each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So far, we have pointed out how
the setting up of mindfulness through the four foundations of mindfulness
serves as a solid basis for the four ways of putting forth energy, by the four
right endeavours; and how the progressive stages in putting forth energy,
outlined by the four right endeavours, give rise to the four bases for success.
It was while discussing the way in which the four bases for success are helpful
in arousing the five faculties, like faith, that we had to stop our last
sermon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It should be sufficiently clear,
after our discussion the other day, that the four factors desire, energy,
determination and investigation could be made the base for success in any
venture. The five faculties, however, are directly relevant to <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. That is why faith is given pride of place among
the faculties. <i>Saddhindriya</i>, or the faculty of faith, takes the lead,
which is obviously related to <i>chanda</i>, desire or interest. But the
element of faith in <i>saddhindriya</i> is defined at a higher level. In this
context, it is reckoned as the firm faith characteristic of the stream-winner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

this context is that element of energy weathered and reinforced by its fourfold
application as a base for success, <i>iddhip<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>da</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

</i>in the description of the development of the bases for success. The
concentration meant by <i>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i> in that
context is actually a one-pointedness of the mind, <i>cittekaggat<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, which could be made the basis for arousing
energy. But the level of concentration envisaged by the concentration faculty, <i>sam<span

potential is concerned. It is defined as the first four <i>jh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nas</i>,

four noble truths. Sometimes it is called the &quot;noble penetrative wisdom of
rise and fall&quot;, <i>udayatthag<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>min<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, investigation, we
came across in our discussion of the bases for success. As a faculty, it comes
out full-fledged in the guise of wisdom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The mindfulness faculty, which
stands in the middle, fulfils a very important function. Now in the context of
the four foundations of mindfulness, the role of mindfulness is the simple task
of being aware of the appropriate object presented to it. But here in this
domain of faculties, mindfulness has attained lordship and fulfils an important
function. It maintains the balance between the two sets of pair-wise faculties,
by equalizing faith with wisdom and energy with concentration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This function of balancing of
faculties, which mindfulness fulfils, has a special practical value. To one who
is striving for <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, balancing of
faculties could sometimes be an intricate problem, since it is more easily said
than done. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In order to unravel this problem,
let us take up the simile of the rock, we employed the other day. We discussed
the question of toppling a rock as an illustration to understand the various
stages in the four-fold right endeavour. We distinguished the five stages in
putting forth effort in the phrase <i>chanda<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
janeti, v<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yamati, viriya<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747; &#257;</span>rabhati,
citta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> pagga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ti, padahati </i>with the help of that illustration.
Out of these stages, the last one represented by the word <i>padahati</i> shows
the climax. <i>Padh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i> or endeavour is the
highest grade of effort. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Even verbally it implies something
like toppling a rock, which requires a high degree of momentum. This momentum
has to be built up mindfully and gradually. That rock, in our illustration, was
levered up with great difficulty. After it was levered up, there came that
dangerous situation, when it threatened to roll back. It called for that
supreme purposeful effort, which required the zeal of self sacrifice. That
zealous endeavour is made at the risk of one's body and life. But even there,
one has to be cautious and mindful. If excessive energy is applied in that last
heave, one would be thrown off head over heels after the rock. If insufficient
energy is applied the rock would roll back and one would get crushed. That is
why a balancing is needed before the last spurt. Right endeavour has to be
preceded by a balancing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is this preliminary balancing
that finds mention in a certain highly significant statement in the <i>Ca<span

Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, where we are told how a person arouses
faith in the <i>Dhamma</i> and gradually develops it and puts forth effort and
endeavour and attains <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. To quote the
relevant section of that long sentence: <i>chandaj<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

the context here, as it occurs between <i>ussahati</i>, &quot;strives&quot;
(literally &quot;bearing up&quot; or &quot;enduring&quot;), and <i>padahati</i>,
&quot;endeavours&quot;, the obvious meaning is &quot;equalizing&quot; or
&quot;balancing&quot;. <i>Tuleti </i>has connotations of weighing and judging,
and one who strives to lift up a rock needs to know how heavy it is and how
much effort is required to topple it. By merely looking at the rock, without
trying to lift it up, one cannot say how much effort is needed to topple it.
One has to put one's shoulder to it. In fact the word <i>ussahati</i> is
suggestive of enduring effort with which one bears up. </span></p>

designate that steadily enduring effort - literally, the bearing up. A clear
instance of the occurrence of this term in this sense can be found among the
Eights of the <i>A<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>guttara Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya
</i>in a discourse on the recollection of death, <i>mara<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>asati</i>.
The <i>Sutta</i> is an exhortation to the monks to make use of the recollection
of death to reflect on one's unskilful mental states daily in the morning and
in the evening with a view to strengthen one's determination to abandon them.

to clarify the idea of balancing, prior to the final endeavour, we may take the
case of lifting a log of wood. Here we have an actual lifting up or putting
one's shoulder to it. Without lifting up a log of wood and putting one's
shoulder to it, one cannot get to know the art of balancing. If, for instance,
the log of wood is thick at one end and thin at the other end, one cannot
locate the centre of gravity at a glance. So one puts one's shoulder to one end
and goes on lifting it up. It is when one reaches the centre of gravity that
one is able to balance it on one's shoulder and take it away. It is because we
are looking at this question of balancing of faculties from a practical point
of view that we made this detour in explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

is also performing a very important function among these faculties. From the <i>Saddh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sutta </i>we quoted the other day we could see that there
is also a gradual arrangement in this group of five faculties. That is to say,
in a person with faith, energy arises. One who is energetic is keen on
developing mindfulness. In one who is mindful, concentration grows; and one who
has concentration attains wisdom. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>This gradual arrangement becomes
all the more meaningful since the faculty of wisdom is declared the chief among
the faculties. In the <i>Indriya Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta </i>of
the <i>Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>
the Buddha gives a number of similes to show that the wisdom faculty is supreme
in this group. Just as the lion is supreme among animals, and the footprint of
the elephant is the biggest of all footprints, the wisdom faculty is supreme
among faculties.<a name="_ednref1017"></a><a href="#_edn1017" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[1017]</span></span></a>
The Buddha even goes on to point out that until the wisdom faculty steps in,
the other four faculties do not get established. This he makes clear by the
simile of the gabled hall in the <i>Mallikasutta </i>of the <i>Indriya Sa<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

hall, so long as the roof peak has not been raised, the rafters are not

the five faculties do not get established in him, since the wisdom faculty is

eight noble persons, the four treading on the paths to the four fruits and the

harnessed. It is in the <i>arahant </i>that the wisdom faculty is found in its
strongest form. In the other grades of supramundane attainment, they are weaker
by degrees. The lowest grade is the one treading the path to stream-winning. In
the worldling they are not at all to be found, in any way, <i>sabbena sabba<span

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Next comes the group of five
powers. As to their function, some explanation might be necessary, though it
seems simple enough. As we have already mentioned, the term&nbsp;<i>indriya </i>connotes
kingship or lordship. Faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom were
elevated to the position of a king or lord. They have attained sovereignty. So
now they are exercising their power. For what purpose? To put down the evil
unskilful mental states that rise in revolt against <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>.
The noble disciple uses the same faculties as powers to fight out the
hindrances and break the fetters. That is why among the participative factors
of enlightenment they are represented as powers, by virtue of their special
function. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then we come to the category
called seven factors of enlightenment. A high degree of importance is attached
to this particular group. It has an orderly arrangement. The constituents are: <i>sati</i>,
mindfulness; <i>dhammavicaya</i>, investigation of states; <i>viriya</i>,
energy; <i>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ti</i>, joy; <i>passaddhi</i>,
calmness; <i>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi</i>, concentration; <i>upekkh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, equanimity. In this group of seven, mindfulness
takes precedence. In fact, the arrangement resembles the mobilization for
winning that freedom of <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. The <i>bojjha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>g<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, factors of

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'> leads the
way and at the same time marshals the squad. Three members of the group, namely
<i>dhammavicaya, viriya </i>and <i>p<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>ti</i> are by
nature restless, while the other three, <i>passaddhi, sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dhi
</i>and <i>upekkh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i> are rather slack. They have
to be marshalled and properly aligned, and <i>sati </i>comes to the forefront
for that purpose. At the same time, one can discern an orderly arrangement
within this group. Right from the stage of the four foundations of mindfulness,
the same term <i>sati </i>seems to occur down the line, but its function differs
in different contexts. Now in this context, it is specifically called a <i>bojjha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ga</i>, a factor of enlightenment. The phrase <i>satisambojjha<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>veti</i>,

implies. To one who has stirred up energy, there arises a joy of the spiritual
type, <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>raddhaviriyassa uppajjati p<span

one who is calm in body and blissful gets concentrated, <i>passaddhak<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So now the enlightenment factor of
concentration has also come up. What comes after the enlightenment factor of
concentration is the enlightenment factor of equanimity. About it, it is said: <i>so
tath<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sam<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>hita<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> hoti, </i>&quot;he rightly looks on with equanimity at
the mind thus concentrated&quot;. Once the mind is concentrated, there is no
need to struggle or strive. With equanimity one has to keep watch and ward over
it. As an enlightenment factor, equanimity can be evalued from another angle.
It is the proper basis for the knowledge of things as they are, <i>yath<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>taÃ±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;&#7751;</span>a</i>.
The neutrality that goes with equanimity not only stabilizes concentration, but
also makes one receptive to the knowledge of things as they are. So here we
have the seven factors conducive to enlightenment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

mere citation of apparent synonyms for an academic purpose. It brings out the
fact that at the path moment the essence of all the wisdom that systematically
got developed through the five faculties, the five powers and the seven

breakthrough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The two-fold definition given by
the Buddha is common to the first five factors of the path: right view, right
thought, right speech, right action and right livelihood. That is to say, all
these factors have an aspect that can be called &quot;tinged with
influxes&quot;, <i>sa-<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sava</i>, &quot;on the side
of merit&quot;, <i>puÃ±Ã±abh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>giya</i>, and

&quot;a constituent factor of the path&quot;,<i> magga<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7749;</span>ga</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The usual definition of the noble
eightfold path is well known. A question might arise as to the part played by
right speech, right action and right livelihood at the arising of the
supramundane path. Their role at the path moment is described as an abstinence
from the four kinds of verbal misconduct, an abstinence from the three kinds of
bodily misconduct, and an abstinence from wrong livelihood. The element of
abstinence therein implied is conveyed by such terms as <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>rati
virati pa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ivirati verama<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#299;</span></i>,
&quot;desisting from, abstaining, refraining, abstinence&quot;. It is the very
thought of abstaining that represents the three factors at the path moment and
not their physical counterparts. That is to say, the act of refraining has
already been accomplished. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So then we are concerned only with
the other five factors of the path. Out of them, three factors are highlighted
as running around and circling around each of these five for the purpose of
their fulfilment, namely right view, right effort and right mindfulness. This
running around and circling around, conveyed by the two terms <i>anuparidh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>vanti </i>and <i>anuparivattanti</i>, is extremely
peculiar in this context. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The role of these three states
might be difficult for one to understand. Perhaps, as an illustration, we may
take the case of a VIP, a very important person, being conducted through a
crowd with much pomp. One ushers him in with his vanguard, another brings up
the rear with his bandwagon while yet another is at hand as the
bodyguard-cum-attendant. So also at the path moment right view shows the way,
right effort gives the boost, while right mindfulness attends at hand. </span></p>

wrong side, <i>micch<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, of the path factors in
check. The precedence of right view is a salient feature of the noble eightfold
path. The Buddha makes special mention of it, pointing out at the same time the
inner consistency of its internal arrangement. </span></p>

eightfold path begins with right view. This precedence of view is not to be
found in the other groups of participative factors of enlightenment. The reason
for this peculiarity is the fact that view has to come first in any total

view. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A view gives rise to thoughts,
thoughts issue in words, words lead to actions, and actions mould a livelihood.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The fundamental importance of the
noble eightfold path could be assessed from another point of view. It gains a
high degree of recognition due to the fact that the Buddha has styled it as the
middle path. For instance, in the <i>Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</i>, the
discourse on the turning of the wheel, the middle path is explicitly defined as
the noble eightfold path. It is sufficiently well known that the noble
eightfold path has been called the middle path by the Buddha. But the basic
idea behind this definition has not always been correctly understood. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>Dhammacakkappavattanasutta</i>
the Buddha has presented the noble eightfold path as a middle path between the
two extremes called <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>masukhallik<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nuyogo</i>, the pursuit of sensual pleasure, and <i>attakilamath<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The concept of a 'middle' might
make one think that the noble eightfold path is made up by borrowing fifty per
cent from each of the two extremes, the pursuit of sense pleasures and the
pursuit of self-mortification. But it is not such a piecemeal solution. There
are deeper implications involved. The <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>catt<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>sakasutta</i> in
particular brings out the true depth of this middle path. Instead of grafting
half of one extreme to half of the other, the Buddha rejected the wrong views
behind both those pursuits and, avoiding the pitfalls of both, presented anew a
middle path in the form of the noble eightfold path. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>By way of clarification, we may
draw attention to the fact that one inclines to the pursuit of sense pleasures
by taking one's stance on the annihilationist view. It amounts to the idea that
there is no rebirth and that one can indulge in sense pleasures unhindered by
ethical considerations of good and evil. It inculcates a nihilistic outlook
characterized by a long line of negatives. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In contradistinction to it, we
have the affirmative standpoint forming the lower grade of the right view
referred to above, namely the right view which takes <i>kamma </i>as one's own,
<i>kammasakat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> samm<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>
di<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;&#7789;</span>hi</i>. The positive outlook in this right
view inculcates moral responsibility and forms the basis for skilful or
meritorious deeds. That is why it is called <i>puÃ±Ã±abh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>giya,</i>
on the side of merits. By implication, the nihilistic outlook, on the other
hand, is on the side of demerit, lacking a basis for skilful action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In our analysis of the law of
dependent arising, also, we happened to mention the idea of a middle path. But
that is from the philosophical standpoint. Here we are concerned with the
ethical aspect of the middle path. As far as the ethical requirements are
concerned, a nihilistic view by itself does not entitle one to deliverance.
Why? Because the question of influxes is there to cope with. So long as the
influxes of sensuality, <i>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, of becoming, <i>bhav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, are there, one cannot escape the consequences of
action merely by virtue of a nihilistic view. That is why the Buddha took a
positive stand on those ten postulates. Where the nihilist found an excuse for
indulgence in sensuality by negating, the Buddha applied a corrective by
asserting. This affirmative stance took care of one extremist trend. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>But the Buddha did not stop there.
In the description of the higher grade of right view we came across the terms <i>ariy<span

here it is <i>an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
influx-free. At whatever moment the mind develops that strength to withstand
the influxes, one is not carried away by worldly conventions. That is why the
right view at the supramundane path moment is called influx-free. There is an
extremely subtle point involved in this distinction. This noble influx-free
right view, that is a constituent of the supramundane path, <i>ariy<span

lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ihita</i>, and the void,&nbsp;<i>suÃ±Ã±ata</i>. We have
already discussed at length about them in our previous sermons. Perhaps, while
listening to them, some might have got scared at the thought 'so then there is
not even a mother or a father'. That is why the word <i>suÃ±Ã±at<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
voidness, drives terror into those who do not understand it properly. Here we
see the depth of the Buddha's middle path. That right view with influxes, sa-<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sav<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>, is on the side of
merits, <i>puÃ±Ã±abh<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>giya</i>, not demerit, <i>apuÃ±Ã±a.
</i>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>If the Buddha sanctions demerit, he
could have endorsed the nihilistic view that there is no this world or the
other world, no mother or father. But due to the norm of <i>kamma</i> which he
explained in such terms as <i>kammassak<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> satt<span

ignorance and craving are there, beings take their stand on convention and go
on accumulating <i>kamma.</i> They have to pay for it. They have to suffer the
consequences. </span></p>

the conditions in life conducive even to the attainment of <i>Nibb<span

nihilistic view, although it is of a second grade. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

of the <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>problem.
One cannot afford to stagnate there. There should be a release from it as a
permanent solution. That is where the higher grade of right view comes in, the
noble influx-free right view which occurs as a factor of the path. It is then
that the terms <i>animitta</i>, signless, <i>appa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>ihita</i>,
the undirected and&nbsp;<i>suÃ±Ã±ata</i>, the void, become meaningful. </span></p>

the concept of a middle path could sometimes give rise to doubts and
indecision. One might wonder whether one should strive hard or lead a
comfortable life. A midway solution between the two might be taken as the
middle path. But the true depth of the middle path emerges from the above
analysis of the twofold definition of the noble eightfold path. It is because
of this depth of the middle path that the Buddha made the following declaration
in the <i>Aggappas<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dasutta </i>of the <i>A<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is true that the noble
eightfold path is something prepared and that is why we showed its relation to
causes and conditions. Whatever is prepared is not worthwhile, and yet, it is
by means of this prepared noble eightfold path that the Buddha clears the path
to the unprepared. This is an extremely subtle truth, which only a Buddha can
discover and proclaim to the world. It is not easy to discover it, because one
tends to confuse issues by going to one extreme or another. One either resorts
to the annihilationist view and ends up by giving way to indulgence in
sensuality, or inclines towards the eternalist view and struggles to extricate
self by self-mortification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In the <i>Dhamma </i>proclaimed by
the Buddha one can see a marvellous middle way. We have already pointed it out
in earlier sermons by means of such illustrations as sharpening a razor. There
is a remarkable attitude of non-grasping about the middle path, which is well
expressed by the term <i>atammayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
non-identification. Relying on one thing is just for the purpose of eliminating
another, as exemplified by the simile of the relay of chariots. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The key terms signifying the aim
and purpose of this middle path are <i>vivekanissita<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
vir<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ganissita<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>
nirodhanissita<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vossaggapari<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;&#257;</span>mi<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span></i>, &quot;based upon seclusion, dispassion and
cessation, maturing in release&quot;. Placed in this <i>sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>s<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ric </i>predicament, one cannot help resorting to
certain things to achieve this aim. But care is taken to see that they are not
grasped or clung to. It is a process of pushing away one thing with another,
and that with yet another, a via media based on relativity and pragmatism. The
noble eightfold path marks the consummation of this process, its systematic
fulfilment. That is why we tried to trace a process of a gradual development
among the thirty-seven participative factors of enlightenment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Even the internal arrangement
within each group is extraordinary. There is an orderly arrangement from
beginning to end in an ascending order of importance. Sometimes, an analysis
could start from the middle and extend to either side. Some groups portray a
gradual development towards a climax. The noble eightfold path is exceptionally
striking in that it indicates how a complete transformation of personality
could be effected by putting right view at the head as the forerunner. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Perhaps the most impressive among
discourses in which the Buddha highlighted the pervasive significance of the
noble eightfold path is the <i><span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;</span>k<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sasutta</i>,
&quot;Sky <i>Sutta</i>&quot;,<i> </i>in the <i>Magga Sa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutta

winds blow in the sky, easterly winds, westerly winds, northerly winds,
southerly winds, dusty winds, dustless winds, cold winds and hot winds, gentle
winds and strong winds; so too, when a monk develops and cultivates the noble
eightfold path, for him the four foundations of mindfulness go to fulfilment by
development, the four right efforts go to fulfilment by development, the four
bases for success go to fulfilment by development, the five spiritual faculties
go to fulfilment by development, the five powers go to fulfilment by
development, the seven factors of enlightenment go to fulfilment by
development.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

by development only when the noble eightfold path is developed in the way
described above, namely based upon seclusion, dispassion and cessation,
maturing in release, <i>vivekanissita<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span> vir<span

</i>as the goal of endeavour. Then none of the preceding categories go astray.
They all contribute to the perfection and fulfilment of the noble eightfold
path. They are all enshrined in it. So well knitted and pervasive is the noble
eightfold path.</span></p>

importance, which illustrates the pervasive influence of the noble eightfold

</i>of the <i>Majjhima Nik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. There the
Buddha shows us how all the other enlightenment factors are included in the
noble eightfold path. In our discussion on <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>,<i>
</i>we happened to mention that the cessation of the six sense-spheres is <i>Nibb<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>. If <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>is
the cessation of the six sense-spheres, it should be possible to lay down a way
of practice leading to <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>through the
six sense-spheres themselves. As a matter of fact, there is such a way of
practice and this is what the <i>Mah<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>Sa<span

how the lack of knowledge of things as they are in regard to the six-fold
sense-sphere gives rise to attachments, entanglements and delusions. As a result
of it, the five aggregates of grasping get accumulated, leading to an increase
in craving that makes for re-becoming, as well as an increase in bodily
stresses and torment, mental stresses and torment, bodily fevers and mental
fevers, and bodily and mental suffering. </span></p>

This mirage nature of perception has to be understood. A deer which sees a
mirage in a plain from a distance in the dry season has a perception of water
in it. In other words, it imagines water in the mirage. Impelled by that
imagining, it runs towards the mirage with the idea that by running it can do
away with the gap between itself and the water, and reach that water. But there
is something that the deer is not aware of, and that is that this gap can never
be reduced by running. </span></p>

there is a middle. This is a maxim worth emphasizing. Where there are two ends,
there is a middle. If the eye is distinguished as one end and what appears in

between the two. All these three factors are integral in this perceptual
situation. That is why the gap can never be done away with. </span></p>

font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now let us try to understand this statement
in the light of what we have already said about the mirage. One can neither
approach nor retreat from a mirage. Generally, when one sees a mirage in the
dry season, one imagines a perception of water in it and runs towards it due to
thirst. But let us, for a moment, think that on seeing the mirage one becomes
apprehensive of a flood and turns and runs away to escape it. Having run some
far, if he looks back he will still see the mirage behind him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>So in the case of a mirage, the
more one approaches it, the farther it recedes, the more one recedes from it,
the nearer it appears. So in regard to the mirage of percepts, such as the seen
and the heard, the <i>arahant</i> neither approaches nor recedes. Mentally he
neither approaches nor recedes, though he may appear to do both physically,
from the point of view of the worldling - <i>anup<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yo
anap<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yo</i>, unattracted, unrepelled. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>It is the same with regard to the
term <i>anissito</i>, independent. He does not resort to the mirage with the
thought 'Ah, here is a good reservoir'<i>. Appa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7789;</span>ibaddho</i>,
uninvolved, he is not mentally involved in the mirage. <i>Vippamutto</i>,
released, he is released from the perception of water in the mirage, from
imagining water in it. <i>Visa<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>yutto, </i>unshackled,
he is not bound by it. <i>Vimariy<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>dikatena cetas<span

barriers? The two ends and the middle. The demarcation mentioned above by
distinguishing eye as distinct from form, with the intervening space or the gap
as the 'tertium quid'. So for the <i>arahant</i> there are no barriers by
taking the eye, the forms and the gap as discrete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

discussed, it should be clear that by <i>maÃ±Ã±an<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>

the cognized. One imagines a thing in the seen, heard etc. By that very
imagining as a thing it becomes another thing, true to the dictum expressed in
the line of that verse from the <i>Dvayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nupassan<span

&quot;dependent on the eye and forms, friends, arises eye-consciousness&quot;.
The deepest point in sense perception is already implicit there. This statement
clearly indicates that eye-consciousness is dependently arisen. Thereby we are
confronted with the question of the two ends and the middle, discussed above. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In fact, what is called
eye-consciousness is the very discrimination between eye and form. At whatever
moment the eye is distinguished as the internal sphere and form is
distinguished as the external sphere, it is then that eye-consciousness arises.
That itself is the gap in the middle, the intervening space. Here, then, we have
the two ends and the middle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>[1041]</span></span></a>
We mentioned that a carpenter, fixing up a door by joining two planks, might
speak of the contact between the two planks when his attention is turned to the
intervening space, to see how well one plank touches the other. The concept of
touching between the two planks came up because the carpenter's attention
picked up the two planks as separate and not as one board. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

eye-consciousness&quot;. In this perceptual situation, the eye is distinguished
from forms. That discrimination itself is consciousness. That is the gap or the
interstice, the middle. So here we have the two ends and the middle.</span></p>

view of <i>Dhamma</i>, is an extremely complex situation. As a matter of fact,
it is something that has two ends and a middle. The two ends and the middle
belong to it. However, there is a tendency in the world to ignore this middle.
The attempt to tie up the two ends by ignoring the middle is <i>up<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>or grasping. That
is impelled by craving, <i>ta<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7751;</span>h<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
Due to craving, grasping occurs as a matter of course. It is as if the deer,
thinking 'I am here and the water is there, so let me get closer', starts
running towards it. The gap is ignored. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>A similar thing happens in the case
of sense perception. What impels one to ignore that gap is craving. It is
sometimes called <i>lepa</i> or glue. With that agglutinative quality in
craving the gap is continually sought to be glued up and ignored. </span></p>

weaving, there is an attempt to reduce a gap by stitching up or knitting up.

end, according to him, is the arising of <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>.
The middle is the cessation of <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>. As
before, the seamstress is craving. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>When six explanations had come up
before the symposium, one monk suggested, somewhat like a point of order, that
since six different interpretations have come up, it would be best to approach
the teacher, the Fortunate One, and report the discussion for clarification and
correct judgement. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Approving that suggestion, they
all went to the Buddha and asked: <i>Kassa nu kho, bhante, subh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>sita<span lang=ZH-TW>&#7747;</span>? </i>&quot;Venerable
sir, whose words are well spoken?&quot; The Buddha replied: &quot;Monks, what
you all have said is well said from some point of view or other. But that for
which I preached that verse in the <i>MetteyyapaÃ±ha </i>is this&quot;, and
quoting the verse in question the Buddha explains: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>&quot;Monks, contact is one end,
the arising of contact is the second end, the cessation of contact is in the
middle, craving is the seamstress, for it is craving that puts the stitch for
the birth of this or that existence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>In so far, monks, does a monk
understand by higher knowledge what is to be understood by higher knowledge,
and comprehend by full understanding what is to be comprehended by full
understanding. Understanding by higher knowledge what is to be understood by
higher knowledge, and comprehending by full understanding what is to be
comprehended by full understanding, he becomes an ender of suffering in this
very life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The Buddha's explanation happens
to coincide with the interpretation given by the first speaker at the
symposium. However, since he ratifies all the six interpretations as well said,
we can see how profound and at the same time broad the meaning of this cryptic
verse is. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now try to understand these
six explanations. One can make use of these six as meditation topics. The verse
has a pragmatic value and so also the explanations given. What is the business
of this seamstress or weaver?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the first
interpretation, craving stitches up the first end, contact, with the second
end, the arising of contact, ignoring the middle, the cessation of contact. It
is beneath this middle, the cessation of contact, that ignorance lurks. As the
line <i>majjhe mant<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> na lippati</i>, &quot;with
wisdom does not get attached to the middle&quot;, implies, when what is in the
middle is understood, there is emancipation. One is released from craving. So
our special attention should be directed to what lies in the middle, the
cessation of contact. Therefore, according to the first interpretation, the
seamstress, craving, stitches up contact and the arising of contact, ignoring
the cessation of contact. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>According to the second
interpretation, the past and the future are stitched up, ignoring the present.
The third interpretation takes it as a stitching up of unpleasant feeling and
pleasant feeling, ignoring the neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling. The
fourth interpretation speaks of stitching up name and form, ignoring
consciousness. For the fifth interpretation, it is a case of stitching up the
six internal sense-spheres with the six external sense-spheres, ignoring
consciousness. In the sixth interpretation, we are told of a stitching up of <i>sakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, or 'existing-body', with the arising of the
existing-body, ignoring the cessation of the existing-body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>We mentioned above that in sewing
as well as in weaving there is an attempt to reduce a gap by stitching up or
knitting up. These interpretations show us that ignoring the middle is a common
trait in the worldling. It is there that ignorance lurks. If one rightly
understands this middle dispassion sets in, leading to disenchantment,
relinquishment and deliverance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now turn our attention to a
few parallel discourses that throw some light on the depth of these meditation
topics. We come across two verses in the <i>Dvayat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>nupassan<span

to is the cessation of consciousness, or the cessation of becoming. Such
emancipated ones are called &quot;dispellers of death&quot;, <i>maccuh<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yino</i>. We have mentioned earlier that, before the
advent of the Buddha and even afterwards, sages like <span lang=ZH-TW>&#256;&#7735;&#257;</span>ra
K<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>l<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ma tried to
escape form, <i>r<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>, by grasping the
formless, <i>ar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#363;</span>pa</i>. But only the Buddha could
point out that one cannot win release from form by resorting to the formless.
Release from both should be the aim. How could that come about? By the
cessation of consciousness which discriminates between form and formless. It is
tantamount to the cessation of existence, <i>bhavanirodha. </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>As a little hint to understand
this deep point, we may allude to that simile of the dog on the plank across
the stream which we brought up several times. Why does that dog keep on looking
at the dog it sees in the water, its own reflection? Because it is unaware of
the reflexive quality of the water. Consciousness is like that water which has
the quality of reflecting on its surface. What is there between the <u>seen</u>
dog and the <u>looking</u> dog as the middle is consciousness itself. One can
therefore understand why consciousness is said to be in the middle between name
and form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Generally, in the traditional analysis
of the relation between name-and-form and consciousness, this fact is
overlooked. True to the simile of the magical illusion, given to consciousness,
its middle position between name and form is difficult for one to understand.
Had the dog understood the reflective quality of water, it would not halt on
that plank to gaze down and growl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

six internal sense-spheres and the six external sense-spheres on either side,

dyad consciousness arises&quot;, says the Buddha. That is to say, dependent on
internal and external sense-spheres consciousness arises. As we have already
pointed out, consciousness is the very discrimination between the two.
Therefore consciousness is the middle. So at the moment when one understands
consciousness, one realizes that the fault lies in this discrimination itself.
The farther limit of the internal is the nearer limit of the external. One
understands then that the gap, the interstice between them, is something
imagined. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Then as to the sixth
interpretation, we have the <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, the
&quot;existing body&quot;, and <i>sakk<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>yasamudaya</i>,
the arising of the existing body, as the two ends. Because the term <i>sakk<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya </i>is not often met with, it might be difficult to
understand what it means. To be brief, the Buddha has defined the term as
referring to the five aggregates of grasping.<a name="_ednref1049"></a><a
href="#_edn1049" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>[1049]</span></span></a> Its derivation, <i>sat k<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ya</i>, indicates that the term is suggestive of the
tendency to take the whole group as existing, giving way to the perception of
the compact, <i>ghanasaÃ±Ã±<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>The arising of this notion of an
existing body is <i>chandar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>ga</i> or desire and
lust. It is due to desire or craving that one grasps a heap as a compact whole.
The cessation of the existing body is the abandonment of desire and lust. This,
then, is a summary of the salient points in these six interpretations as
meditation topics for realization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Let us now turn our attention to
the sewing and weaving spoken of here. We have mentioned above that both in
sewing and weaving a knotting comes in, as a way of reducing the gap. This
knotting involves some kind of attracting, binding and entangling. In the case
of a sewing machine, every time the needle goes down, the shuttle hastens to
put a knot for the stitch. So long as this attraction continues, the stitching
goes on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>There is some relation between
sewing and weaving. Sewing is an attempt to put together two folds. In weaving
a single thread of cotton or wool is looped into two folds. In both there is a
formation of knots. As already mentioned, knots are formed by some sort of
attraction, binding and entangling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>Now craving is the seamstress who
puts the stitches to this existence, <i>bhava</i>. She has a long line of
qualifications for it. <i>Ponobhavik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> nandir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gasahagat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span> tatratatr<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhinandin<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299; </span></i>are some of
the epithets for craving. She is the perpetrator in re-becoming or renewed
existence, <i>ponobhavik<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, bringing about
birth after birth. She has a trait of delighting and lusting, <i>nandir<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>gasahagat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>.
Notoriously licentious she delights now here now there,<i> tatratatr<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>bhinandin<span lang=ZH-TW>&#299;</span>. </i>Like that
seamstress, craving puts the stitches into existence, even as the needle and
the shuttle. Craving draws in with <i>up<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>d<span
lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>, grasping, while conceit binds and views
complete the entanglement. That is how existence gets stitched up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.2pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Arial Unicode MS","sans-serif"'>At whatever moment the shuttle
runs out of its load of cotton, the apparent stitches do not result in a seam.
Similarly, in a weaving, if instead of drawing in the thread to complete the
knot it is drawn out, all what is woven will be undone immediately. This is the
difference between existence and its cessation. Existence is a formation of
knots and stress. Cessation is an unravelling of knots and rest. </span></p>

entire series of thirty-three sermons. All what we brought up in these sermons
concerns the question of the two ends and the middle. The episode of the two
ends and the middle enshrines a profound insight into the law of dependent
arising and the Buddha's teachings on the middle path. That is why we said that
the verse in question is both profound and broad, as far as its meaning is
concerned.</span></p>

synoptic verse, we propose to wind up this series of sermons. As a matter of
fact, the reason for many a misconception about <i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na</i>
is a lack of understanding the law of dependent arising and the middle path.
For the same reason, true to the Buddha's description of beings as taking
delight in existence, <i>bhavar<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>m<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>,
lusting for existence, <i>bhavarat<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span></i>, and

<i>Nibb<span lang=ZH-TW>&#257;</span>na </i>came to be apprehensively
misconstrued as tantamount to annihilation. Therefore even commentators were scared
of the prospect of a cessation of existence and tried to explain away <i>Nibb<span

craving for existence. </span></p>
