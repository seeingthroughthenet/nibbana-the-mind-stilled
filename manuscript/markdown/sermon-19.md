With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the nineteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.

Towards the end of our last sermon, we started commenting on the two terms
*sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu* and *anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu*. Our discussion was
based on a discourse, which we quoted from the *Itivuttaka*. We also drew
attention to a certain analogy found in the discourses, which shows that the two
Nibbāna elements actually represent two stages of the extinguishment implicit in
the term Nibbāna.

When no more firewood is added to a blazing fire, flames would subside and the
logs of wood already burning go on smouldering as embers. After some time, they
too get extinguished and become ashes. With regard to the *arahant*, too, we
have to think in terms of this analogy.

It can be taken as an illustration of the two Nibbāna elements. To the extent
the living *arahant* is free from fresh graspings, lust, hate and delusions do
not flare up. But so long as he has to bear the burden of this organic
combination, this physical frame, the *arahant* has to experience certain
afflictions and be receptive to likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains.

In spite of all that, mentally he has access to the experience of the
extinguishment he has already won. It is in that sense that the *arahant* is
said to be in the Nibbāna element with residual clinging in his everyday life,
while taking in the objects of the five senses.

At the last moment of the *arahant's* life, even this organic body that had been
grasped as *upādiṇṇa* has to be abandoned. It is at that moment, when he is
going to detach his mind from the body, that *anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu*
comes in. A brief hint to this effect is given in one of the verses occurring in
the *Nāgasutta* referred to earlier. The verse runs thus:

> *Vītarāga vītadoso* \
> *vītamoho anāsavo* \
> *sarīraṁ vijahaṁ nāgo* \
> *parinibbissati anāsavo.*[^fn638]
>
> The one who has abandoned lust, \
> Hate and delusion and is influx-free, \
> That elephant of a man, on giving up his body, \
> Will attain full appeasement, being influx-free.

If we define in brief the two Nibbāna elements this way, a more difficult
problem confronts us relating to the sense in which they are called
*diṭṭhadhammika* and *samparāyika*. *Diṭṭhadhammika* means what pertains to this
life and *samparāyika* refers to what comes after death. What is the idea in
designating *sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu* as *diṭṭhadhammika* and *anupādisesā
Nibbānadhātu* as *samparāyika*?

In the context of *kamma*, the meaning of these two terms is easily understood.
But when it comes to Nibbāna, such an application of the terms would imply two
types of *Nibbānic* bliss, one to be experienced here and the other hereafter.

But that kind of explanation would not accord with the spirit of this Dhamma,
because the Buddha always emphasizes the fact that Nibbāna is something to be
realized here and now in toto. It is not a piecemeal realization, leaving
something for the hereafter. Such terms like *diṭṭheva dhamme*, in this very
life, *sandiṭṭhika*, here and now, and *akālika*, timeless, emphasize this
aspect of Nibbāna.

In the context of Nibbāna, these two terms have to be understood as representing
two aspects of a perfect realization attainable in this very life. Briefly
stated, *anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu* is that which confers the certitude, well in
time, that the appeasement experienced by an *arahant* during this life time
remains unchanged even at death.

To say that there is a possibility of realizing or ascertaining one's state
after death might even seem contradictory. How can one realize one's after death
state?

We get a clear-cut answer to that question in the following passage in the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* of the *Majjhima Nikāya*.

> *Seyyathāpi, bhikkhu, telañca paṭicca vaṭṭiñca paṭicca telappadīpo jhāyati,
> tasseva telassa ca vaṭṭiyā ca pariyādānā aññassa ca anupahārā anāhāro
> nibbāyati, evameva kho, bhikkhu, kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno
> 'kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vedayāmī'ti pajānati, jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ
> vediyamāno 'jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vedayāmī'ti pajānati, 'kāyassa bhedā
> paraṁ maraṇā uddhaṁ jīvitapariyādānā idheva sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni
> sītībhavissantī'ti pajānati.*[^fn639]
>
> Just as, monk, an oil lamp burns depending on oil and the wick, and when that
> oil and the wick are used up, if it does not get any more of these, it is
> extinguished from lack of fuel, even so, monk, when he feels a feeling limited
> to the body, he understands 'I feel a feeling limited to the body', when he
> feels a feeling limited to life, he understands 'I feel a feeling limited to
> life', he understands 'on the breaking up of this body, before life becomes
> extinct, even here itself, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will
> become cool'.

The last sentence is particularly noteworthy in that it refers to an
understanding well beforehand that all feelings, not being delighted in, will
become cool at death. The futuristic ending signifies an assurance, here and
now, as the word *idheva*, even here itself, clearly brings out. The delighting
will not be there, because all craving for a fresh existence is extirpated.

The *arahant* has won this assurance already in his *arahattaphalasamādhi*, in
which he experiences the cooling off of all feelings. That is why we find the
*arahants* giving expression to their *Nibbānic* bliss in the words
*sītibhūto'smi nibbuto*, "gone cool am I, yea, extinguished".[^fn640]

Since for the *arahant* this cooling off of feelings is a matter of experience
in this very life, this realization is referred to as *anupādā parinibbāna* in
the discourses. Here we seem to have fallen into another track. We opened our
discussion with an explanation of what *anupādisesa parinibbāna* is, now we are
on *anupādā parinibbāna*. How are we to distinguish between these two?

*Anupādisesa parinibbāna* comes at the last moment of the *arahant's* life, when
this organic combination of elements, grasped par excellence, *upādiṇṇa*, is
discarded for good. But *anupādā parinibbāna* refers to the
*arahattaphalasamādhi* as such, for which even other terms like *anupādā
vimokkha* are also applied on occasion.[^fn641]

As the term *anupādā parinibbāna* signifies, the *arahant* experiences, even in
this very life, that complete extinguishment, *parinibbāna*, in his *arahatta
phalasamādhi*. This fact is clearly brought out in the dialogue between
Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta in the *Rathavinītasutta*
of the *Majjhima Nikāya*.

Venerable Sāriputta's exhaustive interrogation ending with

> *kim atthaṁ carahāvuso, bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati?*[^fn642]
>
> For the sake of what then, friend, is the holy life lived under the Exalted
> One?

gets the following conclusive answer from Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta:

> *anupādāparinibbānatthaṁ kho, āvuso, bhagavati brahmacariyaṁ vussati*,
>
> Friend, it is for the sake of perfect Nibbāna without grasping that the holy
> life is lived under the Exalted One.

As the goal of endeavour, *anupādā parinibbāna* surely does not mean the ending
of life. What it implies is the realization of Nibbāna. It is that experience of
the cooling off of feelings the *arahant* goes through in the
*arahattaphalasamādhi*.

It is sometimes also called *nirupadhi*, the 'asset-less'.[^fn643] Here we have
a problem of a semantic type. At a later date, even the term *nirupadhisesa*
seems to have come into vogue, which is probably a cognate formed after the term
*anupādisesa*.[^fn644]

Nowhere in the discourses one comes across the term *nirupadhisesa parinibbāna*.
Only such terms as *nirupadhi*, *nirūpadhiṁ,* *nirupadhi dhammaṁ* are met with.
They all refer to that *arahattaphalasamādhi*, as for instance in the following
verse, which we had occasion to quote earlier too:

> *Kāyena amataṁ dhātuṁ,* \
> *phusayitvā nirūpadhiṁ,* \
> *upadhipaṭinissaggaṁ,* \
> *sacchikatvā anāsavo,* \
> *deseti sammāsambuddho,* \
> *asokaṁ virajaṁ padaṁ.*[^fn645]
>
> Having touched with the body, \
> The deathless element, which is asset-less, \
> And realized the relinquishment of assets, \
> Being influx-free, the perfectly enlightened one, \
> Proclaims the sorrow-less, taintless state.

To proclaim, one has to be alive. Therefore *nirupadhi* is used in the
discourses definitely for the *arahattaphalasamādhi*, which is a living
experience for the *arahant*.

*Anupādā parinibbāna, anupādā vimokkha* and *nirupadhi* all refer to that
experience of the cooling off of feelings. This fact is clearly revealed by the
following two verses in the *Vedanāsaṁyutta* of the *Saṁyutta Nikāya*:

> *Samāhito sampajāno,* \
> *sato Buddhassa sāvako,* \
> *vedanā ca pajānāti,* \
> *vedanānañca sambhavaṁ.*
>
> *Yattha cetā nirujjhanti,* \
> *maggañca khayagāminaṁ,* \
> *vedanānaṁ khayā bhikkhu,* \
> *nicchāto parinibbuto.*[^fn646]

In this couplet, the experience of the fruit of *arahanthood* is presented under
the heading of feeling. The disciple of the Buddha, concentrated, fully aware
and mindful, understands feelings, the origin of feelings, and the point at
which they surcease and the way leading to their extinction.

With the extinction of feelings, that monk is hunger-less and perfectly
extinguished. The reference here is to that bliss of Nibbāna which is devoid of
feeling, *avedayita sukha*.[^fn647] It is hunger-less because it is free from
craving.

The perfect extinguishment mentioned here is not to be understood as the death
of the *arahant*. In the discourses the term *parinibbuta* is used as such even
with reference to the living *arahant*. Only in the commentaries we find a
distinction made in this respect. The *parinibbāna* of the living *arahant* is
called *kilesaparinibbāna*, the perfect extinguishment of the defilements, while
what comes at the last moment of an *arahant's* life is called
*khandhaparinibbāna*, the perfect extinguishment of the groups or
aggregates.[^fn648] Such a qualification, however, is not found in the
discourses.

The reason for this distinction was probably the semantic development the term
*parinibbāna* had undergone in the course of time. The fact that this perfect
extinguishment is essentially psychological seems to have been ignored with the
passage of time. That is why today, on hearing the word *parinibbāna*, one is
immediately reminded of the last moment of the life of the Buddha or of an
*arahant*. In the discourses, however, *parinibbāna* is clearly an experience of
the living *arahant* in his *arahattaphalasamādhi*.

This fact is clearly borne out by the statement in the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta*
already quoted:

> *idheva sabbavedayitāni anabhinanditāni sītībhavissantī'ti pajānati*,[^fn649]
>
> he understands that all what is felt will cool off here itself.

It is this very understanding that is essential. It gives the certitude that one
can defeat Māra at the moment of death through the experience of the cooling off
of feelings.

The phrase *jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ* refers to the feeling which comes at the
termination of one's life. For the *arahant*, the *arahattaphalasamādhi* stands
in good stead, particularly at the moment of death. That is why it is called
*akuppā cetovimutti*, the unshakeable deliverance of the mind.

All other deliverances of the mind get shaken before the pain of death, but not
this unshakeable deliverance of the mind, which is the REAL-ization of
extinguishment that is available to the *arahant* already in the
*arahattaphalasamādhi*, in the experience of the cooling off of feelings. It is
this unshakeable deliverance of the mind that the Buddha and the *arahants*
resort to at the end of their lives, when Māra comes to grab and seize.

So now we can hark back to that verse which comes as the grand finale in the
long discourse from the *Itivuttaka* we have already quoted.

> *Ye etad aññāya padaṁ asaṅkhataṁ,* \
> *vimuttacittā bhavanettisaṅkhayā,* \
> *te dhammasārādhigamā khaye ratā,* \
> *pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino.*[^fn650]

This verse might appear problematic, as it occurs at the end of a passage
dealing with the two Nibbāna elements.

> *Ye etad aññāya padaṁ asaṅkhataṁ*,
>
> those who having fully comprehended this unprepared state,
>
> *vimuttacittā bhavanettisaṅkhayā*,
>
> are released in mind by the cutting off of tentacles to becoming,
>
> *te dhammasārādhigamā khaye ratā*,
>
> taking delight in the extirpation of feelings due to their attainment to the
> essence of *dhamma*,
>
> (that is the unshakeable deliverance of the mind),
>
> *pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino*,
>
> being steadfastly such like, they have given up all forms of becoming.

The last line is an allusion to the experience of the cessation of existence
here and now, which in effect is the realization of Nibbāna, true to the
definition *bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ*, "cessation of existence is Nibbāna".[^fn651]

It is that very cessation of existence that is called *asaṅkhata dhātu*, the
'unprepared element'. If *bhava*, or existence, is to be called *saṅkhata*, the
'prepared', the cessation of existence has to be designated as *asaṅkhata*, the
'unprepared'. Here lies the difference between the two.

So we have here two aspects of the same unprepared element, designated as
*sa-upādisesā parinibbānadhātu* and *anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu*. The mind is
free even at the stage of *sa-upādisesa*, to the extent that the smouldering
embers do not seek fresh fuel.

*Anupādisesa* refers to the final experience of extinguishment. There the
relevance of the term *parinibbāna* lies in the fact that at the moment of death
the *arahants* direct their minds to this unshakeable deliverance of the mind.
This is the 'island' they resort to when Māra comes to grab.

The best illustration for all this is the way the Buddha faced death, when the
time came for it. Venerable Anuruddha delineates it beautifully in the following
two verses:

> *Nāhu assāsapassāso,* \
> *ṭhitacittassa tādino,* \
> *anejo santimārabbha,* \
> *yaṁ kālamakarī muni.*
> 
> *Asallīnena cittena,* \
> *vedanaṁ ajjhavāsayi,* \
> *pajjotass'eva nibbānaṁ,* \
> *vimokkho cetaso ahu.*[^fn652]
> 
> Adverting to whatever peace, \
> The urgeless sage reached the end of his life span, \
> There were no in-breaths and out-breaths, \
> For that steadfastly such-like one of firm mind.
> 
> With a mind fully alert, \
> He bore up the pain, \
> The deliverance of the mind was like \
> The extinguishment of a torch.

The allusion here is to the deliverance of the mind. This is a description of
how the Buddha attained *parinibbāna*. Though there is a great depth in these
two verses, the commentarial exegesis seems to have gone at a tangent at this
point. Commenting on the last two lines of the first verse, the commentary
observes: *Buddhamuni santiṁ gamissāmīti, santiṁ ārabbha kālamakari*, "the
Buddha, the sage, passed away for the sake of that peace with the idea 'I will
go to that state of peace'".[^fn653]

There is some discrepancy in this explanation. Commentators themselves usually
give quite a different sense to the word *ārabbha* than the one implicit in this
explanation. Here it means "for the sake of". It is for the sake of that peace
that the Buddha is said to have passed away.

In such commentaries as *Jātaka-aṭṭhakathā* and *Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā*,
commentators do not use the word *ārabbha* in the introductory episodes in this
sense. There it only means "in connection with", indicating the origin of the
story, as suggested by the etymological background of the word itself.

When for instance it is said that the Buddha preached a particular sermon in
connection with Devadatta Thera, it does not necessarily mean that it was meant
for him.[^fn654] He may not have been there at all, it may be that he was
already dead by that time. The term *ārabbha* in such contexts only means that
it was in connection with him. It can refer to a person or an incident, as the
point of origin of a particular sermon.

Granted this, we have to explain the verse in question not as an allusion to the
fact that the Buddha, the sage, passed away for the sake of that peace with the
idea 'I will attain to that state of peace'. It only means that the Buddha, the
sage, passed away having brought his mind into that state of peace. In other
words, according to the commentary the passing away comes first and the peace
later, but according to the sutta proper, peace comes first and the passing away
later.

There is a crucial point involved in this commentarial divergence. It has the
presumption that the Buddha passed away in order to enter into 'that Nibbāna
element'. This presumption is evident quite often in the commentaries. When hard
put to it, the commentaries sometimes concede the sutta's standpoint, but more
often than otherwise they follow a line of interpretation that comes dangerously
close to an eternalist point of view, regarding Nibbāna.

Here too the commentarial exegesis, based on the term *ārabbha*, runs the same
risk. On the other hand, as we have pointed out, the reference here is to the
fact that the Buddha adverted his mind to that peace well before the onset of
death, whereby Māra's attempt is foiled, because feelings are already cooled
off. It is here that the unshakeable deliverance of the mind proves its worth.

As a 'real'-ization it is already available to the Buddha and the *arahants* in
the *arahattaphalasamādhi*, and when the time comes, they put forward this
experience to beat off Māra. That is why we find a string of epithets for
Nibbāna, such as *tāṇaṁ, leṇaṁ, dīpaṁ, saraṇaṁ, parāyanaṁ, khemaṁ* and
*amataṁ*.[^fn655]

When faced with death, or the pain of death, it gives 'protection'*, tānaṁ*.

It provides shelter, like a 'cave', *leṇaṁ*.

It is the 'island', *dīpaṁ*, within easy reach.

It is the 'refuge', *saraṇaṁ*, and the 'resort', *parāyanaṁ*.

It is the 'security', *khemaṁ*, and above all the 'deathless', *amataṁ*.

This deathlessness they experience in this very world, and when death comes,
this realization stands them in good stead.

Why Venerable Anuruddha brought in the profane concept of death with the
expression *kālamakari* into this verse, describing the Buddha's *parinibbāna*,
is also a question that should arrest our attention.

This particular expression is generally used in connection with the death of
ordinary people. Why did he use this expression in such a hallowed context? It
is only to distinguish and demarcate the deliverance of the mind, couched in the
phrase *vimokkho cetaso ahu*, from the phenomenon of death itself.

The Buddhas and *arahants* also abandon this body, like other beings. The
expression *kālamakari*, "made an end of time", is an allusion to this
phenomenon. In fact, it is only the Buddhas and *arahants* who truly make an
'end' of time, being fully aware of it. Therefore the most important revelation
made in the last two lines of the first verse, *anejo santimārabbha, yaṁ
kālamakarī muni*, is the fact that the Buddha passed away having brought his
mind to the peace of Nibbāna.

All this goes to prove that an *arahant*, even here and now in this very life,
has realized his after death state, which is none other than the birthless
cessation of all forms of existence that amounts to deathlessness itself.

In all other religions immortality is something attainable after death. If one
brings down the Buddha's Dhamma also to that level, by smuggling in the idea of
an everlasting Nibbāna, it too will suffer the same fate. That would contradict
the teachings on impermanence, *aniccatā*, and insubstantiality, *anattatā*.

But here we have an entirely different concept. It is a case of overcoming the
critical situation of death by directing one's mind to a concentration that
nullifies the power of Māra. So it becomes clear that the two terms
*sa-upādisesā parinibbānadhātu* and *anupādisesā parinibbānadhātu* stand for two
aspects of the same *asaṅkhatadhātu*, or the unprepared element.

As a matter of fact, *arahants* have already directly realized, well in time,
their after death state. That is to say, not only have they gone through the
experience of extinguishment here and now, but they are also assured of the fact
that this extinguishment is irreversible even after death, since all forms of
existence come to cease.

This is an innovation, the importance of which can hardly be overestimated. Here
the Buddha has transcended even the dichotomy between the two terms
*sandiṭṭhika* and *samparāyika*. Generally, the world is inclined to believe
that one can be assured only of things pertaining to this life. In fact, the
word *sandiṭṭhika* literally means that one can be sure only of things visible
here and now. Since one cannot be sure of what comes after death, worldlings are
in the habit of investing faith in a particular teacher or in a god.

To give a clearer picture of the principle involved in this statement, let us
bring up a simple episode, concerning the general Sīha, included among the Fives
of the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*. It happens to centre on *dānakathā*, or talks on
liberality. Let it be a soft interlude – after all these abstruse discourses.

Sīha, the general, is a wealthy benefactor, endowed with deep faith in the
Buddha. One day he approaches the Buddha and asks the question:

> *sakkā nu kho, bhante, sandiṭṭhikaṁ dānaphalaṁ paññāpetuṁ?*[^fn656]
>
> Is it possible, Lord, to point out an advantage or fruit of giving visible
> here and now?

What prompted the question may have been the usual tendency to associate the
benefits of giving with the hereafter. Now the Buddha, in his answer to the
question, gave four advantages visible here and now and one advantage to come
hereafter. The four fruits of giving visible here and now are stated as follows:

1. *dāyako, sīha, dānapati bahuno janassa piyo hoti manāpo*, "Sīha, a benevolent
   donor is dear and acceptable to many people".
2. *dāyakaṁ dānapatiṁ santo sappurisā bhajanti*, "good men of integrity resort
   to that benevolent donor".
3. *dāyakassa dānapatino kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggacchati*, "a good report of
   fame goes in favour of that benevolent donor".
4. *dāyako dānapati yaṁ yadeva parisaṁ upasaṅkamati, yadi khattiyaparisaṁ yadi
   brāhmaṇaparisaṁ yadi gahapatiparisaṁ yadi samaṇaparisaṁ, visārado va
   upasaṅkamati amaṅkubhūto*, "whatever assembly that benevolent donor
   approaches, be it an assembly of kings, or brahmins, or householders, or
   recluses, he approaches with self confidence, not crestfallen".

These four fruits or advantages are reckoned as *sandiṭṭhika*, because one can
experience them here and now. In addition to these, the Buddha mentions a fifth,
probably by way of encouragement, though it is outside the scope of the
question.

5. *dāyako, sīha, dānapati kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā sugatiṁ saggaṁ lokaṁ
   upapajjati*, "the benevolent donor, Sīha, when his body breaks up after death
   is reborn in a happy heavenly world."

This is a fruit of giving that pertains to the next world, *samparāyikaṁ
dānaphalaṁ*. Then Sīha the general makes a comment, which is directly relevant
to our discussion:

> *Yānimāni, bhante, bhagavatā cattāri sandiṭṭhikāni dānaphalāni akkhātāni,
> nāhaṁ ettha bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi, ahaṁ petāni jānāmi. Yañca kho maṁ,
> bhante, bhagavā evamāha 'dāyako, sīha, dānapati kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā
> sugatiṁ saggaṁ lokaṁ upapajjatī'ti, etāhaṁ na jānāmi, ettha ca panāhaṁ
> bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi*.
>
> Those four fruits of giving, visible here and now, which the Lord has
> preached, as for them, I do not believe out of faith in the Exalted One,
> because I myself know them to be so. But that about which the Exalted One
> said: 'Sīha, a benevolent donor, when the body breaks up after death is reborn
> in a happy heavenly world', this I do not know. As to that, however, I believe
> out of faith in the Exalted One.

Regarding the first four advantages of giving, Sīha says "I do not believe out
of faith in the Exalted One, because I myself know them to be so", *nāhaṁ ettha
bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi, ahaṁ petāni jānāmi*. It is because he knows out of
his own experience that they are facts that he does not believe out of faith in
the Exalted One. There is something deep, worth reflecting upon, in this
statement.

Then with regard to the fruit of giving, mentioned last, that is to say the one
that concerns the hereafter, *samparāyika*, Sīha confesses that he does not know
it as a fact, but that he believes it out of faith in the Exalted One, *etāhaṁ
na jānāmi, ettha ca panāhaṁ bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi*. It is because he does
not know, that he believes out of faith in the Exalted One.

Here then we have a good illustration of the first principle we have outlined
earlier. Where there is knowledge born of personal experience, there is no need
of faith. Faith is displaced by knowledge of realization. It is where one has no
such experiential knowledge that faith comes in. That is why Sīha confesses that
he has faith in the fifth fruit of giving. With regard to the first four, faith
is something redundant for him.

Now that we have clarified for ourselves this first principle, there is a
certain interesting riddle verse in the *Dhammapada*, to which we may apply it
effectively, not out of a flair for riddles, but because it is relevant to our
topic.

> *Assaddho akataññū ca,* \
> *sandhicchedo ca yo naro,* \
> *hatāvakāso vantāso,* \
> *sa ve uttamaporiso.*[^fn657]

This is a verse attributed to the Buddha that comes in the *Arahantavagga* of
the *Dhammapada*, which puns upon some words. Such riddle verses follow the
pattern of a figure of speech called double entendre, which makes use of
ambiguous words. The above verse sounds blasphemous on the first hearing. The
Buddha is said to have employed this device to arrest the listener's attention.
The surface meaning seems to go against the Dhamma, but it provokes deeper
reflection.

For instance, *assaddho* means faithless, to be *akataññū* is to be ungrateful,
*sandhicchedo* is a term for a housebreaker, *hatāvakāso* is a hopeless case
with no opportunities, *vantāso* means greedy of vomit. So the surface meaning
amounts to this:

> That faithless ungrateful man, \
> Who is a housebreaker, \
> Who is hopeless and greedy of vomit, \
> He indeed is the man supreme.

For the deeper meaning the words have to be construed differently. *Assaddho*
implies that level of penetration into truth at which faith becomes redundant.
*Akata*, the unmade, is an epithet for Nibbāna, and *akataññū* is one who knows
the unmade. *Sandhicchedo* means one who has cut off the connecting links to
*saṁsāra*. *Hatāvakāso* refers to that elimination of opportunities for rebirth.
*Vantāso* is a term for one who has vomited out desires. The true meaning of the
verse, therefore, can be summed up as follows:

> That man who has outgrown faith, \
> <span class="vin"></span> as he is a knower of the unmade, \
> Who has sundered all shackles to existence \
> <span class="vin"></span> and destroyed all possibilities of rebirth, \
> Who has spewed out all desires, \
> He indeed is the man supreme.

The description, then, turns out to be that of an *arahant*. *Assaddho* as an
epithet for the *arahant* follows the same norm as the epithet *asekho*.
*Sekha*, meaning 'learner', is a term applied to those who are training for the
attainment of *arahanthood*, from the stream-winner, *sotāpanna*, upwards.

Literally, *asekha* could be rendered as 'unlearned' or 'untrained'. But it is
certainly not in that sense that an *arahant* is called *asekha*. He is called
*asekha* in the sense that he is no longer in need of that training, that is to
say, he is an adept. *Assaddho*, too, has to be construed similarly.

As we have mentioned before, the *arahant* has already realized the cessation of
existence in his *arahattaphalasamādhi*, thereby securing the knowledge of the
unmade, *akata*, or the unprepared, *asaṅkhata*. The term *akataññū* highlights
that fact of realization.

The most extraordinary and marvellous thing about the realization of Nibbāna is
that it gives an assurance not only of matters pertaining to this life,
*sandiṭṭhika*, but also of what happens after death, *samparāyika* – in other
words, the realization of the cessation of existence.

Nibbāna as the realization here and now of the cessation of existence,
*bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ*, carries with it the assurance that there is no more
existence after death. So there is only one *asaṅkhatadhātu*. The verse we
already quoted, too, ends with the words *pahaṁsu te sabbabhavāni tādino*,
"those steadfastly such like ones have given up all forms of existence".[^fn658]

One thing should be clear now. Though there are two Nibbāna elements called
*sa-upādisesā Nibbānadhātu* and *anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu*, there is no
justification whatsoever for taking *anupādisesā Nibbānadhātu* as a place of
eternal rest for the *arahants* after death – an everlasting immortal state.

The deathlessness of Nibbāna is to be experienced in this world itself. That is
why an *arahant* is said to feast on ambrosial deathlessness, *amataṁ
paribhuñjati*, when he is in *arahattaphalasamādhi*. When it is time for death,
he brings his mind to this *samādhi*, and it is while he is partaking of
ambrosial deathlessness that Māra quietly takes away his body.

An *arahant* might even cremate his own body, as if it is another's.

Now we are at an extremely deep point in this Dhamma. We have to say something
in particular about the two terms *saṅkhata* and *asaṅkhata*. In our last
sermon, we happened to give a rather unusual explanation of such pair-wise terms
like the 'hither shore' and the 'farther shore', as well as the 'mundane' and
the 'supramundane'.

The two terms in each pair are generally believed to be far apart and the gap
between them is conceived in terms of time and space. But we compared this gap
to that between the lotus leaf and the drop of water on it, availing ourselves
of a simile offered by the Buddha himself.

The distance between the lotus leaf and the drop of water on it is the same as
that between the hither shore and the farther shore, between the mundane and the
supramundane. This is no idle sophistry, but a challenge to deeper reflection.

The *Dhammapada* verse we quoted earlier beginning with *yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,
pārāpāraṁ na vijjati*,[^fn659] "to whom there is neither a farther shore nor a
hither shore nor both", is puzzling enough. But what it says is that the
*arahant* has transcended both the hither shore and the farther shore. It is as
if he has gone beyond this shore and the other shore as well, that is to say, he
has transcended the dichotomy.

We have to say something similar with regard to the two terms *saṅkhata* and
*asaṅkhata*. *Saṅkhata*, or the prepared, is like a floral design. This prepared
floral design, which is *bhava*, or existence, is made up, as it were, with the
help of the glue of craving, the tangles of views and the knots of conceits.

If one removes the glue, disentangles the tangles and unties the knots, the
*saṅkhata*, or the prepared, itself becomes *asaṅkhata*, the unprepared, then
and there. The same floral design, which was the *saṅkhata*, has now become the
*asaṅkhata*. This itself is the cessation of existence, *bhavanirodho*. When one
can persuade oneself to think of Nibbāna as an extinguishment, the term
*parinibbāna* can well be understood as 'perfect extinguishment'.

The *parinibbāna* of the *arahant* Dabba Mallaputta is recorded in the *Udāna*
as a special occasion on which the Buddha uttered a paean of joy. Venerable
Dabba Mallaputta was an *arahant*, gifted with marvellous psychic powers,
specializing in miracles performed by mastering the fire element, *tejo dhātu*.
His *parinibbāna*, too, was a marvel in itself.

When he found himself at the end of his life span, he approached the Buddha and
informed him of it, as if begging permission, with the words:

> *parinibbāna kālo me dāni, sugata*,[^fn660]
>
> it is time for me to attain *parinibbāna*, O well-gone one.

And the Buddha too gave permission with the words:

> *yassa dāni tvaṁ, Dabba, kālaṁ maññasi*,
>
> Dabba, you may do that for which the time is fit.

As soon as the Buddha uttered these words, Venerable Dabba Mallaputta rose from
his seat, worshipped the Buddha, circumambulated him, went up into the sky and,
sitting cross-legged, aroused the concentration of the fire element and, rising
from it, attained *parinibbāna*. As his body thus miraculously self-cremated
burnt in the sky, it left no ashes or soot.

This was something significant that fits in with the definition of Nibbāna so
far given. That is probably why the Buddha is said to have uttered a special
verse of uplift or paean of joy at this extinguishment, which was perfect in
every sense.

> *Abhedi kāyo, nirodhi saññā,* \
> *vedanā sītirahaṁsu sabbā,* \
> *vūpasamiṁsu saṅkhārā,* \
> *viññānaṁ attham agamā.*
>
> Body broke up, perceptions ceased, \
> All feelings cooled off, \
> Preparations calmed down, \
> Consciousness came to an end.

This event was of such a great importance that, though it occurred at Veḷuvana
Ārāma in Rājagaha, the Buddha related the event to the congregation of monks
when he returned to Sāvatthī.

It was not an incidental mention in reply to a particular question, but a
special peroration recounting the event and commemorating it with the following
two *Udāna* verses, which so aptly constitute the grand finale to our *Udāna*
text.

> *Ayoghanahatass'eva,* \
> *jalato jātavedaso,* \
> *anupubbūpasantassa,* \
> *yathā na ñāyate gati.*
>
> *Evaṁ sammāvimuttānaṁ,* \
> *kāmabandhoghatārinaṁ,* \
> *paññāpetuṁ gatī natthi,* \
> *pattānaṁ acalaṁ sukhaṁ.*[^fn661]
>
> Just as in the case of a fire \
> Blazing like a block of iron in point of compactness, \
> When it gradually calms down, \
> No path it goes by can be traced.
>
> Even so of those who are well released, \
> Who have crossed over the floods of shackles of sensuality, \
> And reached Bliss Unshaken, \
> There is no path to be pointed out.

We have deviated from the commentarial interpretation in our rendering of the
first two lines of the verse. The commentary gives two alternative meanings,
probably because it is in doubt as to the correct one. Firstly it brings in the
idea of a bronze vessel that is being beaten at the forge with an iron hammer,
giving the option that the gradual subsidence mentioned in the verse may apply
either to the flames or to the reverberations of sound arising out of
it.[^fn662] Secondly, as a 'some say so' view, *kecidvāda*, it gives an
alternative meaning, connected with the ball of iron beaten at the forge.

In our rendering, however, we had to follow a completely different line of
interpretation, taking the expression *ayoghanahatassa* as a comparison,
*ayoghanahatassa + iva*, for the blazing fire, *jalato jātavedaso*. On seeing a
fire that is ablaze, one gets a notion of compactness, as on seeing a red hot
block of solid iron.

In the *Dhammapada* verse beginning with *seyyo ayogulo bhutto, tatto
aggisikhūpamo*,[^fn663] "better to swallow a red hot iron ball, that resembles a
flame of fire", a cognate simile is employed somewhat differently. There the
ball of iron is compared to a flame of fire. Here the flame of fire is compared
to a block of iron.

All in all, it is highly significant that the Buddha uttered three verses of
uplift in connection with the *parinibbāna* of the *arahant* Venerable Dabba
Mallaputta. The most important point that emerges from this discussion is that
Nibbāna is essentially an extinction or extinguishment.

An extinguished fire goes nowhere. In the case of other *arahants*, who were
cremated after their *parinibbāna*, there is a left over as ashes for one to
perpetuate at least the memory of their existence. But here Venerable Dabba
Mallaputta, as if to drive a point home, through his psychic powers based on the
fire element, saw to it that neither ashes nor soot will mar his perfect
extinguishment in the eyes of the world. That is why the Buddha celebrated it
with these special utterances of joy.

So then the cessation of existence is itself Nibbāna. There is no everlasting
immortal Nibbāna awaiting the *arahants* at their *parinibbāna*.

That kind of argument the commentaries sometimes put forward is now and then
advanced by modern day writers and preachers, too, in their explanations. When
it comes to Nibbāna, they resort to two pet parables of recent origin, the
parable of the tortoise and the parable of the frog.

In the former, a tortoise goes down into the water and the fishes ask him where
he came from. The tortoise replies that he came from land. In order to determine
what sort of a thing land is, the fishes go on asking the tortoise a number of
questions based on various qualities of water. To each question the tortoise has
to reply in the negative, since land has none of the qualities of water.

The parable of the frog is much the same. When it gets into water it has to say
'no no' to every question put by the toad, still unfamiliar with land. To make
the parables convincing, those negative answers, the 'no-nos', are compared to
the strings of negative terms that are found in the sutta passages dealing with
the *arahattaphalasamādhi*, which we have already quoted.

For instance, to prove their point those writers and teachers would resort to
the famous *Udāna* passage beginning with:

> *Atthi, bhikkhave, tad āyatanaṁ, yattha n'eva pathavī na āpo na tejo na vāyo
> na ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ na viññāṇānañcāyatanaṁ na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ na
> nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ na ayaṁ loko na paraloko na ubho candimasūriyā
> ...*[^fn664]
>
> There is, monks, that sphere, in which there is neither earth, nor water, nor
> fire, nor air; neither the sphere of infinite space, nor the sphere of
> infinite consciousness, nor the sphere of nothingness, nor the sphere of
> neither-perception-nor-non-perception; neither this world nor the world
> beyond, nor the sun and the moon ...

But we have reasonably pointed out that those passages do not in any way refer
to a non-descript realm into which the *arahants* enter after their demise, a
realm that the tortoise and the frog cannot describe. Such facile explanations
contradict the deeper teachings on the cessation of existence, dependent arising
and not self. They create a lot of misconceptions regarding Nibbāna as the
ultimate aim.

The purpose of all those arguments is to assert that Nibbāna is definitely not
an annihilation. The ideal of an everlasting Nibbāna is held out in order to
obviate nihilistic notions. But the Buddha himself has declared that when he is
preaching about the cessation of existence, those who held on to eternalist
views wrongly accused him for being an annihilationist, who teaches about the
annihilation, destruction and non-existence of a truly existing being, *sato
satassa ucchedaṁ vināsaṁ vibhavaṁ paññāpeti.*[^fn665]

On such occasions, the Buddha did not in any way incline towards eternalism in
order to defend himself. He did not put forward the idea of an everlasting
Nibbāna to counter the accusation. Instead, he drew attention to the three
signata and the four noble truths and solved the whole problem. He maintained
that the charge is groundless and utterly misconceived, and concluded with the
memorable declaration:

> *pubbe cāhaṁ, bhikkhave, etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi, dukkhassa ca
> nirodhaṁ*,
>
> formerly as well as now, O monks, I point out only a suffering and a cessation
> of that suffering.

Even the term *tathāgata*, according to him, is not to be conceived as a self.
It is only a mass of suffering that has come down through *saṁsāra*, due to
ignorance. The so-called existence, *bhava*, is an outcome of grasping,
*upādāna*. When grasping ceases, existence comes to an end. That itself is the
cessation of existence, *bhavanirodha*, which is Nibbāna.

As the term *anupādā parinibbāna* suggests, there is no grasping in the
experience of the cessation of existence. It is only when one is grasping
something that he can be identified with it, or reckoned by it. When one lets go
of everything, he goes beyond reckoning. Of course, even the commentaries
sometimes use the expression *apaññattikabhāvaṁ gatā*,[^fn666] "gone to the
state beyond designation" with regard to the *parinibbāna* of *arahants*.

Nevertheless, they tacitly grant a destination, which in their opinion defies
definition. Such vague arguments are riddled with contradictions. They obfuscate
the deeper issues of the Dhamma, relating to *paṭicca samuppāda* and *anattā*,
and seek to perpetuate personality view by slanting towards eternalism.

It is to highlight some extremely subtle aspects of the problem of Nibbāna that
we brought out all these arguments today.
