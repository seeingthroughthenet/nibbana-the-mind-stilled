With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks.

This is the twelfth sermon in the series of sermons on Nibbāna. At the beginning
of our last sermon, we brought up the two terms *papañca* and *nippapañca*,
which help us rediscover quite a deep dimension in Buddhist philosophy, hidden
under the sense of time. In our attempt to clarify the meaning of these two
terms, initially with the help of the *Madhupiṇḍikasutta*, what we could
determine so far is the fact that *papañca* signifies a certain gross state in
sense-perception.

Though in ordinary linguistic usage *papañca* meant 'elaboration',
'circumlocution', and 'verbosity', the *Madhupiṇḍikasutta* has shown us that in
the context of sensory perception it has some special significance. It portrays
how a person, who directed sense perception, is overwhelmed by
*papañcasaññāsaṅkhā* with regard to sense-objects relating to the three periods
of time, past, present, and future, as a result of his indulging in *papañca*
based on reasoning about percepts.

All this goes to show that *papañca* has connotations of some kind of delusion,
obsession, and confusion arising in a man's mind due to sense perception.

In explaining the meaning of this term, commentators very often make use of
words like *pamatta*, 'excessively intoxicated', 'indolent', *pamāda*,
'headlessness', and *madana*, 'intoxication'. For example:

> *Kenaṭṭhena papañco? Mattapamattākārapāpanaṭṭhena papañco*.[^fn405]
>
> *Papañca* in what sense? In the sense that it leads one on to a state of
> intoxication and indolence.

Sometimes it is commented on as follows:

> *papañcitā ca honti pamattākārapattā.*[^fn406]
>
> They are subject to *papañca*, that is, they become more or less inebriated or
> indolent.

Or else it is explained as:

> *madanākārasaṇṭhito kilesapapañco.*[^fn407]
>
> *Papañca* of a defiling nature which is of an inebriating character.

On the face of it, *papañca* looks like a term similar in sense to *pamāda*,
indolence, heedlessness. But there is a subtle difference in meaning between
them.

*Pamāda*, even etymologically, conveys the basic idea of 'excessive
intoxication'. It has a nuance of inactivity or inefficiency, due to
intoxication. The outcome of such a state of affairs is either negligence or
heedlessness.

But as we have already pointed out, *papañca* has an etymological background
suggestive of expansion, elaboration, verbosity and circumlocution. Therefore,
it has no connotations of inactivity and inefficiency. On the other hand, it
seems to imply an inability to reach the goal due to a deviation from the
correct path.

Let us try to understand the distinction in meaning between *pamāda* and
*papañca* with the help of an illustration. Suppose we ask someone to go on an
urgent errant to Colombo. If instead of going to Colombo, he goes to the nearest
tavern and gets drunk and sleeps there – that is a case of *pamāda*. If, on the
other hand, he takes to a long labyrinthine road, avoiding the shortest cut to
Colombo, and finally reaches Kandy instead of Colombo – that is *papañca*.

There is such a subtle difference in the nuances associated with these two
terms. Incidentally, there is a couplet among the Sixes of the *Aṅguttara
Nikāya*, which sounds like a distant echo of the illustration we have already
given.

> *Yo papañcam anuyutto* \
> *papañcābhirato mago,* \
> *virādhayī so Nibbānaṁ,* \
> *yogakkhemaṁ anuttaraṁ.*
> 
> *Yo ca papañcaṁ hitvāna,* \
> *nippapañca pade rato,* \
> *ārādhayī so Nibbānaṁ,* \
> *yogakkhemaṁ anuttaraṁ.*[^fn408]
> 
> The fool who indulges in *papañca*, \
> Being excessively fond of it, \
> Has missed the way to Nibbāna, \
> The incomparable freedom from bondage.
> 
> He who, having given up *papañca*, \
> delights in the path to *nippapañca*, \
> Is well on the way to Nibbāna, \
> The incomparable freedom from bondage.

In this way we can understand the difference between the two words *papañca* and
*pamāda* in respect of the nuances associated with them.

Commentaries very often explain the term *papañca* simply as a synonym of
craving, conceit, and views, *taṇhādiṭṭhimānānam etaṁ adhivacanaṁ*.[^fn409] But
this does not amount to a definition of *papañca* as such. It is true that these
are instances of *papañca,* for even in the *Madhupiṇḍikasutta* we came across
the three expressions *abhinanditabbaṁ, abhivaditabbaṁ,* and *ajjhositabbaṁ*,
suggestive of them.[^fn410]

*Abhinanditabbaṁ* means 'what is worth delighting in', *abhivaditabbaṁ* means
'what is worth asserting', *ajjhositabbaṁ* means 'what is worth clinging on to'.
These three expressions are very often used in the discourses to denote the
three defilements craving, conceit and views.

That is to say, 'delighting in' by way of craving with the thought 'this is
mine'; 'asserting' by way of conceit with the thought 'this am I'; and 'clinging
on to' with the dogmatic view 'this is my soul'.

Therefore the commentarial exegesis on *papañca* in terms of craving, conceit
and views is to a great extent justifiable. However, what is particularly
significant about the term *papañca* is that it conveys the sense of
proliferation and complexity of thought, on the lines of those three basic
tendencies. That is why the person concerned is said to be 'overwhelmed by
*papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*'.[^fn411]

Here we need to clarify for ourselves the meaning of the word *saṅkhā.*
According to the commentary, it means 'parts', *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā'ti ettha
saṅkhā'ti koṭṭhāso,*[^fn412] "'*papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*', herein '*saṅkhā*' means
parts". In that case *papañcasaṅkhā* could be rendered as 'parts of *papañca*',
which says nothing significant about *saṅkhā* itself. On the other hand, if one
carefully examines the contexts in which the terms *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā* and
*papañcasaṅkhā* are used in the discourses, one gets the impression that
*saṅkhā* means something deeper than 'part' or 'portion'.

*Saṅkhā, samaññā* and *paññatti* are more or less synonymous terms. Out of them,
*paññatti* is fairly well known as a term for 'designation'. 

*Saṅkhā* and *samaññā* are associated in sense with *paññatti*. *Saṅkhā* means
'reckoning' and *samaññā* is 'appellation'. These three terms are often used in
connection with worldly usage.

We come across quite a significant reference, relevant to this question of
*papañca*, in the *Niruttipathasutta* of the *Khandhasaṁyutta* in the *Saṁyutta
Nikāya.* It runs:

> *Tayome, bhikkhave, niruttipathā, adhivacanapathā, paññattipathā asaṅkiṇṇā
> asaṅkiṇṇapubbā, na saṅkīyanti, na saṅkīyissanti, appaṭikuṭṭhā samaṇehi
> brāhmaṇehi viññūhi. Katame tayo? Yaṁ, bhikkhave, rūpaṁ atītaṁ niruddhaṁ
> vipariṇataṁ 'ahosī'ti tassa saṅkhā, 'ahosī'ti tassa samaññā, 'ahosī'ti tassa
> paññatti, na tassa saṅkhā 'atthī'ti, na tassa saṅkhā 'bhavissatī'ti.*[^fn413]
>
> Monks, there are these three pathways of linguistic usage, of synonyms and of
> designation, that are not mixed up, have never been mixed up, that are not
> doubted and will not be doubted, and are undespised by intelligent recluses
> and brahmins. What are the three? Whatever form, monks, that is past, ceased,
> transformed, 'it was' is the reckoning for it, 'it was' is its appellation,
> 'it was' is its designation, it is not reckoned as 'it is', it is not reckoned
> as 'it will be'.

The burden of this discourse, as it proceeds in this way, is the maxim that the
three periods of time should never be mixed up or confounded. For instance, with
regard to that form that is past, a verb in the past tense is used. One must not
imagine what is past to be existing as something present. Nor should one imagine
whatever belongs to the future as already existing in the present.

Whatever has been, is past. Whatever is, is present. It is a common mistake to
conceive of something that is yet to come as something already present, and to
imagine whatever is past also as present. This is the confusion the world is in.
That is why those recluses and brahmins, who are wise, do not mix them up.

Just as the above quoted paragraph speaks of whatever is past, so the discourse
continues to make similar statements with regard to whatever is present or
future. It touches upon all the five aggregates, for instance, whatever form
that is present is reckoned as 'it is', and not as 'it was' or 'it will be'.
Similarly, whatever form that is yet to come is reckoned as 'it will be', and
not as 'it was' or 'it is'. This is how the *Niruttipathasutta* lays down the
basic principle of not confounding the linguistic usages pertaining to the three
periods of time.

Throughout this discourse, the term *saṅkhā* is used in the sense of
'reckoning'. In fact, the three terms *saṅkhā, samaññā* and *paññatti* are used
somewhat synonymously in the same way as *nirutti, adhivacana* and *paññatti*.
All these are in sense akin to each other in so far as they represent the
problem of worldly usage.

This makes it clear that the intriguing term *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā* has a
relevance to the question of language and modes of linguistic usages. The term
could thus be rendered as 'reckonings born of prolific perceptions'.

If we are to go deeper into the significance of the term *saṅkhā*, we may say
that its basic sense in linguistic usage is connected with numerals, since it
means 'reckoning'. As a matter of fact, numerals are more primitive than
letters, in a language.

To perceive is to grasp a sign of permanence in something. Perception has the
characteristic of grasping a sign. It is with the help of signs that one
recognizes. Perceptions of forms, perceptions of sounds, perceptions of smells,
perceptions of tastes, etc., are so many ways of grasping signs.

Just as a party going through a forest would blaze a trail with an axe in order
to find their way back with the help of notches on the trees, so does perception
catch a sign in order to be able to recognize.

This perception is like the groping of a blind man, fumbling in the dark. There
is a tendency in the mind to grasp a sign after whatever is felt. So it gives
rise to perceptions of forms, perceptions of sounds, etc. A sign necessarily
involves the notion of permanence. That is to say, a sign stands for permanence.
A sign has to remain unchanged until one returns to it to recognize it. That is
also the secret behind the mirage nature of perception as a whole.[^fn414]

As a matter of fact, the word *saññā*, used to denote perception as such,
primarily means the 'sign', 'symbol', or 'mark', with which one recognizes. But
recognition alone is not enough. What is recognized has to be made known to the
world, to the society at large. That is why *saññā*, or perception, is followed
by *saṅkhā*, or reckoning.

The relationship between *saṅkhā, samaññā* and *paññatti* in this connection
could also be explained. *Saṅkhā* as 'reckoning' or 'counting' totals up or adds
up into groups of, say, five or six. It facilitates our work, particularly in
common or communal activities. So the most primitive symbol in a language is the
numeral.

*Samaññā*, or appellation, is a common agreement as to how something should be
known. If everyone had its own may of making known, exchange of ideas would be
impossible. *Paññatti*, or designation, determines the pattern of whatever is
commonly agreed upon. This way we can understand the affinity of meaning between
the terms *saṅkhā, samaññā* and *paññatti*.

Among them, *saṅkhā* is the most primitive form of reckoning. It does not simply
mean reckoning or adding up in terms of numerals. It is characteristic of
language too, as we may infer from the occurrence of the expression *saṅkhaṁ
gacchati* in many discourses. There the reckoning meant is a particular
linguistic usage. We come across a good illustration of such a linguistic usage
in the *Mahāhatthipadopamasutta*, where Venerable Sāriputta is addressing his
fellow monks.

> *Seyyathāpi, āvuso, kaṭṭhañca paṭicca valliñca paṭicca tiṇañca paṭicca
> mattikañca paṭicca ākāso parivārito agāraṁ tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati; evameva
> kho, āvuso, aṭṭhiñca paṭicca nahāruñca paṭicca maṁsañca paṭicca cammañca
> paṭicca ākāso parivārito rūpaṁ tveva saṅkhaṁ gacchati.*[^fn415]
>
> Friends, just as when space is enclosed by timber and creepers, grass and
> clay, it comes to be reckoned as 'a house'; even so, when space is enclosed by
> bones and sinews, flesh and skin, it comes to be reckoned as 'material form'.

Here the expression *saṅkhaṁ gacchati* stands for a designation as a concept. It
is the way something comes to be known.

Let us go for another illustration from a sermon by the Buddha himself. It is
one that throws a flood of light on some deep aspects of Buddhist philosophy,
relating to language, grammar and logic. It comes in the *Poṭṭhapādasutta* of
the *Dīgha Nikāya*, where the Buddha is exhorting Citta Hatthisāriputta.

> *Seyyathāpi, Citta, gavā khīraṁ, khīramhā dadhi, dadhimhā navanītaṁ,
> navanītamhā sappi, sappimhā sappimaṇḍo. Yasmiṁ samaye khīraṁ hoti, neva
> tasmiṁ samaye dadhī'ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na navanītan'ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na
> sappī'ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na sappimaṇḍo'ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, khīraṁ tveva
> tasmiṁ samaye saṅkhaṁ gacchati.*[^fn416]
>
> Just, Citta, as from a cow comes milk, and from milk curds, and from curds
> butter, and from butter ghee, and from ghee junket. But when it is milk, it is
> not reckoned as curd or butter or ghee or junket, it is then simply reckoned
> as milk.

We shall break up the relevant quotation into three parts, for facility of
comment. This is the first part giving the introductory simile. The simile
itself looks simple enough, though it is suggestive of something deep. The
simile is in fact extended to each of the other stages of milk formation, namely
curd, butter, ghee, and junket, pointing out that in each case, it is not
reckoned otherwise. Now comes the corresponding doctrinal point.

> *Evameva kho, Citta, yasmiṁ samaye oḷāriko attapaṭilābho hoti, neva tasmiṁ
> samaye manomayo attapaṭilābho'ti saṅkhaṁ gacchati, na arūpo attapaṭilābho'ti
> saṅkhaṁ gacchati, oḷāriko attapaṭilābho tveva tasmiṁ samaye saṅkhaṁ gacchati.*
>
> Just so, Citta, when the gross mode of personality is going on, it is not
> reckoned as 'the mental mode of personality', nor as 'the formless mode of
> personality', it is then simply reckoned as 'the gross mode of personality'.

These three modes of personality correspond to the three planes of existence,
the sensuous, the form, and the formless. The first refers to the ordinary
physical frame, sustained by material food, *kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho*, enjoying
the sense pleasures.[^fn417] At the time a person is in this sensual field,
possessing the gross mode of personality, one must not imagine that the mental
mode or the formless mode of personality is hidden in him.

This is the type of confusion the ascetics entrenched in a soul theory fell
into. They even conceived of self as fivefold, encased in concentric shells.
Whereas in the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad* one comes across the *pañcakośa* theory,
the reference here is to three states of the self, as gross, mental and formless
modes of personality. Out of the five selves known to *Upaniṣadic* philosophy,
namely *annamaya, prāṇamaya, saṁjñāmaya, vijñāṇamaya* and *ānandamaya*, only
three are mentioned here, in some form or other. The gross mode of personality
corresponds to *annamayātman*, the mental mode of personality is equivalent to
*saṁjñāmayātman*, while the formless mode of personality stands for
*vijñāṇamayātman*.

The correct perspective of understanding this distinction is provided by the
milk simile. Suppose someone gets a *jhāna* and attains to a mental mode of
personality. He should not imagine that the formless mode of personality is
already latent in him. Nor should he think that the former gross mode of
personality is still lingering in him. They are just temporary states, to be
distinguished like milk and curd. This is the moral the Buddha is trying to
drive home.

Now we come to the third part of the quotation, giving the Buddha's conclusion,
which is extremely important.

> *Imā kho, Citta, lokasamaññā lokaniruttiyo lokavohārā lokapaññattiyo, yāhi
> Tathāgato voharati aparāmasaṁ.*
>
> For all these, Citta, are worldly apparitions, worldly expressions, worldly
> usages, worldly designations, which the Tathāgata makes use of without
> tenacious grasping.

It is the last word in the quotation, *aparāmasaṁ,* which is extremely
important. There is no tenacious grasping. The Buddha uses the language much in
the same way as parents make use of a child's homely prattle, for purpose of
meditation.

He had to present this Dhamma, which goes against the current,[^fn418] through
the medium of worldly language, with which the worldlings have their transaction
in defilements. That is probably the reason why the Buddha at first hesitated to
preach this Dhamma. He must have wondered how he can convey such a deep Dhamma
through the terminology, the grammar and the logic of worldlings.

All this shows the immense importance of the *Poṭṭhapādasutta*. If the ordinary
worldling presumes that ghee is already inherent in the milk obtained from the
cow, he will try to argue it out on the grounds that after all it is milk that
becomes ghee. And once it becomes ghee, he might imagine that milk is still to
be found in ghee, in some latent form.

As a general statement, this might sound ridiculous. But even great philosophers
were unaware of the implications of their theories. That is why the Buddha had
to come out with this homely milk simile, to bring them to their senses. Here
lies the secret of the soul theory. It carried with it the implication that past
and future also exist in the same sense as the present.

The Buddha, on the other hand, uses the verb *atthi*, 'is', only for what exists
in the present. He points out that, whatever is past, should be referred to as
*ahosi*, 'was', and whatever is yet to come, in the future, should be spoken of
as *bhavissati*, 'will be'. This is the fundamental principle underlying the
*Niruttipathasutta* already quoted. Any departure from it would give rise to
such confusions as referred to above.

Milk, curd, butter and ghee are merely so many stages in a certain process. The
worldlings, however, have put them into watertight compartments, by designating
and circumscribing them. They are caught up in the conceptual trap of their own
making.

When the philosophers started working out the logical relationship between cause
and effect, they tended to regard these two as totally unrelated to each other.
Since milk becomes curd, either the two are totally different from each other,
or curd must already be latent in milk for it to become curd. This is the kind
of dilemma their logic posed for them.

Indian philosophical systems reflect a tendency towards such logical subtleties.
They ended up with various extreme views concerning the relation between cause
and effect. In a certain school of Indian philosophy, known as *ārambhavāda*,
effect is explained as something totally new, unrelated to the cause. Other
schools of philosophy, such as *satkāriyavāda* and *satkaraṇavāda*, also arose
by confusing this issue. For them, effect is already found hidden in the cause,
before it comes out. Yet others took only the cause as real. Such extreme
conclusions were the result of forgetting the fact that all these are mere
concepts in worldly usage. Here we have a case of getting caught up in a
conceptual trap of one's own making.

This confusion regarding the three periods of time, characteristic of such
philosophers, could be illustrated with some folk tales and fables, which
lucidly bring out a deep truth.

There is, for instance, the tale of the goose that lays golden eggs, well known
to the West. A certain goose used to lay a golden egg every day. Its owner, out
of excessive greed, thought of getting all the as yet ones. He killed the goose
and opened it up, only to come to grief. He had wrongly imagined the future to
be already existing in the present.

This is the kind of blunder the soul theorists also committed. In the field of
philosophy, too, the prolific tendency led to such subtle complications. It is
not much different from the proliferations indulged in by the ordinary worldling
in his daily life. That is why reckonings born of prolific perception are said
to be so overwhelming. One is overwhelmed by one's own reckonings and figurings
out, under the influence of prolific perceptions.

An Indian poet once spotted a ruby, shining in the moon light, and eagerly
approached it, enchanted by it, only to find a blood red spittle of beetle. We
often come across such humorous stories in literature, showing the pitfalls of
prolific conceptualisation.

The introductory story, leading up to the *Dhammapada* verse on the rambling
nature of the mind, *dūraṅgamaṁ ekacaraṁ, asarīraṁ guhāsayaṁ*, as recorded in
the commentary to the *Dhammapada,* is very illustrative.[^fn419]

The pupil of venerable Saṅgharakkhita Thera, a nephew of his, indulged in a
*papañca* while fanning his teacher. In his imagination, he disrobed, got
married, had a child, and was coming in a chariot with his wife and child to see
his former teacher. The wife, through carelessness, dropped the child and the
chariot run away. So he whipped his wife in a fit of anger, only to realize that
he had dealt a blow on his teacher's head with the fan still in his hand. Being
an *arahant* with psychic powers, his teacher immediately understood the pupil's
state of mind, much to the latter's discomfiture.

A potter in Sanskrit literature smashed his pots in a sort of business *papañca*
and was remorseful afterwards. Similarly the proud milk maid in English
literature dropped a bucket of milk on her head in a day dream of her rosy
future. In all these cases one takes as present something that is to come in the
future. This is a serious confusion between the three periods of time. The
perception of permanence, characteristic of concepts, lures one away from
reality into a world of fantasy, with the result that one is overwhelmed and
obsessed by it.

So this is what is meant by *papañcasaññāsaṅkhasamudācāra*. So overwhelming are
reckonings born of prolific perception. As we saw above, the word *saṅkhā* is
therefore nearer to the idea of reckoning than that of part or portion.

Tathāgatas are free from such reckonings born of prolific perception,
*papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*, because they make use of worldly linguistic usages,
conventions and designation, being fully aware of their worldly origin, as if
they were using a child's language.

When an adult uses a child's language, he is not bound by it. Likewise, the
Buddhas and *arahants* do not forget that these are worldly usages. They do not
draw any distinction between the relative and the absolute with regard to those
concepts. For them, they are merely concepts and designations in worldly usage.
That is why the Tathāgatas are said to be free from *papañca*, that is to say
they are *nippapañca*, whereas the world delights in *papañca.* This fact is
clearly expressed in the following verse in the *Dhammapada*.

> *Ākāse va padaṁ natthi* \
> *samaṇo natthi bāhire,* \
> *papañcābhiratā pajā,* \
> *nippapañcā Tathāgatā.*[^fn420]
> 
> No track is there in the air, \
> And no recluse elsewhere, \
> This populace delights in prolificity, \
> But 'Thus-gone-ones' are non-prolific.

It is because the Tathāgatas are non-prolific that *nippapañca* is regarded as
one of the epithets of Nibbāna in a long list of thirty-three.[^fn421]

Like *dukkhūpasama*, quelling of suffering, *papañcavūpasama,* 'quelling of
prolificity', is also recognized as an epithet of Nibbāna. It is also referred
to as *papañcanirodha*, 'cessation of prolificity'. We come across such
references to Nibbāna in terms of *papañca* quite often.

The Tathāgatas are free from *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*, although they make use of
worldly concepts and designations. In the *Kalahavivādasutta* we come across the
dictum *saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā*,[^fn422] according to which reckonings
through prolificity arise from perception. Now the Tathāgatas have gone beyond
the pale of perception in attaining wisdom. That is why they are free from
*papañcasaññāsaṅkhā*, reckonings born of prolific perception.

Such reckonings are the lot of those who grope in the murk of ignorance, under
the influence of perception. Since Buddhas and *arahants* are enlightened with
wisdom and released from the limitations of perception, they do not entertain
such reckonings born of prolific perception.

Hence we find the following statement in the *Udāna*:

> *Tena kho pana samayena Bhagavā attano papañcasaññāsaṅkhāpahānaṁ
> paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti.*[^fn423]
>
> And at that time the Exalted One was seated contemplating his own abandonment
> of reckonings born of prolific perception.

The allusion here is to the bliss of emancipation. Quite a meaningful verse also
occurs in this particular context.

> *Yassa papañcā ṭhiti ca natthi,* \
> *sandānaṁ palighañca vītivatto,* \
> *taṁ nittaṇhaṁ muniṁ carantaṁ,* \
> *nāvajānāti sadevako pi loko.*[^fn424]
> 
> To whom there are no proliferations and standstills, \
> Who has gone beyond the bond and the deadlock, \
> In that craving-free sage, as he fares along, \
> The world with its gods sees nothing to decry.

The two words *papañca* and *ṭhiti* in juxtaposition highlight the primary sense
of *papañca* as a 'rambling' or a 'straying away'. According to the
*Nettippakaraṇa*, the idiomatic standstill mentioned here refers to the
latencies, *anusaya*.[^fn425]

So the rambling *papañcas* and doggedly persisting *anusayas* are no longer
there. The two words *sanḍānaṁ* and *palighaṁ* are also metaphorically used in
the Dhamma. Views, *diṭṭhi*, are the bond, and ignorance, *avijjā*, is the
deadlock.[^fn426]

The fact that *papañca* is characteristic of worldly thoughts, connected with
the household life, emerges from the following verse in the *Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta*
of the *Saṁyutta Nikāya*.

> *Papañcasaññā itarītarā narā,* \
> *papañcayantā upayanti saññino,* \
> *manomayaṁ gehasitañca sabbaṁ,* \
> *panujja nekkhammasitaṁ irīyati.*[^fn427]
> 
> The common run of humanity, impelled by prolific perception, \
> Approach their objects with rambling thoughts, limited by perception as they are, \
> Dispelling all what is mind-made and connected with the household, \
> One moves towards that which is connected with renunciation.

The approach meant here is comparable to the approach of that imaginative poet
towards the ruby shining in moonlight, only to discover a spittle of beetle. The
last two lines of the verse bring out the correct approach of one who is aiming
at Nibbāna. It requires the dispelling of such daydreams connected with the
household as entertained by the nephew of Venerable Saṅgharakkhita Thera.

Worldlings are in the habit of constructing speculative views by taking too
seriously linguistic usage and grammatical structure. All pre-Buddhistic
philosophers made such blunders as the confusion between milk and curd. Their
blunders were mainly due to two reasons, namely, the persistent latency towards
perception and the dogmatic adherence to views. It is precisely these two points
that came up in the very first statement of the *Madhupiṇḍikasutta*, discussed
in our previous sermon.

That is to say, they formed the gist of the Buddha's cursory reply to the Sakyan
Daṇḍapāṇi's question. For the latter it was a riddle and that is why he raised
his eyebrows, wagged his tongue and shook his head. The question was:

> What does the recluse assert and what does he proclaim?[^fn428]

The Buddha's reply was:

> According to whatever doctrine one does not quarrel or dispute with anyone in
> the world, such a doctrine do I preach. And due to whatever statements,
> perceptions do not underlie as latencies, such statements do I proclaim.

This might well appear a strange paradox. But since we have already made some
clarification of the two terms *saññā* and *paññā*, we might as well bring up
now an excellent quotation to distinguish the difference between these two. It
is in fact the last verse in the *Māgandiyasutta* of the *Sutta Nipāta*, the
grand finale as it were.

> *Saññāviratassa na santi ganthā,* \
> *paññāvimuttassa na santi mohā,* \
> *saññañca diṭṭhiñca ye aggahesuṁ,* \
> *te ghaṭṭhayantā vicaranti loke.*[^fn429]
> 
> To one unattached to percepts no bonds exist, \
> In one released through wisdom no delusions persist, \
> But they that cling to percepts and views, \
> Go about rambling in this world.

In the *Pupphasutta* of the *Khandhasaṁyutta* one comes across the following
declaration of the Buddha.

> *Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, lokena vivadāmi, loko va mayā vivadati.*[^fn430]
>
> Monks, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that is disputing with
> me.

This looks more or less like a contradictory statement, as if one would say "he
is quarrelling with me but I am not quarrelling with him". However, the truth of
the statement lies in the fact that the Buddha did not hold on to any view. Some
might think that the Buddha also held on to some view or other. But he was
simply using the child's language, for him there was nothing worth holding on to
in it.

There is a Canonical episode which is a good illustration of this fact. One of
the most well-known among the debates the Buddha had with ascetics of other
sects is the debate with Saccaka, the ascetic. An account of it is found in the
*Cūḷasaccakasutta* of the *Majjhima Nikāya*.

The debate had all the outward appearance of a hot dispute. However, towards the
end of it, the Buddha makes the following challenge to Saccaka:

> As for you, Aggivessana, drops of sweat have come down from your forehead,
> soaked through your upper robe and reached the ground. But, Aggivessana, there
> is no sweat on my body now.

So saying he uncovered his golden-hued body in that assembly,

> *iti bhagavā tasmiṁ parisatiṁ suvaṇṇavaṇṇaṁ kāyaṁ vivari*.[^fn431]

Even in the midst of a hot debate, the Buddha had no agitation because he did
not adhere to any views. There was for him no bondage in terms of craving,
conceit and views. Even in the thick of a heated debate the Buddha was uniformly
calm and cool.

It is the same with regard to perception. Percepts do not persist as a latency
in him. We spoke of name-and-form as an image or a reflection. Buddhas do no
have the delusion arising out of name-and-form, since they have comprehended it
as a self-image. There is a verse in the *Sabhiyasutta* of the *Sutta Nipāta*
which puts across this idea.

> *Anuvicca papañca nāmarūpaṁ,* \
> *ajjhattaṁ bahiddhā ca rogamūlaṁ,* \
> *sabbarogamūlabandhanā pamutto,* \
> *anuvidito tādi pavuccate tathattā.*[^fn432]
> 
> Having understood name-and-form, \
> <span class="vin"></span> which is a product of prolificity, \
> And which is the root of all malady within and without, \
> He is released from bondage to the root of all maladies, \
> That Such-like-one is truly known as \
> <span class="vin"></span> 'the one who has understood'.

Name-and-form is a product of *papañca*, the worldling's prolificity. We spoke
of the reflection of a gem in a pond and the image of a dog on a plank across
the stream.[^fn433] One's grasp on one's world of name-and-form is something
similar.

Now as for the Buddha, he has truly comprehended the nature of name-and-form.
Whatever maladies, complications and malignant conditions there are within
beings and around them, the root cause of all that malady is this *papañca
nāmarūpa*. To be free from it is to be 'such'. He is the one who has really
understood.

If we are to say something in particular about the latency of perception, we
have to pay special attention to the first discourse in the *Majjhima Nikāya*.
The advice usually given to one who picks up the *Majjhima Nikāya* these days is
to skip the very first sutta. Why? Because it is not easy to understand it. Even
the monks to whom it was preached could not understand it and were displeased.
"It is too deep for us, leave it alone."

But it must be pointed out that such an advice is not much different from asking
one to learn a language without studying the alphabet. This is because the first
discourse of the *Majjhima Nikāya*, namely the *Mūlapariyāyasutta*, enshrines an
extremely vital first principle in the entire field of Buddhist philosophy.

Just as much as the first discourse of the *Dīgha Nikāya,* namely the
*Brahmajālasutta*, is of great relevance to the question of views, even so the
*Mūlapariyāyasutta* is extremely important for its relevance to the question of
perception.

Now what is the basic theme of this discourse? There is a certain pattern in the
way objects occur to the mind and are apperceived. This discourse lays bare that
elementary pattern. The Buddha opens this discourse with the declaration,

> *sabbadhammamūlapariyāyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi,*[^fn434]
>
> monks, I shall preach to you the basic pattern of behaviour of all mind
> objects.

In a nutshell, the discourse deals with twenty-four concepts, representative of
concepts in the world. These are fitted into a schema to illustrate the attitude
of four types of persons towards them.

The twenty-four concepts mentioned in the sutta are:

> *paṭhavi, āpo, tejo, vāyo, bhūta, deva, Pajāpati, Brahma, Ābhassara,
> Subhakinha, Vehapphala, abhibhū, ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ, viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ,
> ākiñcañāyatanaṁ, nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ, diṭṭhaṁ, sutaṁ, mutaṁ, viññātaṁ,
> ekattaṁ, nānattaṁ, sabbaṁ, Nibbānaṁ.*
>
> Earth, water, fire, air, beings, gods, Pajāpati, Brahma, the Abhassara
> Brahmas, the Subhakinha Brahmas, the Vehapphala Brahmas, the overlord, the
> realm of infinite space, the realm of infinite consciousness, the realm of
> nothingness, the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the seen, the
> heard, the sensed, the cognised, unity, diversity, all, Nibbāna.

The discourse describes the differences of attitude in four types of persons
with regard to each of these concepts. The four persons are:

1. An untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for the Noble Ones and is
   unskilled in their Dhamma, *assutavā puthujjana*.

2. A monk who is in higher training, whose mind has not yet reached the goal and
   who is aspiring to the supreme security from bondage, *bhikkhu sekho
   appattamānaso.*

3. An *arahant* with taints destroyed who has lived the holy life, done what has
   to be done, laid down the burden, reached the goal, destroyed the fetters of
   existence and who is completely liberated through final knowledge, *arahaṁ
   khīṇāsavo*.

4. The Tathāgata, accomplished and fully enlightened, *Tathāgato arahaṁ
   sammāsambuddho*.

Out of these, the second category comprises the Stream-winner, the Once-returner
and the Non-returner. Though there are four types, according to the analysis of
their attitudes, the last two can be regarded as one type, since their attitudes
to those concepts are the same. So we might as well speak of three kinds of
attitudes. Let us now try to understand the difference between them.

What is the world-view of the untaught ordinary person, the worldling? The
Buddha describes it as follows:

> *Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito sañjānāti. Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito saññatvā paṭhaviṁ maññati,
> paṭhaviyā maññati, paṭhavito maññati, 'paṭhaviṁ me'ti maññati, paṭhaviṁ
> abhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? Apariññātaṁ tassā'ti vadāmi.*
>
> He perceives earth as 'earth'. Having perceived earth as 'earth', he imagines
> 'earth' as such, he imagines 'on the earth', he imagines 'from the earth', he
> imagines 'earth is mine', he delights in earth. Why is that? I say that it is
> because he has not fully comprehended it.

The untaught ordinary person can do no better than to perceive earth as 'earth',
since he is simply groping in the dark. So he perceives earth as 'earth' and
goes on imagining, for which the word used here is *maññati*, methinks. One
usually methinks when a simile or a metaphor occurs, as a figure of speech. But
here it is something more than that. Here it refers to an indulgence in a
deluded mode of thinking under the influence of craving, conceit and views.
Perceiving earth as 'earth', he imagines earth to be substantially 'earth'.

Then he resorts to inflection, to make it flexible or amenable to his
methinking. 'On the earth', 'from the earth', 'earth is mine', are so many
subtle ways of methinking, with which he finally finds delight in the very
concept of earth. The reason for all this is the fact that he has not fully
comprehended it.

Then comes the world-view of the monk who is in higher training, that is, the
*sekha*.

> *Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhijānāti. Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito abhiññāya paṭhaviṁ mā
> maññi, paṭhaviyā mā maññi, paṭhavito mā maññi, 'paṭhaviṁ me'ti mā maññi,
> paṭhaviṁ mābhinandi. Taṁ kissa hetu? Pariññeyyaṁ tassā'ti vadāmi.*
>
> He understands through higher knowledge earth as 'earth'. Having known through
> higher knowledge earth as 'earth', let him not imagine 'earth' as such, let
> him not imagine 'on the earth', let him not imagine 'from the earth', let him
> not imagine 'earth is mine', let him not delight in earth. Why is that? I say
> it is because it should be well comprehended by him.

As for the monk who is in higher training, he does not merely perceive, but
understands through higher knowledge.

Here we are against a peculiar expression, which is rather problematic, that is,
*mā maññi*.

The commentary simply glosses over with the words *maññatī'ti maññi*, taking it
to mean the same as *maññati,* "imagines".[^fn435] Its only explanation for the
use of this peculiar expression in this context is that the *sekha*, or the one
in higher training, has already done away with *diṭṭhimaññanā* or imagining in
terms of views, though he still has imaginings through craving and conceit. So,
for the commentary, *mā maññi* is a sort of mild recognition of residual
imagining, a dilly-dally phrase. But this interpretation is not at all
convincing.

Obviously enough the particle *mā* has a prohibitive sense here, and *mā maññi*
means 'let one not imagine', or 'let one not entertain imaginings', *maññanā*.

A clear instance of the use of this expression in this sense is found at the end
of the *Samiddhisutta*, discussed in an earlier sermon.[^fn436] Venerable
Samiddhi answered Venerable Sāriputta's catechism creditably and the latter
acknowledged it with a "well-done", *sādhu sādhu*, but cautioned him not to be
proud of it, *tena ca mā maññi*, "but do not be vain on account of it".[^fn437]

The use of the prohibitive particle with reference to the world-view of the monk
in higher training is quite apt, as he has to train himself in overcoming the
tendency to go on imagining. For him it is a step of training towards full
comprehension. That is why the Buddha concludes with the words: "Why is that? I
say it is because it should be well comprehended by him."
