> We are grateful for the dedicated work of the Venerable Saṅgha and lay supporters who have generously contributed their time, energy and resources to offer this Dhamma publication in service of the Buddhasāsana.

> *Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ sukhaṁ* "Nibbāna is the supreme bliss." In the words of the Venerable Author, "it is hoped that the mode of presentation will have a special appeal for those who are keen on *realizing* it."
> 
> We wish to share the abundant merit that arises from this wholesome endeavour with our parents, relatives and teachers who have been supporting and guiding us, and with all beings of the world. May they rejoice in the Dhamma and attain the bliss of Nibbāna!
