With the permission of the Most Venerable Great Preceptor and the assembly of
the venerable meditative monks. This is the fourteenth sermon in the series of
sermons on Nibbāna.

In our last sermon we gave a description of the forms of imaginings or
methinkings, which the Buddha had compared to an extremely subtle bondage of
Māra.

The *Yavakalāpisutta* of the *Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta* in the *Saṁyutta Nikāya* has
shown us that all kinds of thoughts concerning existence that stem from this
subtle conceit 'am', *asmimāna*, are mere imaginings or methinkings, and that
they are called a bondage of Māra, because they have the power to keep beings
shackled to existence.[^fn478]

We have seen how they follow a dichotomy, even like the dilemma posed by the
fivefold bondage of Vepacitti, the king of demons. Whether one thinks 'I shall
be' or 'I shall not be', one is in bondage to Māra. Whether one thinks 'I shall
be percipient' or 'I shall be non-percipient', or 'I shall be
neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient', one is still in bondage to Māra.

There is a dichotomy involved here. The fact that these imaginings, which follow
a dichotomy, must be transcended completely, as well as the way to transcend
them, has been preached by the Buddha to Venerable Pukkusāti in the
*Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* of the *Majjhima Nikāya*.

There is a pithy passage, forming the grand finale of this discourse, in which
the Buddha gives a resume. We propose to quote this passage at the very outset
as it scintillates with a majestic fervour of the Dhamma.

> *Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti, maññussave kho pana nappavattamāne
> muni santo ti vuccatīti, iti kho pan'etaṁ vuttaṁ. Kiñ c'etaṁ paṭicca vuttaṁ?*
>
> *Asmīti bhikkhu maññitam etaṁ, ayam aham asmīti maññitam etaṁ, bhavissan'ti
> maññitam etaṁ, na bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ, rūpī bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ,
> arūpī bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ, saññī bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ, asaññī
> bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ, nevasaññīnāsaññī bhavissan'ti maññitam etaṁ.*
>
> *Maññitaṁ, bhikkhu, rogo, maññitaṁ gaṇḍo, maññitaṁ sallaṁ. Sabbamaññitānaṁ
> tveva, bhikkhu, samatikkamā muni santo ti vuccati.*
>
> *Muni kho pana, bhikkhu, santo na jāyati na jiyyati na miyyati na kuppati na
> piheti. Tam pi'ssa bhikkhu natthi yena jāyetha, ajāyamāno kiṁ jiyyissati,
> ajiyyamāno kiṁ miyyissati, amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati, akuppamāno kissa
> pihessati?*
>
> *Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti, maññussave kho pana nappavattamāne
> muni santo ti vuccatīti, iti yaṁ taṁ vuttaṁ, idam etaṁ paṭicca
> vuttaṁ*.[^fn479]

In the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* we find the Buddha presenting some points as the
theme and gradually developing it, analysing, clarifying, and expatiating, as
the discourse proceeds. The opening sentence in the above paragraph is a
quotation of a part of that original statement of the Buddha, which forms the
theme. Here is the rendering:

> 'Steadied whereon the tides of imaginings no longer occur in him, and when the
> tides of imaginings occur no more in him, he is called a sage stilled', so it
> was said. And with reference to what was this said?
>
> 'Am', monk, is something imagined; 'I am this' is something imagined; 'I shall
> be' is something imagined; 'I shall not be' is something imagined; 'I shall be
> possessed of form' is something imagined; 'I shall be formless' is something
> imagined; 'I shall be percipient' is something imagined; 'I shall be
> non-percipient' is something imagined; 'I shall be
> neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient' is something imagined.
>
> The imagined is a disease, the imagined is an abscess, the imagined is a dart.
> It is with the surmounting of all what is imagined, monk, that a sage is
> called 'stilled'.
>
> The sage who is stilled is not born, nor does he age, nor does he die, nor is
> he shaken, and he has no longing. Even that is not in him whereby he might be
> born. Not being born, how shall he age? Not aging, how shall he die? Not
> dying, how shall he be shaken? Being unshaken, what shall he long for?
>
> So it was with reference to this, that it was said 'steadied whereon the tides
> of imaginings no longer occur in him, and when the tides of imagining occur no
> more in him, he is called a sage stilled'.

All this goes to show how relevant the question of imaginings is to the path
leading to Nibbāna. This pithy passage, which brings the discourse to a climax,
portrays how the sage is at peace when his mind is released by stemming the
tides of imaginings. He attains release from birth, decay and death, here and
now, because he has realized the cessation of existence in this very world.

It is in this light that we have to interpret the above statement "even that is
not in him whereby he might be born".

Dependent on existence is birth. Due to whatever postulate of existence one can
speak of a 'birth', even that existence is not in him. Not being born, how can
he age? How can he grow old or decay? This is because of the implicit
interrelation between conditions.

Here we can flash back to our analogy of a tree, mentioned earlier.[^fn480] In
order to explain the mutual interrelation between the concepts of birth, decay
and death, we brought up a simile, which however is not canonical. That is to
say, supposing there is some kind of a tree, the buds, the leaves, the flowers,
the fruits and the wood of which could be sold for making one's livelihood.

If five men trading in those items respectively are made to line up at some
particular stage in the growth of this tree and asked whether the tree is too
young or too old, the answers given might differ according to the individual
standpoint grasped in each case.

It turns out to be a difference of viewpoint. For instance, the man who makes
his living by selling the buds would reply that the tree is too old when the
buds turn into leaves. Similarly, when it is the season for the leaves to fall
and the flowers to bloom, one who trades in leaves might say that the tree is
too old. And when flowers turn into fruits, the florist's viewpoint would be
similar. In this way one can understand how this concept changes according to
what one grasps – that there is an implicit relativity about it.

Now, as for this sage, he has given up everything that he had grasped. Grasping
has been given up completely. Imagining, too, has been abandoned. Hence, not
being 'born', how shall he age? The sage has no postulate of existence. Since
there is no existence, there is no 'birth'. Because there is no birth, there is
no decay.

It is a well known fact that the term *jarā* implies both growth and decay. It
is after setting a limit that we speak of a process of 'decay', after 'growth'.
This limit, however, varies according to our individual standpoint grasped –
according to our point of view. That is what we have tried to illustrate by this
analogy.

Then we have the statement "not aging, how shall he die?" Since decay is an
approach to death, where there is no decay, there is no death. The fact that
there is no death we have already seen in our exposition of the significance of
the verses quoted above from the *Adhimutta Theragāthā*.[^fn481] When the
bandits got round to kill the Venerable Adhimutta, he declared:

> *Na me hoti ahosin'ti,* \
> *bhavissan'ti na hoti me,* \
> *saṅkhārā vibhavissanti,* \
> *tattha kā paridevanā?*[^fn482]
>
> It does not occur to me 'I was', \
> Nor does it occur to me 'I shall be', \
> Mere preparations will get destroyed, \
> What is there to lament?

This declaration exemplifies the above statement. When all graspings are given
up, there is no 'decay' or 'death'.

*Amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati,* "not dying, how shall he be shaken?" The verb
*kuppati* does not necessarily mean 'getting annoyed'. Here it means to be
'shaken up' or 'moved'. When one holds on to a standpoint, one gets shaken up if
someone else tries to dislodge him from that standpoint.

The deliverance in Nibbāna is called *akuppā cetovimutti*, the unshakeable
deliverance of the mind.[^fn483] All other deliverances of the mind, known to
the world, are shakeable, *kuppa*. They are unsteady. They shake before the pain
of death. Only Nibbāna is called *akuppā cetovimutti*, the unshakeable
deliverance of the mind.

So this peaceful sage, the *arahant*, established in that concentration of the
fruit of *arahanthood*, *arahatta phalasamādhi*, which is known as the
influx-free deliverance of the mind, *anāsavā cetovimutti*, and is endowed with
the wisdom proper to *arahanthood*, *paññāvimutti*, 'deliverance through
wisdom', is unshaken before death. His mind remains unshaken. That is why the
*arahant* Thera Venerable Adhimutta fearlessly made the above declaration to the
bandits.

Now as to the significance of the Buddha's statement:

> *amiyyamāno kiṁ kuppissati, akuppamāno kissa pihessati,*
>
> not dying, how shall he be shaken, and being unshaken, what shall he long
> for?

When there is no shock, no agitation or trembling, what does one long for?
*Pihā* means longing, desiring for something or other. In this context it refers
to that longing which arises at the moment of death in one who has not destroyed
craving.

It is as a consequence of that longing that he enters some form of existence,
according to his *kamma*. That longing is not there in this sage, for the simple
reason that he is unshaken before death. He has nothing to look forward to. No
desires or longings. *Akuppamāno kissa pihessati*, "being unshaken, what shall
he long for?"

It is obvious, therefore, that the concepts of birth, decay and death become
meaningless to this sage. That is precisely why he is at peace, having
transcended all imaginings.

All this goes to show, that Nibbāna is a state beyond decay and death. We can
clearly understand from this discourse why Nibbāna is known as a decayless,
deathless state, realizable in this very world. That sage has conquered decay
and death here and now, because he has realized the cessation of existence, here
and now.

This is something extremely wonderful about the *arahant*. He realizes the
cessation of existence in his attainment to the fruit of *arahanthood*. How does
he come to realize the cessation of existence? Craving is extinct in him, hence
there is no grasping. Where there is no grasping, there is no existence. Because
there is no existence, birth, decay and death, along with sorrow and
lamentation, cease altogether.

From the foregoing we could well infer that all those concepts like birth,
decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, come about as a
result of a heap of pervert perceptions, pervert thoughts and pervert views,
based on the conceit of an existence, the conceit 'am'.

These three kinds of perversions known as *saññāvipallāsa*, *cittavipallāsa* and
*diṭṭhivipallāsa* give rise to a mass of concepts of an imaginary
nature.[^fn484] The entire mass of suffering, summed up by the terms birth,
decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, are basically of a
mental origin.

For an illustration of this fact, we can go back to our analogy of winding some
strands into a rope, mentioned earlier.[^fn485] We pointed out that in the case
of some strands that are being mistakenly wound in the same direction, it is the
grasp in the middle that gives at least a semblance of a rope to it. So long as
there is no such grasping, the strands do not become knotty or tense, as they go
round and round.

It is only when someone grasps it in the middle that the strands begin to get
winded up, knotty and tense. What is called existence, or becoming, *bhava*,
follows the same norm.

True to the law of impermanence, everything in the world changes. But there is
something innocent in this change. Impermanence is innocuous in itself. We say
it is innocuous because it means no harm to anyone. It is simply the nature of
this world, the suchness, the norm. It can do us harm only when we grasp, just
as in the case of that quasi rope.

The tenseness between winding and unwinding, arising out of that grasp in the
middle, is comparable to what is called *bhavasaṅkhāra*, 'preparations for
existence'. *Saṅkhārā*, or preparations, are said to be dependent on *avijjā*,
or ignorance.

Now we can form an idea of the relationship between these two even from this
analogy of the rope. The grasp in the middle creates two ends, giving rise to a
dilemma. In the case of existence, too, grasping leads to an antinomian
conflict. To become a thing, is to disintegrate into another thing.

On a previous occasion we happened to discuss the significance of the term
*maññanā*, me-thinking or imagining, with reference to the verse:

*Yena yena hi
maññati, tato taṁ hoti aññathā.*[^fn486] *Maññanā* itself gives rise to a
'thing', which from its very inception goes on disintegrating into another
thing.

Just as much as grasping leads to the concept of two ends, to become a thing is
to start changing into another thing, that is, it comes under the sway of the
law of impermanence. Illustrations of this norm are sometimes to be met with in
the discourses, but their significance is often ignored.

The idea of the two ends and the middle sometimes finds expression in references
to an 'above', 'below' and 'across in the middle', *uddhaṁ, adho, tiriyaṁ
majjjhe*; or in the terms 'before', 'behind' and 'middle', *pure, pacchā,
majjhe*. Such references deal with some deep aspects of the Dhamma, relating to
Nibbāna.

As a good illustration, we may take up the following two verses from the
*Mettagūmāṇavapucchā* in the *Pārāyanavagga* of the *Sutta Nipāta*.

> *Yaṁ kiñci sampajānāsi,* \
> *uddhaṁ adho tiriyaṁ cāpi majjhe,* \
> *etesu nandiñca nivesanañca* \
> *panujja viññāṇaṁ bhave na tiṭṭhe.*
>
> *Evaṁ vihārī sato appamatto,* \
> *bhikkhu caraṁ hitvā mamāyitāni,* \
> *jātijaraṁ sokapariddavañca* \
> *idh'eva vidvā pajaheyya dukkhaṁ.*[^fn487]
>
> Whatever you may know to be \
> Above, below and across in the middle, \
> Dispel the delight and the tendency to dwell in them, \
> Then your consciousness will not remain in existence.
>
> A monk, endowed with understanding, \
> Thus dwelling mindful and heedful, \
> As he fares along giving up all possessions, \
> Would abandon even here and now \
> Birth, decay, sorrow, lamentation and suffering.

The word *idh'eva* occurring in the second verse is highly significant, in that
it means the abandonment of all those things here and now, not leaving it for an
existence to come.

In the *Mahāviyūhasutta* of the *Sutta Nipāta* also a similar emphasis is laid
on this idea of 'here and now'. About the *arahant* it is said that he has no
death or birth here and now:

> *cutūpapāto idha yassa natthi,*[^fn488]
>
> to whom, even here, there is no death or birth.

In this very world he has transcended them by making those two concepts
meaningless.

The word *nivesanaṁ*, occurring in the first verse, is also significant. It
means 'dwelling'. In consciousness there is a tendency to 'dwell in'. That is
why in some contexts it is said that form is the abode or dwelling place of
consciousness,

> *rūpadhātu kho, gahapati, viññāṇassa oko,*
>
> the form element, householder, is the abode of consciousness.[^fn489]

The terms *oka, niketa* and *nivesana* are synonymous, meaning 'abode', 'home',
or 'dwelling place'.

The nature of consciousness in general is to abide or dwell in. That
non-manifestative consciousness, *anidassana viññāṇa*, however, has got rid of
the tendency to abide or dwell in.

Now we can revert to the passage in the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta*, which speaks of an
occurrence of tides of imaginings. The passage actually begins with the words:

> *yatthaṭṭhitaṁ maññussavā nappavattanti*,
>
> steadied whereon the tides of imaginings occur no more in him.

The idea behind this occurrence of tides of imaginings is quite often
represented by the concept of *āsava*, influx. Sensuality, *kāma*, existence,
*bhava*, views, *diṭṭhi* and ignorance, *avijjā*, are referred to as 'influxes',
*āsavā*, or 'floods', *oghā*. These are the four kinds of *saṁsāric* habits that
continuously flow into the minds of beings.

The above mentioned sutta passage refers to a place steadied whereon the tides
of imaginings do not occur or flow in, a place that is free from their
'influence'. This is none other than Nibbāna, for which one of the epithets used
is *dīpa*, or island.[^fn490]

Since Nibbāna is called an island, some might take it literally to mean some
sort of a place in this world. In fact, this is the general concept of Nibbāna
some are prone to uphold in their interpretation of Nibbāna.

But why it is called an island is clearly explained for us by a discourse in the
*Pārāyanavagga* of the *Sutta Nipāta*, namely the *Kappamāṇavapucchā*. In this
sutta, the Brahmin youth Kappa poses the following question to the Buddha:

> *Majjhe sarasmiṁ tiṭṭhataṁ* \
> *oghe jāte mahabbhaye* \
> *jarāmaccuparetānaṁ* \
> *dīpaṁ pabrūhi, mārisa.* \
> *Tvañca me dīpam akkhāhi* \
> *yathayidaṁ nāparaṁ siyā.*[^fn491]
> 
> To them that stand midstream, \
> When the frightful floods flow forth, \
> To them in decay and death forlorn, \
> An island, sire, may you proclaim. \
> An island which none else excels, \
> Yea, such an isle, pray tell me sire.

And this is the Buddha's reply to it:

> *Akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ* \
> *etaṁ dīpaṁ anāparaṁ* \
> *'nibbānam' iti naṁ brūmi* \
> *jarāmaccuparikkhayaṁ.*[^fn492]
> 
> Owning naught, grasping naught, \
> The isle is this, none else besides, \
> Nibbāna – that is how I call that isle, \
> Wherein Decay is decayed and Death is dead.

The Buddha's reply makes it clear that the term Nibbāna stands for the
extinction of craving and grasping. The ideal of owning naught and grasping
naught is itself Nibbāna, and nothing else. If the term had any other
connotation, the Buddha would have mentioned it in this context.

It is indubitably clear, then, that the epithet *dīpaṁ*, or island, has to be
understood in a deeper sense when it refers to Nibbāna. It is that owning
nothing and grasping nothing, that puts an end to decay and death.

Though we have yet to finish the discussion of the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta*, the
stage is already set now to understand the significance of a certain brief
discourse in the *Udāna*, which is very often quoted in discussions on Nibbāna.
For facility of understanding, we shall take it up now, as it somehow fits into
the context.

> *Atthi, bhikkhave, ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ. No ce taṁ, bhikkhave,
> abhavissa ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ, nayidha jātassa bhūtassa katassa
> saṅkhatassa nissaraṇaṁ paññāyetha. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, atthi ajātaṁ
> abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ, tasmā jātassa bhūtassa katassa saṅkhatassa
> nissaraṇaṁ paññāyati*.[^fn493]
>
> Monks, there is a not-born, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded. Monks,
> if that not-born, not-become, not-made, not-compounded were not, there would
> be no stepping out here from what is born, become, made and compounded. But
> since, monks, there is a not-born, a not-become, a not-made, a not-compounded,
> therefore there is a stepping out from what is born, become, made and
> compounded.

The terms *ajātaṁ*, not-born, *abhūtaṁ*, not-become, *akataṁ*, not-made, and
*asaṅkhataṁ*, not-compounded, are all epithets for Nibbāna.

The Buddha declares that if not for this not-born, not-become, not-made,
not-compounded, there would be no possibility of stepping out or release here,
that is, in this very world, from the born, the become, the made and the
compounded.

The second half of the passage rhetorically reiterates and emphasises the same
fact. Now as to the significance of this profound declaration of the Buddha, we
may point out that the terms not-born, not-become, not-made, not-compounded,
suggest the emancipation of the *arahant's* mind from birth, becoming and
preparations, *saṅkhārā*. They refer to the cessation of birth, becoming and
preparations realized by the *arahant*. So then the significance of these terms
is purely psychological.

But the commentator, the Venerable Dhammapāla, pays little attention to the word
*idha*, 'here', in this passage, which needs to be emphasized.

The fact that there is a possibility here and now, of stepping out from the
state of being born, become, made and compounded, surely deserves emphasis,
since, until then, release from decay and death was thought to be possible only
in another dimension of existence, that is, after death.

The prospect of stepping out from decay and death here and now in this very
world has to be asserted for its novelty, which is why the declaration opens
with the word *atthi*, 'there is'.

However, most of the scholars who tried to interpret this passage in their
discussion on Nibbāna, instead of laying stress on the word *idha,* 'here',
emphasize the opening word *atthi*, 'there is', to prove that Nibbāna is some
form of reality absolutely existing somewhere.

As that passage from the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* on *maññanā*, which we discussed,
has shown us, the terms *ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ* and *asaṅkhataṁ* have to be
understood in a deeper sense.

Existence is a conceit deep rooted in the mind, which gives rise to a heap of
pervert notions. Its cessation, therefore, has also to be accomplished in the
mind and by the mind. This is the gist of the Buddha's exhortation.

Let us now come back to the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* to discuss another facet of it.
We started our discussion with the grand finale of that discourse, because of
its relevance to the question of *maññanā*.

However, as a matter of fact, this discourse preached by the Buddha to the
Venerable Pukkusāti is an exposition of a systematic path of practice for the
emancipation of the mind from imaginings or *maññanā*.

The discourse begins with the declaration:

> *chadhāturo ayaṁ, bhikkhu, puriso*
>
> monk, man as such is a combination of six elements.[^fn494]

The worldling thinks that a being, *satta* (Sanskrit *sattva*), exists at a
higher level of reality than inanimate objects.

Now what did the Buddha do to explode this concept of a being in his discourse
to Venerable Pukkusāti? He literally thrashed out that concept, by breaking up
this 'man' into his basic elements and defining him as a bundle of six elements,
namely earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness.

As the discourse proceeds, he explains in an extremely lucid manner how one can
detach one's mind from each of these elements. We happened to mention at the
very outset that the depth of the Dhamma has to be seen through lucidity and not
through complicated over-drawings. In fact, this discourse exhibits such
lucidity.

The meditation subject of elements, which grew in complexity at the hands of
later Buddhist philosophers, who took to atomistic analysis of a speculative
sort, is presented here in this *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* with a refreshing clarity
and lucidity. Here it is explained in such a way that one can directly
experience it.

For instance in describing the earth element, the Buddha gives as examples of
the internal earth element such parts of the body as head hairs, body hairs,
nails and teeth. Because the external earth element hardly needs illustration,
nothing in particular has been mentioned as to that aspect. Anyone can easily
understand what is meant by it. There is no attempt at atomistic analysis.

However, the Buddha draws special attention to a certain first principle of great significance.

> *Yā c'eva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu, yā ca bāhirā paṭhavīdhātu,
> paṭhavīdhātur ev'esā. Taṁ netaṁ mama, neso 'ham asmi, na me so attā ti evam
> etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ. Evam etaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya
> disvā paṭhavīdhātuyā nibbindati, paṭhavīdhātuyā cittaṁ virājeti.*[^fn495]
>
> That which is the internal earth element, and that which is the external earth
> element, they are both just the earth element itself. And that should be seen
> as it is with right wisdom, thus: 'this is not mine', 'I am not this', 'this
> is not my self'. Having seen thus with right wisdom as it is, he becomes
> dejected with the earth element, he detaches his mind from the earth element.

It is this first principle that is truly important and not any kind of atomic
theory. This resolution of the internal/external conflict has in it the secret
of stopping the *saṁsāric* vortex of reiterated becoming, *saṁsāravaṭṭa*. It is
due to the very discrimination between an 'internal' and an 'external' that this
*saṁsāric* vortex is kept going.

Now in the case of a vortex, what is found inside and outside is simply water.
But all the same there is such a vehement speed and activity and a volley of
changes going on there.

So it is the case with this 'man'. What is found in his body is the earth
element. What is to be found outside is also the earth element. And yet, the
ordinary person sees quite a wide disparity between the two. Why is that? That
is because of the illusory nature of consciousness.

We have devoted a number of sermons to explain the relationship between
consciousness and name-and-form. We happened to speak of name-and-form as a
reflection or a self-image.[^fn496] Even as one who comes before a mirror, on
seeing his reflection on it, would say: 'this is mine', 'this am I', 'this is my
self', the worldling is in the habit of entertaining cravings, conceits and
views.

In fact the purpose of cravings, conceits and views is to reinforce the
distinction between an internal and an external. Already when one says 'this is
mine', one discriminates between the 'this' and 'I', taking them to be separate
realities. 'This am I' and 'this is my self' betray the same tacit assumption.

Just as by looking at a mirror one may like or dislike the image appearing on
it, these three points of view give rise to various pervert notions. All this
because of the perpetuation of the distinction between an internal and an
external, which is the situation with the ordinary worldling.

Since cravings, conceits and views thus reinforce the dichotomy between an
internal and an external, the Buddha has upheld this principle underlying the
meditation on the four elements, to resolve this conflict.

The fact that with the resolution of this conflict between the internal and the
external concerning the four elements the mind becomes emancipated is put across
to us in the following verse in the *Tālapuṭa Theragāthā*.

> *Kadā nu kaṭṭhe ca tiṇe latā ca* \
> *khandhe ime 'haṁ amite ca dhamme* \
> *ajjhattikān' eva ca bāhirāni ca* \
> *samaṁ tuleyyaṁ, tad idaṁ kadā me?*[^fn497]

This verse gives expression to Venerable Tālapuṭa Thera's aspiration to become
an *arahant*. It says:

> When shall I weigh as equal all these \
> Limitless things both internal and external, \
> Twigs, grass, creepers and these aggregates, \
> O! when shall that be for me?

It is at the stage of *arahanthood* that the internal and the external appear
alike. That is precisely why the Venerable Adhimutta Thera, whom we quoted
earlier, uttered the lines:

> *Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṁ lokaṁ,* \
> *yadā paññāya passati*.[^fn498]
>
> When one sees through wisdom, \
> The world to be comparable to grass and twigs.

The comparison is between the internal world of the five aggregates, or this
conscious body, and the inanimate objects outside.

Just as in the case of the four elements earth, water, fire and air, the Buddha
pointed out a way of liberating one's mind from the space element with the help
of similar illustrations. In explaining the space element, too, he gave easily
intelligible examples.

The internal space element is explained in terms of some apertures in the body
that are well known, namely those in the ears, nose and the mouth.[^fn499]

Apart from such instances, he did not speak of any microscopic space element, as
in scientific explanations, probably because it is irrelevant. Such an analysis
is irrelevant for this kind of reflection.

Here we have to bear in mind the fact that perception as such is a
mirage.[^fn500] However far one may go on analysing, form and space are relative
to each other like a picture and its background. A picture is viewed against its
background, which is relative to it. So also are these two concepts of form and
space. Consciousness provides the framework for the entire picture.

By way of clarification we may allude to the pre-Buddhistic attempts of Yogins
to solve this problem, solely through the method of serenity, *samatha*,
ignoring the method of insight, *vipassanā*. The procedure they followed was
somewhat on these lines:

They would first of all surmount the concept of form or matter through the first
four mental absorptions, or *jhānas*. Then as they inclined towards the
formless, what confronted them first was space. A very appropriate illustration
in this context would be the method of removing the sign of the *kasiṇa* and
attending to the space left by that removal as 'infinite' or 'boundless', in
order to arouse the base of infinity of space.[^fn501]

This mode of contemplation of space betrays the fact that space is also
something made up, or prepared, *saṅkhata*. Whatever is prepared, *saṅkhata*, is
thought out and mind made, *abhisaṅkhataṁ abhisañcetayitaṁ.*

The Buddha proclaimed that there is only one *asaṅkhata*, unprepared, that is
Nibbāna.[^fn502] But later philosophers confounded the issue by taking space
also to be *asaṅkhata*.[^fn503] They seem to have ignored its relation to the
mind in regarding causes and conditions as purely external things.

Here we see the relativity between form and space. Like the picture and its
background, form and space stand relative to each other. All this is presented
to us by attention,

> *manasikārasambhavā sabbe dhammā,*[^fn504]
>
> all things originate from attention.

Some of the later speculations about the nature of the space element are not in
consonance with the basic principles outlined in the Dhamma. Such confusion
arose probably due to a lack of understanding of the term *asaṅkhata*.

Now if we are to say something more about this particular discourse, what
remains after detaching one's mind from these five elements, namely earth,
water, fire, air and space, is a consciousness that is extremely pure.

The basic function of consciousness is discrimination. It distinguishes between
the bitter and the sweet, for instance, to say: 'this is bitter', 'this is
sweet'. Or else it distinguishes between the pleasant, the unpleasant and the
neutral with regard to feelings: 'this is pleasant', 'this is unpleasant', 'this
is neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant'.

Now that the five elements earth, water, fire, air and space, which create
discrete objects as the outward manifestations of consciousness, have been
totally removed, the residual function of consciousness amounts to a
discrimination between the three grades of feelings.

The sage who has arrived at this stage of progress on the path to Nibbāna takes
the next step by observing these three kinds of feelings, pleasant, unpleasant
and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, as they arise and cease dependent on
specific contacts, thereby gradually bringing the mind to equanimity.

He brings his mind to a stage of radiant equanimity. But even this equanimity he
does not grasp by way of me-thinking or imagining. The phrase used in this
connection is:

> *visaṁyutto naṁ vedeti,*
>
> being detached he experiences it.[^fn505]

There is a detachment, an aloofness, even in going through those sensations.
This is clearly expressed in that context.

For instance, in the case of a pleasant feeling, it is said:

> *aniccā ti pajānāti, anajjhositā ti pajānāti, anabhinanditā ti pajānāti,*
>
> he understands it to be impermanent, he understands it to be uninvolved, he
> understands it to be unrejoiced.

With the understanding of impermanence, conceit goes down. The non-involvement
does away with the views. The absence of rejoicing suggests the extinction of
craving.

So the attainment of *arahanthood* is in effect the cessation of that
consciousness itself. That consciousness is divested of its most primary
function of discriminating between the three grades of feeling, pleasant,
unpleasant and neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant.

The term *visaṁyutto* connotes disjunction, suggestive of dispassion and
detachment. In this way, the *Dhātuvibhaṅgasutta* clearly brings out the
relevance of the question of *maññanā* to the path leading to Nibbāna.

In some contexts, this practice of desisting from me-thinking or imagining is
called *atammayatā*, non-identification. This is the term used by the Buddha
throughout the *Sappurisasutta* of the *Majjhima Nikāya*. For instance we read
there:

> *Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati:
> nevasaññā-nāsaññāyatana-samāpattiyā pi kho atammayatā vuttā Bhagavatā. Yena yena
> hi maññanti, tato taṁ hoti aññathā ti.*[^fn506]
>
> The good man reflects thus: the principle of non-identification has been
> recommended by the Buddha even with regard to the attainment of the sphere of
> neither-perception-nor-non-perception thus: in whatever way they imagine about
> it, thereby it turns otherwise.

The 'good man' referred to here is the noble disciple on the supramundane path.

This term *tammaya* needs to be clarified in order to understand the
significance of this statement. It is derived from *tad* *maya*, literally 'made
of that' or 'of that stuff'. It is on a par with such terms as *sovaṇṇamaya*,
golden, and *rajatamaya*, silvery.

When one has cravings, conceits and views about something, he practically
becomes one with it due to that very grasping. In other words, he identifies
himself with it. That is why the person who has imaginings about the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which he has attained, thinks "I am one
who has attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception".

He thereby has conceit, which is a defilement in itself. As a result, when he
loses his mastery of that attainment, he becomes disconcerted. It is for that
reason that the Buddha had enjoined that one should cultivate the attitude of
*atammayatā*, or non-identification, even with regard to the attainment of the
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

The *arahant* is called *atammayo* in the sense that he does not identify
himself with anything. An *arahant* cannot be identified with what he appears to
possess. This is well expressed by the following verse in the *Devadūtavagga* of
the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*.

> *Pasayha Māraṁ abhibhuyya antakaṁ* \
> *yo ca phusī jātikkhayaṁ padhānavā* \
> *sa tādiso lokavidū sumedho* \
> *sabbesu dhammesu atammayo muni.*[^fn507]
>
> That ardent sage who has touched the extinction of birth, \
> Having overpowered Māra and conquered the Ender, \
> That Such-like one, the wise sage, the knower of the world, \
> Is aloof in regard to all phenomena.

The idea of this aloofness can be presented in another way, that is as
detachment from the seen, the heard, the sensed and the cognized, *diṭṭha, suta,
muta, viññāta*.

One of the most important suttas that merits discussion in this respect is the
*Bāhiyasutta* in the *Bodhivagga* of the *Udāna*. It is generally acclaimed as
an extremely profound discourse.

The ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya came all the way from far off Suppāraka to see the
Buddha. When he reached Jetavana monastery at Sāvatthī, he heard that the Buddha
had just left on his alms-round. Due to his extreme eagerness, he ran behind the
Buddha and, on meeting him, fell prostrate before him and begged: "May the
Exalted One preach to me the Dhamma."

The Buddha, however, seemed not so responsive, when he remarked: "Now it is
untimely, Bāhiya, we are on our alms-round."

Some might be puzzled by this attitude of the Buddha. But most probably it is
one of those skilful means of the Buddha, suggestive of his great compassion and
wisdom. It served to tone down the overenthusiastic haste of Bāhiya and to
arouse a reverential respect for the Dhamma in him.

Bāhiya repeated his request for the second time, adding: "I do not know whether
there will be a danger to the Exalted One's life or to my own life." For the
second time the Buddha refused.

It was when Bāhiya made his request for the third time that the Buddha acceded
to it by giving a terse discourse, *saṅkhitta Dhammadesanā*, of extraordinary
depth. The exhortation, brief and deep as it is, was quite apt, since Bāhiya
Dārucīriya belonged to that rare category of persons with quick understanding,
*khippābhiññā*.[^fn508]

> *Tasmātiha te, Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ: diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute
> sutamattaṁ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ
> bhavissati. Evaṁ hi te, Bāhiya,, sikkhitabbaṁ.*
>
> *Yato kho te, Bāhiya, diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṁ
> bhavissati, mute mutamattaṁ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṁ bhavissati, tato
> tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena. Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tena, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha.
> Yato tvaṁ Bāhiya na tattha, tato tvaṁ Bāhiya nev'idha na huraṁ na
> ubhayamantarena. Es'ev'anto dukkhassa*.[^fn509]

No sooner had the Buddha finished his exhortation, the ascetic Bāhiya attained
*arahanthood* then and there. Let us now try to unravel the meaning of this
abstruse discourse.

The discourse starts off abruptly, as if it had been wrested from the Buddha by
Bāhiya's repeated requests.

> *Tasmātiha, Bāhiya, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ*,
>
> well then, Bāhiya, you had better train yourself thus.

And what is that training?

> In the seen there will be just the seen, in the heard there will be just the
> heard, in the sensed there will be just the sensed, in the cognized there will
> be just the cognized. Thus, Bāhiya, should you train yourself.

It is as if the Buddha had addressed the ascetic Bāhiya in the terminology of
the *ariyans* and established him on the path to Nibbāna. Here the term *muta*,
or 'sensed', stands for whatever is experienced through the tongue, the nose,
and the body.

The basic principle in this training seems to be the discipline to stop short at
bare awareness, *diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṁ, sute sutamattaṁ*, etc. The latter half of
the discourse seems to indicate what happens when one goes through that
training. The entire discourse is a presentation of the triple training of
morality, concentration and wisdom in a nutshell.

> And when to you, Bāhiya, there will be in the seen just the seen, in the heard
> just the heard, in the sensed just the sensed, in the cognized just the
> cognized, then, Bāhiya, you are not by it. And when you are not by it, you are
> not in it. And when, Bāhiya, you are not in it, then, Bāhiya, you are neither
> here, nor there, nor in between. This itself is the end of suffering.

As a literal translation this appears cryptic enough to demand an explanation.
Let us first of all give a few clues to unravel the puzzle.

The terms 'by it', *tena*, and 'in it', *tattha*, are rather elliptical. Though
unexpressed, they seem to imply the relevance of *maññanā* to the whole problem.

As we happened to mention earlier, imaginings or methinkings by way of craving,
conceit and views, lead to an identification, for which the term used is
*tammayatā*. Such an identification makes one unsteady, for when the thing
identified with is shaken, one also gets shaken up.

This kind of imagining 'in terms of' is indicated by the elliptical *tena*, for
we get a clear proof of it in the following two lines from the *Jarāsutta* in
the *Aṭṭhakavagga* of the *Sutta Nipāta*.

> *Dhono na hi tena maññati* \
> *yad idaṁ diṭṭhasutaṁ mutesu vā*.[^fn510]

*Dhona* is a term for the *arahant* as one who has 'shaken off' all defilements.
So these lines could be rendered as follows:

> The *arahant*, the one who has shaken off, \
> Does not imagine 'in terms of' \
> Whatever is seen, heard and sensed.
