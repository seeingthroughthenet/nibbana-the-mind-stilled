# Introduction

Nibbāna – the ultimate goal of the Buddhist, has been variously understood
and interpreted in the history of Buddhist thought. One who earnestly takes up
the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path for the attainment of this goal, might
sometimes be dismayed to find this medley of views confronting him. Right View,
as the first factor of that path, has always to be in the vanguard in one's
practice. In the interests of this Right View, which one has to progressively
'straighten-up', a need for clarification before purification might sometimes be
strongly felt. It was in such a context that the present series of 33 sermons on
Nibbāna came to be delivered.

The invitation for this series of sermons came from my revered teacher, the late
Venerable Mātara Sri Ñāṇārāma Mahāthera, who was the resident meditation teacher
of Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya Meditation Centre. Under his inspiring patronage
these sermons were delivered once every fortnight before the group of resident
monks of Nissarana Vanaya, during the period from
the New Moon uposatha of 1988 Aug. 12th
to the Full Moon uposatha of 1991 Jan. 30th.

The sermons, which were originally circulated on cassettes, began issuing in
book-form only in 1997, when the first volume of the Sinhala series titled
*Nivane Niveema* came out, published by the *Dharma Grantha Mudrana Bhāraya*
(Dhamma Publications Trust) setup for the purpose in the Department of the
Public Trustee, Sri Lanka. The series is scheduled to comprise 11 volumes, of
which so far 9 have come out. The entire series is for free distribution as
*Dhamma dāna* – 'the gift of truth that excels all other gifts'. The sister
series to come out in English will comprise 7 volumes of 5 sermons each, which
will likewise be strictly for free distribution since Dhamma is price-less.

In these sermons I have attempted to trace the original meaning and significance
of the Pali term Nibbāna (Skt. *Nirvāna*) based on the evidence from the
discourses of the Pali Canon. This led to a detailed analysis and a re-appraisal
of some of the most controversial suttas on Nibbāna often quoted by scholars
in support of their interpretations. The findings, however, were not presented
as a dry scholastic exposition of mere academic interest. Since the sermons were
addressed to a meditative audience keen on *realizing Nibbāna*, edifying
similes, metaphors and illustrations had their place in the discussion. The
gamut of 33 sermons afforded sufficient scope for dealing with almost all the
salient teachings in Buddhism from a practical point of view.

The present translation, in so far as it is faithful to the original, will
reflect the same pragmatic outlook. While the findings could be of interest even
to the scholar bent on *theorizing on Nibbāna*, it is hoped that the mode of
presentation will have a special appeal for those who are keen on *realizing*
it.

I would like to follow up these few prefatory remarks with due acknowledgements
to all those who gave their help and encouragement for bringing out this
translation:
